      "We\xa0have come to the end of another year, and I believe that many people are thinking about how the year turned out. Many may even begin to feel that there are certain things that they should have done better. It is normal to have such feelings, as they can help a person to make better decisions in the future. However, it is unfruitful to dwell on the past. There is nothing to gain from living in regret about the past. Beloved, it is time to put the past behind you and begin to look forward to the glorious year that is ahead of you. <br>First of all, no matter what you have or do not have yet, you must always give thanks. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 says, <strong><em>“In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”</em></strong> Yes, the year has come to an end and you wish you had done better, but if you look closely, you will discover that you have many reasons to thank God. If you had died in the course of the year, you would not even be here to reflect on the past. There are so many things to thank God for. Show God that you are grateful because when God sees a grateful heart, He always visits that fellow with a blessing (1 Kings 3:3-15). <br>Secondly, note that God can make all things work together for your good (Romans 8:28). God can turn whatever you count as a loss into profit for you. When Joseph was thrown into prison in Genesis 39:20, it seemed like a bad experience for him; little did he know that the prison was his stepping stone to becoming the Prime Minister of the greatest nation in the world at that time. Don't ever write yourself off; always put God in the equation of your life. When you do this, you will experience a complete turnaround and His tremendous blessings will follow. <br>If, however, you have been living in sin, do not expect God to help you turn things around. He said in Isaiah 3:11, “Say unto the wicked that it shall be ill with him.” This means that it shall not be well with anyone that is living in sin. On the other hand, the Bible says in Isaiah 3:10, “Say unto the righteous, it shall be well with him.” <br>Beloved, if you want to experience God's blessings in the year ahead of you, make up your mind to live according to His will daily.",

      "A lot of people think that being a leader means that whatever they say or do is final and should not be questioned. If you are making any progress in life, criticisms will definitely come. When The Redeemed Christian Church of God was just a small church with headquarters in a small corner of Ebute-metta, no one criticised us. Now that we have branches all around the world, criticisms come in from everywhere. This is a sign of growth, and rather than being sad about it, I am happy that we have grown. <br>Some people will criticize you out of love because your success means a lot to them. Some will criticize you out of spite because they are envious of you and want you to fail. Either way, your attitude to criticism is what will determine if you will succeed or fail. Proverbs 1:5-7 says: <br><strong><em>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</em></strong> <br>Beloved, be open to suggestions from your subordinates or people who you consider younger or less experienced than you. When they tell you that you are not doing something right, listen to them without getting defensive or aggressive. If you grumble and sulk for days because you were criticized, you need to speak to yourself so that you can last. No matter what people say about you, you must never give the impression that you are above correction. Moses was the anointed one who was called by God. He spoke to God mouth to mouth (Numbers 12:8), yet the solution to the challenge he had in ministry was with his father-in-law who did not have the same intimacy with God as he did. You may be the head of your home, Chief Executive Officer or pastor, but that does not mean you know it all. <br>Believe me, every criticism is an opportunity for you to become a better person. If you take it well, you will become better. The choice is yours. Some of the decisions we made that helped us become better were responses to criticism. I know some of the critics meant harm, but God used them to show us how to do things better, and we are growing stronger for it.",

      "In Isaiah 6:1-5, Isaiah beheld God's glory and holiness, and he cried, “Woe is me!” Before then, he had been prophesying, and everyone saw him as holy. However, he looked at himself in the light of God's glory and holiness, and saw the real state he was in. <br>Beloved, it is important to have a self-reflection every now and then. Don't rely solely on what people say about you because they might not know you as well as you know yourself. They might not know the thoughts of your heart or what you do behind closed doors. Therefore, you need to look closely at yourself and perform an honest evaluation of the real state of your heart.<br>Don't judge yourself by your own standards; rather, judge yourself by God's standard. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10:18 that it is not the fellow who commends himself that is righteous, but the one that the Lord commends. Isaiah might have been judging himself by his own standards, but when he encountered God's glory, he saw that he was not in the state he was supposed to be. Judge yourself in the light of the truth in God's word; this will tell you whether you are on the right track or not. Do not judge yourself based on your feelings, what the society is saying, or on your achievements. Use God's word as a mirror, and let it show you the real you. After weighing yourself according to God's word, surrender completely to Him and ask Him to help you to live right. <br>After Isaiah's experience in Isaiah 6:1-5, he knew that the only way he could truly be holy was by God's help. You cannot be righteous by your own power; you need God to help you. Psalms 20:1-2 says that you should pray that the Lord sends help to you from the sanctuary. Until you know that you need help, help won't come from the sanctuary. You must remain in front of the mirror of God's word until you receive help to become righteous. Do not be like the man that was described in James 1:22-24; continue steadfastly in God's word. <br>1 Corinthians 11:31 says that if you judge yourself properly, you will not be judged. This means that after examining yourself, identifying your faults, and making the right adjustments, you will not be condemned when the time of judgment comes. <br>Beloved, I pray that as you make a habit of examining yourself using the standard of God, you will receive a commendation from the Master on the last day, in Jesus' name.",

      "Every human being needs redemption. This is because the natural state of fallen man is that of bondage to\xa0sin. Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God. Thank God that the redemption we got through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ has freed us from the bondage of sin. <br><strong><em>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</em></strong> <br>The forgiveness of sins (Ephesians 1:7), release from the curse of the law (Galatians 3:13), freedom from the bonds of sin (Titus 2:14; 1 Peter 1:14-18), righteousness (Romans 5:17), reconciliation with God (Colossians 1:18-20), adoption into God's family (Galatians 4:5), the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), and eternal life (John 3:16), are some of the advantages of redemption. <br>While many unbelievers see the Christian lifestyle as slavery because of its restrictions, the truth is that Christians are the ones who are free. A married woman has to submit to her husband, and that comes with restrictions, but if you ask her counterparts who are single, they will tell you that they prefer to be married. A jobless drunkard may laugh at someone who is rushing to work on a Monday morning and say that the fellow is not enjoying life. However, who is really suffering? The drunkard is the one under the bondage of alcohol. Unbelievers are locked in a prison, but they do not know it. Your prayer should be that the Almighty God should open their eyes as He opened yours and that they should come out of their prison and step into the freedom that Jesus has made available for them. <br>Beloved, do not ever be ashamed to talk about the restrictions that come with being redeemed. Yes, you are carrying the yoke of Christ, but His yoke is far lighter than that of the devil, and His burden is way easier (Matthew 11:28-30). <br>When a person becomes born again, the first thing he or she experiences is peace. A great burden is lifted off the fellow's shoulders – a burden he or she did not realise was there before. If you have not yet given your life to Christ, you are in prison.

      "Today, I will be concluding the study on the reason for the birth of Jesus Christ by looking at the impact of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. As I mentioned yesterday, Jesus paved the way for the Holy Spirit to live in believers, and the implication of this is found in John 7:38: <br><strong><em>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </em></strong><br>In other words, the Scripture above is saying that everyone who is a believer has the Holy Spirit flowing in them, giving them the power to heal the sick, raise the dead, and perform all manners of miracles. This means that, if you are a believer, the signs and wonders that Jesus Christ performed will also follow you (Mark 16:17), and you will even do greater works (John 14:12).<br>When Jesus Christ died on the cross, the veil of the inner chamber in the temple was torn into two (Matthew 27:51). This means that the manifest presence of God was no longer the exclusive reserve of the high priest. Every child of God has access to the throne of grace and can do the same things that only the high priest could do in the Old Testament. Don't see ministers of God as the only people who can work miracles; you also can work miracles if the Holy Spirit is abiding within you. <br>John 3:34 tells us that Jesus Christ was given the Holy Spirit without measure as He represents God and speaks His word as He was sent. This implies that the expression of the measure of the Holy Spirit within believers will vary with how well they fulfil the will of God for their lives. If you live holy and make a habit of spending quality time in the presence of God daily, He will keep increasing the measure of the Holy Spirit's expression in your life with evidence of signs and wonders. <br>Beloved, circumstances around you should not dictate how you should live your life. You carry the Holy Spirit within you, therefore, you should command situations and circumstances to favour you. The devil is afraid of believers using the power they have in Christ. He can only oppress those who are not exercising the power they have in Christ. <br>If you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, you have a unique advantage because of the power of the Holy Spirit that you carry inside you. Start exercising that power today, and you will see the devil tremble in fear.",

      "Over the last two days, I have been discussing the reason for the birth of Jesus Christ, and I will go a little further today. Before He was born, the Holy Spirit could only come upon certain individuals. However, after Jesus Christ came to the earth and ascended back into heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit to live inside every believer (John 14:16-17). This is why He said in Matthew 11:11 that the least in the kingdom of God is greater than John the Baptist who was the greatest of all the prophets before Him. Do you understand what that really means? It means that you are greater than Elijah, a man who called down fire from heaven at will. The birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ paved the way for God to put His very own Spirit in you. Now, you can be like Him in word and in deed. Isn't this awesome? <br>As a child of God, you carry God inside you, and this means that you are no longer an ordinary human being. You are now the temple of God. <br><strong><em>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? </em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Corinthians 3:16 <br>As the temple of God, it means that whatever cannot be found in God should not be found in you. Elisha may have died of sickness in his old age (2 Kings 13:14), but because you are carrying God inside you, sickness has no place in your body. Moses may have had anger issues, which eventually prevented him from entering the promised land, but you cannot be limited by such because God Himself is living inside you. You bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and no bad habit or weakness can find its place inside you. The Bible says in 1 John 4:4: <br><strong><em>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. </em></strong><br>You are an overcomer because the Sovereign God loves you and has made His abode inside you. Romans 8:37 also says: <br><strong><em>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. </em></strong><br>No matter what the devil throws at you, as long as the Holy Spirit is still residing in you, you will always be triumphant. Never give in to fear; remember that the Almighty God Himself is dwelling inside of you, and since He can never lose a war, you will experience victory in all areas of your life at all times.",

      "Today, I will continue the teaching I started yesterday on the reason for the birth of Jesus Christ. The Bible makes us understand that God came down in human flesh to live amongst men (John 1:14), and the beauty of this is that He felt the same pains that we feel. There is a proverb that says, “It is he who wears the shoes that knows where it pinches.” Jesus Christ wore our shoes and so, He knows exactly how we feel at every point in time. Hebrews 4:15 says: <br><strong><em>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. </em></strong><br>The best leader you can have is one who leads by example. Such leaders do not just give instructions, they also get down to do the work alongside their followers. Jesus Christ came into this world in the flesh to feel exactly what we feel. He went through the same temptations that we are going through now and showed us by example that we can live without sin. Having passed through the same things that we are passing through, He is a worthy advocate for us with the Father, such that if we fall into sin, He is there to plead with the Father on our behalf and help us get back on our feet (1 John 2:1). What great height of love this portrays! This is why in Revelation 5:1-10, He was the only one that was found worthy to open the scroll because of the sacrifices He has made to ensure that your name is written in the book of life. <br>Beloved, don't walk the journey of your Christian faith alone. Lean on God at all times. When you are feeling tempted, remember that He has also gone through the same temptation. Approach the throne of grace boldly and tell Him that you need His help (Hebrews 4:16); He is not the kind of leader that will turn His back on you. He said that you should live holy because He has also been tempted before, and He overcame, therefore, He can also help you to overcome temptations. It is easier for a sailor to sail a ship through a storm if he or she is taking directions from another sailor that has sailed through such storms before. <br>Let Jesus teach you how to live above sin, and as He teaches you, make sure that you listen to Him and obey Him. You will surely be victorious.",

      "The birth of Jesus Christ was an important moment in the history of mankind. It was a pure demonstration of the love of God for the world (John 3:16), and His ability to bring His promises to pass, even when the devil tries to fight against them. In Matthew 2:16, he influenced Herod to go to great lengths to get Jesus killed. As a result, all the children aged two years and below in Jerusalem during that period were killed. However, the devil did not succeed because God had said that Jesus Christ will bruise his head. <br><strong><em>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. </em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenesis 3:15 <br>In John 14:30, Jesus Christ said: <br><strong><em>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. </em></strong><br>By living a life that was void of sin, He successfully conquered the world (John 16:33). Through His righteousness, we can now live righteously and above the world. The Bible says in 1 John 5:4-5: <br><strong><em>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</em></strong> <br>As Christians, all we have to do is to truly believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and we will receive the power to live above sin. Philippians 2:13 says that He will work in us to do His perfect will, thereby putting an end to the sinful nature in us. <br>When we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, we are celebrating our redemption from sin. We are celebrating not just His birth, but the event that made it possible for us to become born again such that we can now call ourselves children of God. The question now is, are you really born of God? The way to know if you are truly born of God is if you are living above sin. The Bible says in 1 John 3:9: <br><strong><em>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. </em></strong><br>Beloved, don't just wine and dine in this season; understand that the birth of Jesus Christ has given you the ability to live above sin and to be victorious in the world.

      "When God says you should be holy as He is, it is not for His good. God is Almighty and All Sufficient, so your holiness will not add or remove anything from Him. Whether you decide to live holy or not, God will remain God. <br>The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Sin brings troubles, sorrow, chaos, and a low quality of life to sinners. It is a burden on the heart of a sinner. This is why lie detectors are able to detect lies because a person's heart goes through stress whenever he or she tells a lie. Many people do not live long because their heart is always stressed due to the atrocities they commit. It is wise to live holy; living holy brings peace of mind, wealth, favour with God, and long life. Most sinners think that they are very smart, however, living in sin is dangerous and can destroy them. I will rather be a fool for God so that I can live a peaceful life and enjoy all of His blessings. <br>Some people say that living holy is hard because they are trying to live holy by their own efforts. When the Bible says that you should be holy as your Father in heaven is holy, it is only saying, “Be like God.” The elders in Yorubaland where I come from usually say that when a leaf stays attached to a soap, it becomes a soap itself. When you draw close to God, you will automatically become like Him. The way to live holy is to draw close to God. The more you behold His glory, the more you're transformed into His image (2 Corinthians 3:18). <br>If you have not yet given your life to Christ, you should do that immediately; this is the first step in living a holy life. If you are a Christian, you should study your Bible daily. David said in Psalms 119:11, <strong>“Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.” </strong>When you fill your heart with God's word, there will be no space for sin to dwell in. You also need to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). When you pray, you empower your spirit above your flesh, and the temptations to sin become less effective on you (Matthew 26:41). <br>Beloved, spend quality time with God by studying His word and praying daily.

The Lord being a shade on your right hand means that His shadow will always be over you, hence, you can never be alone. There is no way you can separate a man from his shadow. It doesn't matter where you go, your shadow will always be by your side. Therefore, whenever you feel alone, remember that God is right there by your side; one of His titles is 'The Lord Who Covers You' (Psalms 121:5). I pray that the covering of the Lord will remain over you and all that concerns you at all times, in Jesus' name. <br>You may sometimes get into situations where you will look around you, and there seems to be no one to help you out. At such times, remember that God is by your side, and He is as close to you as your shadow. The Bible says in Hebrews 13:5: <strong><em>“Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”</em></strong> Our God is not a man that He should lie (Numbers 23:19). If He said that He will never leave you nor forsake you, it means that He is always by your side. He is there to protect you whenever you need protection. This is why the Bible says in Isaiah 54:17:<br><strong><em>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD</em></strong>. <br>The Shadow is there to advise you when you are confused about which decisions to make. This is why He said that you will always hear a voice behind you, telling you which way to go (Isaiah 30:21). He is there to encourage you when you feel overwhelmed by the challenges of life. That is why He said in Isaiah 41:10: <br><strong><em>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. </em></strong><br>Beloved, do not be afraid; the Lord of all lords is with you at all times. He is as close to you as your shadow. Trust Him with your life completely.",

      "God has a provision for all your needs even before you ask Him. For example, God went ahead of Abraham to provide a ram to be sacrificed in place of Isaac. This was the point where Abraham identified God as the Lord who provides (Genesis 22:14). I pray that the Lord will meet you at every point of your need, in Jesus' name. <br>Several years ago, I received my gratuity from the government, and I was excited because it was a lot of money. I had just become the General Overseer of the RCCG, and the church could barely pay me a salary, so things were quite tough at the time. While I was rejoicing, I remembered that I was now under a new management, so I turned to God and said, “Father, what do you want me to do with this money?” I thought He would ask me to pay my tithe, give an offering, and do whatever I wanted with the rest. However, He said that I should divide the money into three parts and give them to three different ministries. Then, He made a promise to me saying, “Son, I will be your source.” He has been my source ever since. Even when it looks like I am stranded, God always shows up with His timely provision. In Genesis 17:1, God reveals Himself as Jehovah El-Shaddai, the God who is more than enough. I pray that Jehovah El-Shaddai will be your source, in Jesus' name. <br>Sometime ago, I travelled to minister in the United States of America. After I finished ministering in one place, I was to fly to the next town for another ministration. However, when the plane was about to take off, it began to emit smoke and we had to disembark. The people in the next town where I was to minister were already gathering, and there were no commercial planes available at that time to fly into the town. Suddenly, the pilot of a jet that belonged to someone I know came around, and I asked him about his boss. When he heard about what had happened with my flight, he immediately told his boss, who asked him to take me to where I was going. God, the One who provides for me, already had an alternative plane waiting for me because He knew I would need it. <br>Beloved, never worry about your needs. Put your total trust in God, and He will show Himself as Jehovah Jireh and Jehovah El-Shaddai in your life.",

      "Jesus referred to Himself as the Truth in John 14:6. Since the Bible tells us in today's memory verse that the truth shall make you free, it means that if you have Jesus, you are free from bondage. John 8:36 says, <strong>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”</strong> If you have the Son, it means that you can never be in any kind of bondage. <br>The devil destroys many people by putting them in bondage. Also, when he sees that he cannot stop believers from serving God, he will look for a loophole in their lives through which he can put them in bondage. A fellow's physical strength is useless if he or she is in bondage. This is why policemen arrest people in handcuffs. It is so that they cannot escape, even if they are stronger than the policemen. <br>There are quite a lot of people who have been chained by forces of darkness. If such people engage in a business that others are prospering in, for instance, they will become bankrupt. However, there is a God, whose name is the Truth, who is willing and able to set them free. I decree today, if you are experiencing bondage in any area of your life, the forces that have held you bound shall be scattered in different directions, in Jesus' name. <br>Many Christians are in the bondage of poverty because they don't know the truth about their wealthy heritage in Christ. The greatest bondage a fellow can experience is the bondage of the mind. There are so many blessings that are available to the children of God, but unfortunately, many Christians do not access them because they don't know the Truth. The Truth is the Word of God according to John 17:17. The more you study God's word with the help of the Holy Spirit, the more you will understand your divine rights in Christ and the blessings that He has made available to you. This will ensure that the devil cannot bring you under any form of bondage. <br>Beloved, if it seems like you are experiencing bondage in any area of your life, study what the word of God says about that aspect of your life. Listen to sermons and read books by genuine men of God about that particular area of life. As you study, the entrance of the word will bring light to you, and you will be liberated forever.",

      "God's titles give us assurances of what we can get from Him. For example, one of His titles is found in Exodus 15:26 where He said, “…I am the Lord that healeth thee.” This gives believers an assurance that no matter how terrible a sickness is, Jehovah Rapha can heal them. <br>Medical doctors have different areas of specialisation, and it is standard practice for a doctor to refer patients to other doctors who are considered more knowledgeable and qualified to handle certain ailments. This was what happened to the woman with the issue of blood in Mark 5:25-34. Doctors kept referring her to other doctors until she had spent all that she had. One day, however, she came in contact with the Great Physician – the One who never refers a case – and that day, she got her healing. <br>Jesus Christ secured your healing when he was severely beaten and crucified (Isaiah 53:5). He took the stripes from the Roman soldiers so that you can confidently say that sickness and pain have no place in your body. He took your infirmities with Him to the grave; this means that they are gone forever. <br>Henceforth, I want you to know God as the God that heals you. When you read passages like Matthew 8:16 or Luke 6:19, you will see that Jesus Christ healed ALL that came to Him. There was no sickness that was difficult for Him to heal, and there was no person with too many sicknesses that He couldn't heal. If you have been dealing with any sickness or disease in your body, approach the Great Physician, He will surely heal you completely. <br>You must note, however, that healing is the bread of God's children (Mark 7:24-29). If you are not a child of God, or if you are professing to be a Christian but you are still living in sin, do not expect healing from Him. If God heals an unbeliever or a Christian who is not living holy, it is because He wants such a fellow to let go of the sins in his or her life. If the fellow does not repent and forsake his or her sins, it is very likely that a worse sickness will come upon the fellow. This was the warning that Jesus gave the man He healed at the pool of Bethesda in John 5:14. <br>Beloved, your healing has already been provided by Jesus. Surrender yourself completely to Him and walk in this divine right; He is the One that heals you.",

When God makes you a promise, He is going to fulfil it. <br>It may take a while, but every promise you have received from God will come to pass because 2 Corinthians 1:20 says that His promises are 'yea and amen'. One of His promises is that you will always overcome evil attacks because Isaiah 54:17 says clearly that no weapon that is fashioned against you will prosper. This is the promise of the Almighty God, and it can never fail. <br>Deuteronomy 28:7 says that when enemies come against you, they will be smitten before your face. In other words, you are not the one who will do the fighting; you will just watch them being defeated before your face. When they come against you in one direction, they will scatter in seven different directions (Deuteronomy 28:7). <br>Another promise is in Deuteronomy 28:13: <br><strong><em>And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them: </em></strong><br>From the Scripture above, it is evident that you will always emerge at the top, no matter what happens to you. When I was young, I used to play with house cats. I would hold a cat's four legs, put its back on the floor, and remove my hands. As soon as I removed my hands, the cat would be back on its feet in the twinkling of an eye. This affirms the saying of African elders: “The back of the cat does not touch the ground.” This is another way of saying that no matter what happens to you, you will not lose. <br>God's promise to you is that no matter what happens, you will always be the head and not the tail; you will be above, and never beneath. You must note, however, that you have a part to play for God's promises to be fulfilled in your life. <br>Beloved, if there is a promise that you are trying to activate in your life, find out the conditions attached to it in the Scriptures, do your part, and you will see that promise come to pass in your life at the right time.",

Many years ago, when I was a lecturer at the University of Ilorin, I was resting on the couch in the living room of my apartment while waiting to leave for the lecture hall. I closed my eyes because I didn't want to be disturbed, and all of a sudden, I felt hands holding my legs and hands. At first, I thought it was my wife because it felt like the fellow holding me was reaching forward as if to kiss me. However, I realised that whoever could hold my legs with one hand and my hands with the other must be really tall and strong. I opened my eyes to see a tall demon just before it disappeared. I felt a cold sensation throughout my body, but I shrugged it off because it was time to leave for my lecture. Immediately after the lecture, I started vomiting and stooling such that when I managed to drive back home, I had to practically crawl from my car into the apartment. I was in the toilet when I cried, “Daddy, what is this? How can this be happening to your son?” He then replied, “Son, I just wanted you to have a glimpse of the battles I fight for you that you are not aware of.” Afterwards, the stooling stopped. <br>Beloved, you are alive today because God loves you.

We were already on the bridge when we saw a truck coming from the other side of the bridge at top speed. We didn't know if the driver didn't see us or if he just couldn't stop; a head-on collision seemed unavoidable. There was no time to pray, but there was just enough time to shout the name of Jesus.

If a person's strength is based on physical appearance alone, then David would not have defeated Goliath (1 Samuel 17:42- 54). <br>Ecclesiastes 7:19 says that a wise man is stronger than ten mighty men. In verse 12 of that same chapter, the Bible says:<strong><em> “For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.”</em></strong> This means that wisdom, money, or both, provides strength and security. <br>Everyone has something or someone that they depend on as their strength. However, the greatest of strengths comes from above. This is why David said in Psalms 121:1-2: <br><strong><em>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. </em></strong><br>David had a source of strength that helped him overcome battles, live in prosperity, and leave a good legacy. In the Scripture above, he said that his help came from the Lord. In other words, God was his strength. The strength that comes from the Lord is absolutely reliable because, not only is it supreme, it is always constant. That strength does not ever fade; it is everlasting. Hebrews 13:8 says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. If the Lord is your strength, your strength will be constant, even in old age. Deuteronomy 34:7 says that at 120 years old, Moses was still very strong; His eyes were not dim and his natural strength had not diminished. The strength that comes from the Lord is comprehensive. Philippians 4:13 says: <br><strong><em>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. </em></strong><br>'All things' in the above Scripture includes working miracles and laying hands on the sick for their recovery. Mark 16:17-18 says: <br><strong><em>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. </em></strong><br>Beloved, do not be satisfied with your natural strength alone because it is very limited.

      "When people seek solutions to their problems outside God, they end up failing, even if it sometimes seems they were solved initially. The advantage we have as God's children is that we have a Father who never fails. The worst verdict any sick fellow can hear from a doctor is, “There is nothing more we can do.” However, when doctors reach their limit, the Almighty God can step into the situation and bring total healing because He is limitless. <br>Years ago, a woman told me that her daughter in the United States of America was pregnant and was about to deliver. The doctors discovered that the baby was too big to be delivered naturally, so they decided to perform a surgical procedure to bring the baby out. When they tested her blood, they discovered another issue – she was suffering from a very rare disease that would not allow her blood to clot. This meant that they also could not operate on her because she would bleed to death. God told me to ask the mother to bring two handkerchiefs for me to pray over. Even though I didn't understand why, I relayed the message to her, and she obeyed. After praying over the handkerchiefs, I told her to travel to meet her daughter in the hospital and lay one of the handkerchiefs on her. When she got to her daughter, she laid one handkerchief on her as I instructed. The following morning, the handkerchief was missing. They searched everywhere, and they just couldn't find it. The woman then said, “Thank God I brought two handkerchiefs.” She tied the second handkerchief firmly to her daughter's wrist and asked the doctors to wait to see what happens. The doctors said they could only wait until 10am, after which they will bring out the baby and take their chances with the mother. By 8am however, the baby that they said couldn’t come naturally was delivered safely.' If you cry out to Jesus when faced with an impossible situation, He will show up for you. <br>God said in Psalms 50:15 that you should call on Him in the day of trouble and He will answer. I want to advise that before that day of trouble comes, ensure that you are close to God so that He will listen to you when you call. Isaiah 59:1 says that He is not deaf, but sin can stop Him from hearing a person’s call. Live holy so that in the day of trouble, when you call on God, He will hear you.",

Therefore, one can say that having wisdom is a very good thing. <br>In 1 Corinthians 1:20, the Bible says: <br><strong>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? </strong><br>From the Scripture above, we know that there is something called 'the wisdom of this world', and that God can turn this wisdom into foolishness. However, the question is, what is the wisdom of this world? <br>The wisdom of this world is any kind of wisdom that is not of God. In other words, any kind of wisdom that does not agree with the word of God is the wisdom of this world. It may seem good and also seem to yield temporary results, but if it is not of God, it will eventually become foolishness. In the same Scripture that was quoted above, the Bible tells us that when the wisdom of this world was turned into foolishness, the wise men of the world were nowhere to be found. They could no longer make a case for their kind of wisdom. <br>Some people are boasting now, arguing that their kind of wisdom is the best because it appears to be yielding results for them, either in helping them to make money, or to get into positions of power and so on. However, because their wisdom is not based on the word of God, a time is coming when they will hide their faces in shame because it will be made foolishness. <br>Beloved, do not be moved by the methods and recommendations of men, even though they might seem very logical. If their recommendations are not based on what the word of God says, they are foolishness, and you should not partake of such. The Lord has superior wisdom for you, and He said that you only need to ask in order to get it (James 1:5). When you begin to use His wisdom, you may seem foolish at first to the people who are using the wisdom of the world, but I tell you from experience, sooner or later, you will have excellent results. Better still, your results will endure, and you will keep on excelling, long after the so-called results of the people who relied on the wisdom of the world have been forgotten.",

    bodyText:
      "Today's Bible reading says that two are better than one. This is because, if one person falls, the other can lift him up. For instance, if a fellow is walking alone at night and is suddenly attacked by some miscreants, that fellow would most likely find it more difficult to fend off the attackers than if he or she had company. It is indeed not good to be alone (Ecclesiastes 4:11). <br>There are battles you may never win if you fight alone, but if you have the right people on your side, you will stand a better chance of winning. There is an exponential increase in strength when a fellow is not alone. Deuteronomy 32:30 says: <br><strong><em>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up? </em></strong><br>While it is good to have friends, it is important to choose the right ones. A popular saying goes thus: “Two heads are better than one.” However, that saying has been adjusted in recent times to be, “Two good heads are better than one.” Evil communication corrupts good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33). Who is your friend? Is your friend making you better or making you worse? If you have a friend who is corrupting your good manners, you should separate from such a fellow as he or she can cause you a lot of trouble. There are many people in prison today because of the kind of friend they had. <br>Make sure your friends are people with good heads on their shoulders. If you put a bad apple in a bowl with good ones, the bad apple will make the others rotten as well. If you have just one bad fellow in your group of friends, that one fellow will likely pull everyone down. It is better to stay away from such a person. Proverbs 13:20 says that the companion of fools shall be destroyed. Don't allow yourself to be destroyed. <br>If you are unmarried, you must be extra careful when choosing a spouse. It is better not to be married at all than to get married to a bad spouse. Take your time to hear from God first. Get many confirmations that the fellow you want to get married to is not a fool. Do not think you can change him or her after marriage. <br>Beloved, your friendships and associations can greatly impact your life. Do not keep company with the wrong crowd.",

    memorizeVerse: "Ecclesiastes 10:19",
    bodyText:
      "Today's memory verse says that money answers all\xa0things. Truly, when someone has money, that person has a level of power because he or she can pay to get so many things done, some of which would have probably been impossible without money. <br>I saw an inscription many years ago which said, “When money is speaking, nobody checks the grammar.” Nobody checks the grammar because most people are at the beck and call of a rich man. Even when he does something wrong, not many people are bold enough to correct him. Hence, money truly can give a person a level of power. <br>As powerful as money can be, however, Proverbs 23:5 says that it can grow wings and fly away. Also, even though money is powerful, there's a limit to what it can achieve. For example, it was recorded in the Bible that when there was a famine in Egypt, money failed (Genesis 47:15-16). In modern terms, this can mean that money no longer retains the value that it once had. For instance, in recent times, due to economic hardship, the currencies of many countries have lost so much value. <br>Since money can fail, it is not something you should rely on. There are many rich people who had the money for the best medical care in the world, but their money could not save their loved ones. There are people with state-of-the-art beds in their houses who can hardly sleep. Also, there are people with enough money to feed a city, who cannot eat what they want because of a health condition. You should not put your trust in money as whoever does so will be greatly disappointed. Proverbs 11:28 says: <br><strong><em>He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</em></strong> <br>If a fellow has all the money in the world but does not have Jesus, he or she is finished. There is absolutely no profit in having all the money in the world and missing heaven (Mark 8:36). Only Jesus can be relied on; only He can stand by you to help you when everything else fails. Only He can give you and the generations after you a glorious future here on earth and in eternity.<br>Beloved, the money you have in your bank account, as much as it may be, can fail you. Do not put your trust in riches; rather, put your trust in Jesus. He loves you, and He will never fail you.",

      "In Proverbs 20:29, the Bible says that the glory of young men is their strength, and the beauty of old men is their grey head. When you are young, you are strong and agile, and you have the strength to jump around and work for long hours. However, the Bible says in Isaiah 40:30: <br><strong><em>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</em></strong> <br>The strength that comes with youthfulness does not last forever. David was a valiant warrior when he was young; not only did he kill Goliath, he also trained other giant killers. However, a point came in his life when he fainted and would have died in battle if someone had not come to his rescue (2 Samuel 21:15-22). <br>The glory of the youth is in their strength; however, this strength must not be used selfishly. Rather, it must be used primarily to serve God. If you are a youth, you should not use your strength to engage in sexual immorality or pursue worldly pleasures. Rather, use your strength to work for God as this is the primary reason for making you strong. There are many people today who constantly regret how they spent their youth. Some of them do not have a stable marriage or a good source of income because of how they lived their lives when they were much younger. They sacrificed having a good future on the altar of 'having fun'. <br>If you are a youth, you need to be careful of the seeds you are sowing now because you will surely reap them in the future. Ecclesiastes 11:9-10 says: <br><strong><em>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</em></strong> <br>You should put evil far away from you, especially if you are a youth reading this. Your strength as a youth will not last forever. When this youthful strength is gone, and you become old, you will have to face the results of the seeds that you sowed in your youth. <br>Beloved, serve the Lord with all your strength now.

      "The most important reason God created your mouth is for you to sing and shout to Him. This is why He said in Psalms 98:4: <br><strong><em>Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. </em></strong><br>In the passage above, God was commanding the whole earth, not just a few people, to make a loud noise unto Him. In other words, He was telling the sea to roar His praises, the trees to clap for Him, and the birds to sing. Likewise, since you are on the earth, your voice must not be missing in this great choir. David said in Psalms 119:164: <br><strong><em>Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. </em></strong><br>God created your mouth principally to sing His praise and to shout unto Him. You may not be able to sing as beautifully as the choristers in your church, but God knows that everybody can shout. That is why He said in Psalms 98:4 that you should make a joyful noise unto Him. <br>There is a story in Matthew 12:22 that illustrates how important the mouth is to God. A man was brought to Jesus Christ, and the Bible says that the man was blind and dumb. Jesus healed the man, and he began to speak and see. It is interesting to note the order in which the Bible recorded the miracle; the man was 'blind and dumb', but then the Bible recorded that he 'spoke and saw'. This shows that Jesus healed the man's mouth first before his eyes. <br>If you have not been shouting and singing to God before, start doing so henceforth. When you are in the bathroom, sing praises to Him. When you are walking along the road, let a chorus be in your mouth. When you are in church, and the minister on the pulpit asks you to shout Halleluyah, shout at the top of your voice. God loves it when you praise Him. When you shout and sing to Him, He is pleased with you and will draw near to you. The Bible says in Psalms 22:3: <br><strong><em>But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. </em></strong><br>When you open your mouth to praise God at all times, He will draw near to you and abide with you continually. As a result, you will enjoy the numerous pleasures in His presence forevermore (Psalms 16:11) and experience His peace at all times, irrespective of what is going on around you.

Yesterday, I taught about God's purpose for your hands, and today, I will be teaching about the legs. <br>One of the main reasons God created your legs is so that they can dance for Him. Psalms 150:4 says: <br><strong><em>Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.</em></strong> <br>God expects you to use your legs to dance for Him. In today's Bible reading, a man was born lame, and even though he always sat at the gate of the temple and could hear the praises from inside, he couldn't dance. On that fateful day, he asked the apostles for money, but God had arranged for his legs to finally be able to dance for Him. He didn't get the money he asked for, but Peter took him by the hand, and his ankle bones received strength. The Bible says that he entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God. May you always have reasons to dance, in Jesus' name. <br>If you want to know how important dancing is to God, you should read 2 Samuel 6:14-23. In that passage, David was dancing to God, but his wife reprimanded him because she thought that he had abased himself by dancing shamelessly. God was so upset with her, and as a result, she never had a child until she died. No matter how great you become in life, you must always ensure that you use your legs to dance for the One who lifted you. <br>Many years ago, we were at a meeting of pastors. During the praise session, I closed my eyes to avoid distractions as I danced to the King of kings. One of the men of God needed to get my attention for something, but he couldn’t, because my eyes were shut. When he finally got me to open my eyes, he said, “Look at you, don't you know you are a General Overseer?” I ignored him because I was dancing to the One who made me a General Overseer, and I will keep dancing for Him until my last breath. <br>Beloved, ensure that you always show your gratitude to God by praising Him and dancing for Him. This way, He will continue to lift you up, and you will never cease to experience the beauty of His salvation (Psalms 149:3-4).",

In fact, every part of your body was created specifically to give pleasure to God.

In Mark 3:1-5, Jesus Christ healed the man with the withered hand, even though the leaders of the synagogue didn't want Him to heal on the Sabbath day. God did not create the hands to be withered; the hands are meant to clap for Him. This was why, even though the man with the withered hand did not ask Jesus for healing, it was very important to Jesus that the man's hand be made whole. <br>There are people whose hands do not look withered physically, however, when a fellow's hands cannot achieve as much as they used to, they can be considered to be withered. Also, when a fellow cannot spend as much as before, or when he or she cannot get certain things done as before, the fellow's hands can be said to be withered. When a person's hands are withered, he or she cannot be joyful, and when the person is not joyful, he or she will not be able to clap. I decree today, that if you have a withered hand, it will be restored, in Jesus' name. <br>If God has ensured that your hands do not become withered, then you will be ungrateful if you do not clap for Him in worship. If a fellow is ungrateful to God for His goodness and blessings, his or her hands are in danger of becoming withered. An ungrateful person is indirectly asking for his or her hands to be withered. <br>Beloved, I implore you to take a minute to think about all of the great and mighty things that God has done for you, and how great and powerful He is.

      "Power can simply be defined as the ability to do work. Sometimes, you can tell that a person is powerful based on his or her physical appearance. However, there is another kind of power that cannot be judged based on physical appearance alone. For example, in Judges 15:14-15, when Samson took the jawbone of an ass and killed a thousand Philistines, amongst other great acts he performed, the Philistines could tell that he had extraordinary strength. This was why they asked Delilah to find out the source of his extraordinary strength (Judges 16:4-5). What they didn't know was that the Holy Spirit always came upon him to give him the power to do the things that he did. Unfortunately, sin made him lose his power (Judges 16:20). <br>Not long after I got born again, I got a letter inviting me to my village for a programme. When I told my mother that I was going to honour the invitation, she became afraid because I had run away from the village after some people threatened to have me for breakfast. By this, they meant that they were going to kill me using diabolic powers. I told my mother that I was now born again and no weapon fashioned against me can prosper. She replied that I didn't look different at all, and asked how I was sure that I was now powerful. I told her that an electric wire that has electricity running through it and one that doesn't, both look alike. However, anyone who touches the one with electricity will know the difference. When you become born again, greater is He that is now in you than He that is in the world (1 John 4:4). <br>There are certain things that are needed to keep a fellow strong.

On their way, the Lord told him of His plan to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because of their numerous sins. I believe that God told Abraham His plan because He wanted him to intercede for the people in those cities. <br>Abraham interceded, and God accepted everything that he said. However, there were not enough righteous people in Sodom and Gomorrah, so they still ended up being destroyed. This shows that even when God calls for intercessors to pray against destruction in a particular nation or city, if He cannot find enough Christians there, the land may still be destroyed. <br>When Abraham was interceding for Sodom, his nephew, Lot, must have been on his mind. I am sure that he quickly did a little bit of Arithmetic and counted Lot, his wife, and his daughters. He also probably assumed that Lot's daughters had fiancés whose parents were also there. After his quick calculation, he must have come to the conclusion that there must have been at least ten children of God in the city. That must have been the reason he settled with God and said, “Lord, if you get to Sodom and find ten righteous people, will you spare the city because of them?” God accepted, but unfortunately, there weren't up to ten righteous people in the city. I pray that whenever God visits your hometown, He will find more than ten righteous people there, and His mercy will prevail over judgment. <br>This is why you should do something urgently about your hometown.

As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</em></strong><br>When you become overwhelmed, and all you need is for your enemies to be scattered, cry unto God and say, “Oh Lord, Arise!” He said in Psalms 50:15 that you should call on Him in the day of trouble, and He will answer you. I have discovered from the Scriptures and from personal experiences that whenever a genuine child of God is faced with overwhelming situations and circumstances, and he or she cries for God to arise and fight the battle, God always shows up.<br>In 2 Kings 19:14-19, King Hezekiah cried to the Lord when a mighty army decided to wage war against Judah. He knew that Judah did not stand any chance against the mighty Assyrian army; therefore, he reported the matter to God. God arose for Judah, and in that same night, the angel of the Lord went into the camp of the Assyrian army and killed 185,000soldiers. Hezekiah did not even need to raise an army to fightagainst the Assyrians; God took care of them Himself.<br>Beloved, do not despair when you are faced with seemingly impossible situations. Cry unto God, and He will surely arise to deliver you.",

      "It is a terrible thing to miss the time of divine visitation. In Acts 3:1-11, the Bible tells us of a man who was born lame and who was always sitting at the gate of the temple. He could have decided to sit anywhere else in Jerusalem and beg for alms, but he chose to position himself where God would easily find him. He chose to sit at the gate of His temple, and the day of his divine visitation eventually came. You never can tell when theAlmighty God will pay you a visit.<br>If you are a member of your church choir, there is usually a time that is allotted for rehearsals. If that is where God expects you to be at that particular time, He can decideto visit you there with your blessings. Some people left the place that God expected them to be, and by doing so, they were not available at the time He sent their miracleto them. When you are feeling tempted not to go where God expects you to go, or you feel like leaving where He expects you to be, whether it is a church service or aplace of spiritual assignment, it means that the devil is trying to make you miss your blessing. May you not miss your day of visitation, in Jesus' name.<br>Apart from missing the time of divine visitation by not being in the right place at the right time, the devil also tries to get believers to be in the wrong places so that he can carry out his evil plans on them. There was a man who was killed when some robbers came to his house. The robbers had been watching him closely, and they knew that he was supposed to be in church at that time. However, on that particular day, he decided to stay at home rather than attend church service. When the robbers were caught, they confessed that they decided to rob the house because they thought that the man wouldbe in church. When they met him at home, they couldn't let him live because he saw their faces.<br>Beloved, be consistent in your walk with God and in your service to Him. Surrender all to Him and be diligent in doing what He has called you to do. He will surely visit you and reward you as you keep doing what He tells you to do (Ephesians 6:8).",

      "There is no place in the Bible that says you are to fight for yourself. Rather, what the Bible says is, “<strong><em>The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.”</em></strong> (Exodus 14:14). Also, the memory verse for today says that you should not avenge yourself, for vengeance is the Lord's.<br>The reason God tells you not to fight for yourself or avenge yourself is that you belong to Him, and He is responsible for you. Therefore, if anyone comes to fight you, He is the One who will stand up to fight. Hence, whenever you fight for yourself, you are telling God that you own yourself and you can take care of yourself. In essence, you are tellingHim to stay out of your matter. Believe me, if God stays out of a person's matter, he or she is finished (Lamentations 3:22).<br>Some people think that they are strong, therefore, they are quick to stand up to any fight. As for me, I know that I am not strong at all. If you see any strength in me, it is because Christ strengthens me (Philippians 4:13). Without Christ, I am just a weakling. This is why, whenever I am faced with any opposition, I always tell whoever is confronting me, “If it is me you are fighting, you have won, even before the fight starts, because I have no power. However, if it is God you are fighting, then I pity you.” This has always been my disposition because God has assured me of rest and safety in Him. I know that in quietness and confidence shall my strength be (Isaiah 30:15), for I am more than a conqueror through Christ who loves me (Romans 8:37). Ever since Imade the decision to put all my trust in Him, He has never let me down and He never will (Deuteronomy 31:6).<br>Beloved, you are stronger when you are quiet and confident in the ability of the Lord to fight for you. People who confront you already think that they are stronger than you, therefore, when you shout and try to fight for yourself, you will only make them feel stronger. However, when you are quiet but confident, they will know that the One who is greater than the greatest is behind you, and they will leave you alone. If they however choose to continue to challenge you, they will be destroyed by the Lord of hosts whom you put your confidence in.",

      "When people sing, dance, and even cry while worshipping God, it will look as if they are worshipping God in spirit and in truth. However, only God knows those who are truly worshipping Him and those who are just faking it.<br>In our Bible reading for today, we see one of the major indicators of fake worship. Saul was only worshipping God so that the elders, and all the people of Israel, could see that he was worshipping. If you only worship God in church for people to see you, then that is not true worship. When genuine worshippers worship God in public, it is an offshootof what they have been doing in private. They actually prefer to worship God in private so that they can freely express themselves, rather than in public, where they would beconscious of the people that are around them.<br>Another indicator of fake worship is when your worship consists only of clapping, singing, and dancing, without seeking to know and obey God. If you do not seek to do His will at all times, but only like to sing worship songs, you are only enjoying good music; you are not truly worshipping. Real worship is about pleasing God, not just singing, enjoying good music, and feeling good about yourself. True worshippers daily seek to know God and obey His commandments. They give their hearts completely to God and seek to glorify Him with everything in their lives. This is because, 1 Corinthians 10:31 says:<strong><em> “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”</em></strong><br>True worship comes from the heart; it is not a jamboree. True worshippers are so in love with God that they worship Him by serving Him and giving to His work in tithes and offerings. They also worship God by putting Him first in everything that they do. They are addicted to spending time in His presence and cannot imagine being separated from Him. Like David, a true worshipper would say:<br><strong><em>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Psalms 42:1-2</strong><br>The essence of true worship lies in obedience and glorifying God in our lives, rather than offering sacrifices to Him with our mouths only.

It is only the grace and favour of God that has brought us this far (1 Corinthians 15:10). If you think that you are successful because of how smart or brilliant you are, myquestion for you is, did you create your brain? Could you have single-handedly created the opportunities that you had while climbing the ladder of success?<br>The Bible tells us in Colossians 1:16-17 that all things exist in God and were created by Him and for Him. Everything we are and have is by God's provision and by His grace alone. This is why today's Bible reading tells us that no one can boast before God.<br>Even though I can be considered brilliant because I obtained a PhD in Mathematics, I could have ended up as a farmer in my small hometown, Ifewara, if God had not given me the kind of mother that I had. She supported my dream to go to school in every way she could, and if this had not happened, I would not be where I am today. This is why I cannot afford to be proud because I know my humble beginnings, and I did not get to where I am today solely by my efforts. God raised me by His grace and mercy, and He can also pull me down. In the Bible, even though King Saul was initially aware of his humble state before he was crowned king (1 Samuel 15:17), pride began to set in his heart as time went by. He got to a point where he began to feel like he needed more respect from people. Consequently, he lost his position and the kingdom was taken away from him (1 Samuel 15:22-31). By the time we get to 1 Samuel 16:1, God was telling Samuel not to waste his time praying for Saul because He had rejected him.<br>Beloved, do not allow pride into your heart. The moment a fellow becomes proud, destruction is waiting at the door (Proverbs 16:18). Never forget about God's abundantgrace, and be careful never to think that you are superior to other people.

      "Today, I will be concluding the teaching I started yesterday on prophesying with wisdom. In our Bible reading for today, God sent Nathan to announce King David's punishment. As a wise prophet, Nathan knew that the way he communicated God's message would determine if he would leave the palace alive that day or not. Therefore, he started the message with a parable. When the king himself pronounced judgment based on his parable, he said, “That fellow is you, sir.” There is a powerful lesson for you to learn from here: when God sends a message through you to someone, you must be careful about the way you relay that message to the fellow.<br>If God tells you something about somebody, don't be in a hurry to tell the fellow. Ask God for wisdom to relay the message in the right way so that no one gets in trouble because of the prophecy. Over time, I have learnt to do this. This is why I often give prophecies in the form of parables. If God has told me something and I am to share itwith the public, if I know that the thing can be tough for some people to swallow, I will say it in the form of a parable. This way, I communicate God's message with wisdom.<br>I have also seen people who use the gift of prophecy to destroy families. If God tells you something about someone and He says you should tell the fellow, after asking God for wisdom on how to relay the message, you might also need to advise the fellow on how to use the information that he or she now has. This is because such a fellow might not have the same level of wisdom and understanding as you. If he or she lacks understanding or is not mature enough to handle the message appropriately, the devil can take advantage of this and push the fellow into taking actions that will cause more harm than good. If you know that the fellow may not use the prophecy correctly, and God is not compelling you to reveal the message, you may decide to just approach the person with general advice and guidance concerning that issue. This way, you can help him or her without causing any trouble.<br>Beloved, the gift of prophecy is to perfect the saints, not to confuse or endanger them (Ephesians 4:11-12); use it wisely!",

There are certain things God tells you that are for your ears only. If you become so excited that you start telling them to people that He has not permitted you to share them with, you might cause more harm than good. God likes to share secrets with those that are close to Him. If He tells you a secret, you should ask Him if it is okay to share it with anyone. The moment He tells you a secret, and you tell someone that He has not permitted you to, He might stop speaking to you.<br>You must note that the gift of prophecy should not be used to show off that you are close to God. Prophecies must be handled with care because some people might not be able to receive, understand, and interpret what God is saying correctly.<br>When God tells you something about a particular fellow, you are not to say that thing in public except He specifically asks you to do so. If the fellow He spoke to you about is a public figure, find a way to send a message to him or her privately about what God told you. When God told Samuel that King Saul had offended Him, Samuel did not announce it to the entire kingdom. Our God is not a gossip. If He gives you information about someone, it is not for you to discuss it with the whole world. You must pay particular attention to this, especially when the prophecy is not a pleasant one. Even if such a fellow would have received your prophecy well, hearing it in public might make him or her defensive, and as such, the aim of that prophecy will be defeated. Also, God can change His mind about such a fellow if he or she begins to do the right thing as we see in Isaiah 38:1-5.

It is also okay to use new approaches to share the gospel. However, the ancient landmarks must remain intact. The moment a fellow begins to explain away some of the basic principles of Christianity in the Bible, that fellow is already on the wrong path. For example, 2 Corinthians 6:14 says clearly that believers should not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. Some youths, in a bid to be modern, say that it is not bad to marry someone who is not a Christian. They claim that they are practising a less rigid Christianity than that of their parents. This can be potentially dangerous because someone who is an unbeliever will not understand the things of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 2:14) and will most likely oppose them or persecute the believer because of them.<br>Some people say that I am old school, and I agree, after all, I serve the Ancient of Days.

Many people, however, feel that the rapture is not real because they have heard of it for so long and it hasn't happened yet. Whatever anyone thinks about the reality of the rapture does not matter. It is in your best interest to study and believe only what the word of God says about it. The Bible says that the day will come like a thief in the night and you must be prepared if you do not want to be left behind (1 Thessalonians 5:1-8).<br>A key characteristic of the major prophecies in the Bible is that they sounded unbelievable when they were spoken. When Isaiah prophesied that a virgin would give birth in Isaiah 7:14, it seemed very unreasonable. At that time, most people must have watched to see if a virgin would really give birth. It wasn't until centuries later that Marygave birth to Jesus Christ. Whether the people believed Isaiah's prophecy or not, God's word came to pass. In the Bible, there were numerous prophecies that seemed impossible but have come to pass. If the Bible has been so accurate, it is wise to believe that it is absolutely right about the rapture.<br>When Noah announced to everyone that a flood was coming to destroy the whole earth, they laughed at him. He started building the ark, and they laughed even more. Years passed, and no flood came. Just before he went into the ark with his family, the people were still drinking and rejoicing like every other day, but a few days after, they had all drowned. Today, many people are living recklessly, ignoring the reality of the rapture. However, the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:52 that the rapture will happen suddenly. Only those who are prepared for it will be saved while the rest will be left on the earth to suffer.<br>One thing I know for sure is that the day the rapture happens, many people will be caught by surprise. There will be a lot of regrets from people who heard about the rapture, but who lived their lives without bothering to prepare for it by giving their lives to Jesus Christ and living holy. Unfortunately for them, it will be too late because the rapture will only happen once. <br>Beloved, are you ready for the rapture?",

If she had not done what she did, she might have died a sick and wretched woman.<br>Do you know that you can get a miracle even when a minister of God is not praying for you? You can be at a programme, and while a ministration is going on, if you say to yourself just like the woman with the issue of blood, “If I can just touch the hem of His garment, I will receive my miracle,” God will do it.<br>One of our drummers in RCCG had been waiting on God for the fruit of the womb. One day, while the Holy Ghost Service was going on, he said in his heart, “If the General Overseer can just look at me, I will have my child.” I didn't know what was going on, I just looked his way, and he was very excited. Nine months later, his baby came. There was also a woman many years ago who had heard of the great things God was doing through us. She decided to come for one of our programmes and said in her heart, “If I can just see the man of God, I will receive my healing.” When I came up, she asked those around her to confirm that the fellow on the altar was me. When they confirmed it, she started rejoicing, and she got her miracle.<br>If you have faith, you can get your miracle at any time. Even if a minister of God does not mention your case or lay hands on you during a ministration, you can get a miracle from God through him. You don't have to wait for a minister of God to pray for you. You can get a miracle through him or her with your faith.",

For example, in Genesis 18, He was going to Sodom, but on His way, He stopped at Abraham's tent to give him a miracle. Also, in Luke 7:11-15, Jesus was going into the city of Nain and He saw a dead man being carried to his grave. He touched the coffin, and immediately, the dead man came back to life.<br>Psalms 97:3 says that fire goes before God. In other words, He has a convoy that goes before Him that is made of fire. This means that whenever He is moving, fire goes ahead of Him, clearing everything that is evil, and preparing the way for the One whose name is 'Consuming Fire'. Even if you are not the one that God is coming to see, as He is passing by your house, everything that is considered evil in your home will be dealt with. When the One who is passing by is the Almighty God Himself, then no sickness, pain, sorrow, poverty, or anything evil, will remain.<br>Beloved, this is why it is good to have Christian neighbours.

The Bible saysthat righteousness exalts a nation (Proverbs 14:34), therefore, if you are surrounded by righteous people, God will move more frequently within your community, ensuring that you and the entire community are continually blessed in Him.<br>You should note, however, that the Consuming Fire hates sin. Therefore, when He moves, everything that relates to sin in His path will be destroyed. This is why you must abstain from sin because you do not want to become a victim of the Consuming Fire whenever He is moving around you.<br>Beloved, ensure that you live a holy life and also surround yourself with true children of God so that whenever God moves around you, you will receive a miracle.",

Do you have a friend who can inject himself with a disease so thatyou will not be infected with it? This can be likened to what Jesus did in Matthew 8:17.

      "In conclusion of the teaching I started two days ago on gender and sexuality, I will like to share an experience I had with you. Some years ago, I was in one of the Western nations to preach, and a journalist interviewed me about my views on same-sex marriage. I told the fellow interviewing me that God made men and women to reproduce after their kind. Then I asked, “Is it possible for people of the same gender to produce offspring?” I concluded by telling the interviewer that if everyone was getting married to someone of the same sex, the world will come to an end in this generation.<br>As a child of God, whenever you have the opportunity to speak about homosexuality, don't beat around the bush. The reason evil thrives is that good people are too afraid to say the truth. Don't keep quiet when people say that they are sexually attracted to people of the same gender as them. Don't judge or condemn them, rather, tell them the truth with love. Condemning them will only make them put up a fight, and our God is not a God of condemnation, but of love. Speak to them in love, but still show them from the Scriptures that what they are feeling is not from God because He clearly speaks against it. Tell them that you are willing to pray with them and help them overcome thatfeeling.<br>Today's Bible reading tells us what happens to people when they are left to their reprobate minds; such people cannot end well unless they repent. Stand firm againsthomosexuality and do everything you can to show people that are sexually attracted to individuals of the same sex the right way to live from the Scriptures. Lot stood firm against homosexuality in Genesis 19:1-7, even when he was under severe pressure. He did not allow the men of Sodom to come into his house to have sexual relations with the angels that he invited in, even though they pressed on him greatly and were going to break into his home.<br>Beloved, I know that in some countries, the government has made it illegal to speak the truth as regards homosexuality. However, we have a greater government in Christ, and we must represent Him everywhere we go.

      "Today, I will continue my teaching on what the Bible says about gender and sexuality. The Bible makes it clear in today's memory verse, that it is an abomination to have sexual relations with someone of the same gender. Homosexuality might have been painted as normal in some societies, but anyone who engages in it is committing an abomination. Today's Bible reading says that if people who engage in homosexuality do not repent, their souls will be cut off from amongst the people. It says further that the nations and places in which such acts are encouraged will be punished and will not know peace. Do not imbibe these ideologies from such societies; the word of God is 'yea' and 'amen'. God's word says that such people and societies will be punished, so we must stay away from their ideologies and intensify our prayers for them.<br>When you read about Sodom and Gomorrah, the cities that God destroyed with fire and brimstone, you will see what can happen to societies that are defiled by homosexuality (Genesis 19:1-25). Even though they were initially said to be flourishing and seemed like the perfect places to live in (Genesis 13:8-12), they were eventually destroyed due to the wickedness and immoral acts of their inhabitants. Even after they were invaded by enemies and Abraham came to their rescue in Genesis 14:1-16, they continued proudly in their abominations, and this eventually led to their destruction. In Isaiah 3:9, the Bible says:<br><strong><em>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</em></strong><br>Beloved, do not partake of such evil rewards. Don't believe the lie that some people are born homosexual. Homosexuality is an abomination before God because it was not part of His original design; it is a devilish act that is intended to destroy the lives of people and tamper with the work of God. If you have been engaging in homosexuality, pray to God for deliverance from the manipulation of the devil, and see a genuine minister of God to pray with you. Beloved, God loves you and brought this message to you so that you can either be delivered or be used to deliver others.",

      "We live in a world today where many are confused about their sexuality and gender. Some Christians are also confused about what to believe concerning the topic. Over the next few days, I will be digging deep into the Scriptures to explain the truth aboutsexuality and gender.<br>First of all, I will like to emphasise that God created man in His own image, and He created them male and female (Genesis 1:27); anything outside this is not God's design, neither is it His will. When an artist creates a masterpiece, the artist puts his or her signature on it. Every human being is God's masterpiece and is uniquely made, such that no two people in this world have the same fingerprints. If someone takes a masterpiece and decides to change something about it, it immediately ceases to be a masterpiece. People who decide to change their gender are destroying the essence oftheir creation. They are telling God – their creator – that they can do a better job at creating.<br>One thing I know is that my God does not make mistakes. Therefore, when someone says that she feels like she is a male trapped inside a female body for instance, I immediately know that the devil is at work and is trying to manipulate her to destroy her body which is God's masterpiece. Changing God's original design concerning our bodies can be disastrous because the Bible warns that our bodies are God's temple and that God will destroy whoever defiles His temple (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). There are records of many people who have altered their genders admitting that they are suffering serious health and emotional trauma as a result of their decisions. A person cannot tamper with God's masterpiece and not suffer the consequences if he or she doesnot repent.<br>One of our pastors was arrested because he addressed a group of people as, “Ladies and gentlemen.” They told him that not all of them were ladies or gentlemen. When I heard this, I wondered, “How many genders did God create?” Your body is the temple of God, and any advice to disfigure it is from the devil. If you feel confused about your identity, draw closer to God, study your Bible, and pray more than ever before. Also, speak to a Christian counsellor who holds firmly to God's position about gender and sexuality. God will show you who you really are in Him and His purpose for your life. He had a plan for you, even before you were formed in your mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:5).",

This particular kind of people seek worldly pleasures onlyand have no self-control. As a matter of fact, they can be likened to zombies. A zombie is a fictional entity that does not have a mind of its own. It is controlled by a basic urge to feed and is literally a dead man walking. If you are always lured by things that give your flesh pleasure, it means that your flesh is ruling over your spirit. This also implies spiritual death. You must gain full control over yourself. Do not let the urge to sleep overcome the need to work. Do not let the urge to eat overcome the need to fast. The key to remaining in control of your life is to be disciplined. The price of discipline far outweighs the cost of indiscipline. A fellow who always gives in to pleasure will die poor. This is what the Bible tells us in Proverbs 21:17:<br><strong><em>He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</em></strong><br>Nobody ever achieves anything great by giving in to pleasure all the time. Anyone who does this will come into this world and leave unnoticed. <br>Being a lover of pleasure is so dangerous that the Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 that you should not associate with people who only seek the pleasures of life. It says that you must turn away from people who love pleasure and themselves more than they love God. A tree does not eat its own fruit. It exists to cater for the needs of others. In the same vein, people are created to impact others and contribute positively to society. They are not created to only serve themselves.<br>When some people talk about self-love, what they are actually talking about is selfishness. If you want to really live, then you must make an impact on those around you. Anyone who is only living for himself or herself is already dying. The best way to impact those around you is to bring them out of darkness into the light of Christ.

This is why after Isaiah received that kiss of fire, all he could hear was God saying, “Whom shall we send, who will go for us?” and his response was, “Lord, send me” (Isaiah 6:1-8). When you are kissed by fire, you will begin to hear the heartbeat of God concerning the nations of the world, and your response will be, “Lord, send me anywhere to do your work, and I will go.”<br>Paul did God's work with great zeal.

That light was not from an electric bulb; it was from the fire of God, and the moment Paul's body touched it, he was kissed by fire and was changed forever. From that moment, he went to every length to do the will of God.<br>The reason many Christians find it difficult to do great exploits for God is that they have not been kissed by fire. Some of them want to serve God in greater capacities, but they lack the required zeal because they have not been kissed by fire. If you are a pastor, and you want to have an army that is willing to join you in doing great exploits for the kingdom, pray for them to be kissed by fire.

He placed the marked barks at theplace the sheep usually drank from so that whenever they came to drink, they would see them. He also ensured that the animals faced the marked barks whenever they were mating.

      "Children often look up to their parents, and this is no different in God's kingdom. A son might strive to learn all he can from his father in the Lord and even pray to carry his spirit. However, what do fathers stand to gain from their children in the Lord? When you consider the fact that there was a school of prophets in Israel, where Elijah could have gotten many people to help him, you will realise that he did not really need Elisha.<br>The primary reason a father sticks close to his children in the Lord is usually that he wants to pass his knowledge and anointing to them. He does not want everything he has gotten from God to die with him; he wants to pass them on to people that will carry on after he is gone. Thus, it is the willingness of fathers to teach, and their children in the Lord to learn, that builds such a strong bond between them. Just as in the case of Elijah and Elisha in 2 Kings 2:11, fathers will one day be taken from the earth, and theirchildren in the Lord will be faced with the reality of carrying on to greater heights without them. How ready are you for the time you will need to carry on from yourfather in the Lord?<br>Your vision in your walk with God must go beyond your father in the Lord, otherwise, when he is gone, your walk with God may be affected. My Father in the Lord was a great man of God. He fasted and prayed more than anyone I knew at that time. He saw visions of the future, and I learnt a lot from him. However, he told me that he never fasted beyond 21 days at a stretch. Not long after he went to be with the Lord, I moved beyond that and started fasting for 40 days at a go once every year. He saw the Church spreading across the world, and that has come to pass, however, God has further expanded the vision to other areas like establishing the Redeemer’s University where young people can obtain a university degree and be equipped spiritually while doing so.<br>If you want your father in the Lord to be proud of you, while you are learning all you can from him before he leaves the earth, you must also see beyond him in your daily walk with God.",

      "Sometimes, when you hear from God, it may be a Srebuke. However, you must still open your heart to Him despite the rebuke. In any case, I would rather God rebuke me than stay silent. If a Christian only wants to hear sweet things from God but never wants to listen to His rebuke, he or she will eventually stop hearing from Him. You should be glad when God rebukes you because Hebrews 12:6 says that it is the child the father loves that he chastens. When David was rebuked in 2 Samuel 12:1-14, he did not harden his heart, rather, he repented, and God continued to walk with him.<br>How do you react when you hear a rebuke from your pastor? Do you harden your heart or do you make amends immediately? No matter how influential a believer is in ministry, or how gifted the fellow is in the Holy Spirit, if such a person hardens his or her heart against God's rebuke, God can reject such a believer (1 Samuel 16:1). Psalms 51:17says:<br><strong><em>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</em></strong><br>If you want God to keep walking with you and speaking to you, you need to have a broken spirit and a contrite heart. God is not moved by mere religious activity; He is most interested in a relationship with you. However, just as it is impossible to have a good relationship with someone that you cannot correct when he or she offends you, God will not dwell with hard-hearted individuals. He said in Isaiah 57:15:<br><strong><em>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</em></strong><br>Beloved, when God rebukes you, whether through His word, a fellow believer, or directly by Himself, never harden your heart. Hardening your heart against His rebuke will only lead to destruction as we see in Proverbs 29:1:<br><strong><em>He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</em></strong><br>Do not despise rebuke from God, rather, embrace His correction as evidence of His love for you.",

However, you still need to hear from Him on how to go about what He wants you to do. For example, when Paul wanted to go to Asia in Acts 16:6-7, the Spirit of God forbade him. You might ask, “How can the Spirit of God stop Paul from going to preach since it is written in Matthew 28:19 that we should go into the world and teach every nation?”<br>Some years ago, I wanted to hold a crusade in Benin, a state capital in Southern Nigeria. We had prepared everything for the crusade, but to my surprise, when I went to ask God about it, He said that we should go to Ede, a town in South-West Nigeria instead. I told Him that we had just concluded a crusade in Ilesha, another town in the same state as Ede and that the inhabitants of Ede would have most likely been in attendance. However, since God is my Commander-in-chief, I obeyed Him.<br>During the crusade in Ede, the king was in attendance, and when he got on the stage to speak, he announced that he would be gifting the church with whatever quantity of land we desired. We initially decided to ask for 50 acres of land, however, when I went back to hear from God, He told me to ask for 500 hectares, and I obeyed. Today, that portion of land is where Redeemer's University and The Redeemed Christian School of Missions are situated. If I had hardened my heart, I wouldn't have gone to Ede, and I wouldn't have received the blessing.<br>Beloved, when you are dealing with God, don't harden your heart.

This is why you will always hear me say, “The elders have a saying,” because there are valuable things that I have learnt from the elders that all of my formal education did not give me.<br>I was privileged to sit at the feet of my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi.

He taught me many things, even though I didn't agree with some of them initially because I felt that they were incorrect. However, as I grew older, I began to realise that he was correct. One of the things he taught me was that I should always remember that I am not God, irrespective of the level of the anointing that I operate in. He also taught me that God does whatever He pleases, and all that I have to do is to take my burdens to Him in prayer and go to bed. This is why, if you ask those close to me, they will tell you that I have no difficulty sleeping. No matter how big the problem is, once I have prayed, I go to sleep.<br>Beloved, even if your parents and the elders around you are not as educated or sophisticated as you are, listen to them.

      "The last words of a dying man are usually very important and must be given the utmost attention. More importantly, we should pay extra attention to the last words of Jesus before He left the earth because they are extremely important. When my Father in the Lord was about to leave the earth, he sent for me, but unfortunately, I had gone to Akure, a state capital in Western Nigeria, to preach. Up until today, I still wish that I was there to hear what he wanted to tell me at that crucial moment in his life.<br>In John 3:16, Jesus said that God loves the whole world and sent Him to die for everyone, but when He was saying His last prayers in John 17:9, He said, “I'm not praying for the world, I'm only praying for these people that You have given me.” This means that if a fellow is not born again, he or she cannot experience certain benefits of God’s love. As a matter of fact, Jesus Christ said that He will deny such a fellow before His Father on the day of judgement (Matthew 10:32-33).<br>Those of us that are truly born again must also pay closeattention to Jesus' last words before His crucifixion and death. In His final prayer before His arrest and crucifixion, He said:<br><strong><em>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>John 17:20-21</strong><br>It is very important to Jesus Christ, the Head of the church, that believers are united. God's glory can only be seen upon the church when there is unity and when Christians are of the same mind. In Psalms 133, the Bible tells us that God's anointing and blessings will flow freely within His church when we are united as brethren. You should not hold grudges or keep malice with your brothers and sisters in Christ. Even though a Christian belongs to another denomination and you have a disagreement, bear in mind that you both belong to God, and all Christians are His children.<br>Beloved, ensure that you always show love to the Christians around you in spite of your differences.

Beyond hearing in the physical, it is also critical for believers to be able to hear from God as we see in our memory verse.<br>Due to my training as a mathematician, I have learnt todelve into things that are not obvious. For instance, many Christians miss out on the fact that Elisha and Elijah were talking as they walked together in 2 Kings 2:11. When I studied that Scripture, I wondered what their discussion was about. Also, in Daniel 3, when the three Hebrew men were with the fourth man in the fire, what were they talking about? What did Jesus discuss with Moses and Elijah in Matthew 17:1-9? What was so crucial that they came down from heaven to discuss with Jesus? In 2 Corinthians 12:1-4, Paul said that he heard words that were not lawful for a man to speak. What were those words? In Revelation 10:4, John heard some things and wanted to write them down, but the angel told him they were not to be written; they were for his ears alone. What did he hear? I am really curious about these and many more of such conversations.<br>God made the world with words. Words are very powerful, especially when they come from God. The Bible says that the entrance of His word always brings light to the hearer and to situations (Psalms 119:130). You cannot live an effective Christian life if you do not hear from God. The Bible teaches that if you believe, you will see the glory of God (John 11:40). However, this faith comes by hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17). Psalms 107:20 says, “He sent His word, and He healed and delivered them.” The question is, how do you receive God's word?<br>To receive God's word effectively, ensure that nothing distracts you and that you are totally focused on listening to His word. Move away from distractions, so that you can hear exactly what God wants to say to you in that moment. Also, pray for God to open your spiritual ears so that you can understand what is being said.<br>In Revelations 2:29, the Bible says that those that have ears should hear what the spirit is saying.

      "The Christian walk is very unique. This is because Christianity is dependent on an individual's ability to believe. As a result of this, Christians are generally called 'believers'. A scientist might say, “Prove it to me, and I will believe you,” but in Christendom, God says, “Believe Me, and I will prove it to you.” This is the mystery of Christianity.<br>To an unbeliever, our faith is proof that we, as Christians, are not wise. This is because a natural man cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14). However, in 1 Corinthians 1:27, the Bible tells us that God uses the foolish things of this world to confound the wise. For example, it does not make sense to unbelievers when we say that a virgin gave birth to Jesus Christ. Most times, they think to themselves, “How can a virgin give birth?”<br>Jesus said something very important in our memory verse for today. He said that only those who are like children will inherit the kingdom. In other words, you must believe Him like a child believes his or her parents, whether what they say makes sense or not. Many people make the mistake of trying to relate with God logically. This is impossible because the Bible says that God's ways and thoughts are beyond human comprehension (Isaiah 55:8-9).<br>There are people who argue against Christianity with logic. Do not argue with such people because you cannot explain Christianity logically. Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:23-25 to avoid unnecessary arguments with people concerning the truth of God's word.<br>The way to prove that God is real is not through arguments but by the display of power as Elijah did in 1 Kings 18.

Once you have shared the gospel of Christ with unbelievers, commit their hearts to God, as it is only the Holy Spirit that can convict and convert them. Do not argue with them about your Christian faith, rather, ask God to use you for signs and wonders so that when they see the power of God, they will surrender without any argument.<br>Beloved, I pray that the power of God will be evident in your life and that He will use you to lead many people into His kingdom, in Jesus' name.",

In Acts 11:1-18, after he had gone to Cornelius' house and the congregation gathered together to query him for going to a gentile's house, he stood firm as a rock and said, “The Spirit bade me go.” He was no longer scared to stand on what he believed.<br>Get filled with the Holy Spirit, and you will know the truth of God's word so much that it will be difficult to be deceived by false doctrines.",

When they finally get married, they worry about whether they have taken the right decision and if they will ever have children. They are always worrying about the future. Honestly, all that worrying will not solve anything.<br>When you read Philippians 4:6-7, you will see what you should be doing instead of worrying. It says you should be thanking God in everything by prayer and supplication.<br><strong><em>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</em></strong><br>Don't thank God only when things are going the way you like; thank God in everything by prayer and supplication, and then let your requests be known to God. Don't just sit there and worry; go to God in prayer, thank Him for the things He has done for you, and then make your requests known to Him. His peace will replace every form of worry in your heart. So, rather than worry, pray to God, and He will meet you at the point of your needs.<br>If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour and have surrendered your life to Him, stop worrying. Jesus has already given you His peace that passes all understanding, as we see in John 14:27:<br>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.",

      "The Bible says you should seek God while He may be found and call on Him while He is near. Once you hear that, the next question on your mind should be, “How do I know when God may be found or when He is near?” That question is very valid. However, what you really need to know is how to draw Him near to you. John 4:23-24 says:<br><strong><em>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</em></strong><br>The Scripture above tells me that rather than trying to seek God while He may be found when I cannot even see Him, if I worship Him in spirit and in truth, He will be the One toseek me out. Instead of me calling Him without knowing whether He is near or far, if I just concentrate on worshipping Him, He will draw near to me. If you want God to always be near you, you must be committed to worshipping Him like no one else does. He is drawn to people that worship Him. Psalms 22:3 says that God inhabits the praises of Israel. Israel here refers to those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.<br>People generally move towards where they are being praised. Where I'm from in the Western part of Nigeria, if you are at a party and the musician suddenly starts singingyour praises, it is expected that you will stand on your feet and go towards him or her dancing. That is what happens when we sing praises to God; He draws near us. This is one major secret that David knew, which made God answer His prayers. He said that whenever he wanted to approach God, he went in with praises and thanksgiving (Psalm100:4). By the time he had praised and thanked God for a while, he will find himself in the very courts of God. Once he had God near him, he could call on Him and be sure toreceive answers to his prayers.<br>Beloved, henceforth, deliberately draw God close to you at all times with praise and worship.",

      "For everything we do, whether it is something we are saying, an action we are taking, or a decision we are making, there is a spirit within us influencing it. In Matthew 16:13-23, Peter was saying to Jesus Christ in one moment that He is the Christ, to which Jesus Christ said flesh and blood could not have revealed it to him, implying that only the Spirit of God could have revealed that to him. Not long after, the same Peter said to the Lord, “You will not die,” and the Lord turned to him and said, “Get thee behind me satan.” This tells us that we must always check what spirit is influencing our actions. You can be a powerful man of God, filled with the Holy Ghost, and still be influencedby the devil.<br>When you read in 1 John 4:1 that you should test all spirits, don't just conduct tests on the spirits in other people; conduct a test on the spirit influencing you too. Check the things that you are doing, saying and believing; check if they are in line with the Spirit of God.<br>How do you check what spirit is influencing you? Matthew 7:16-17 says:<br><strong><em>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</em></strong><br>Check the fruits you are bearing. Check if they are in line with the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23. <br>If what you are doing does not show love, you are not being influenced by the Spirit of God. If you are doing something that is opposed to peace, it is another spirit influencing you. If a Christian decides to do something outside the will of God because he or she does not want to suffer for God's will, he or she is following the will of the devil.<br>Beloved, you must always check what spirit is influencing you at every point in time. Agood way to know is to check if your decisions and actions are in line with the variousexpressions of the fruit of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5:22-23.

If you are a Christian and your decisions and actions do not reflect the fruit of the spirit, retrace your steps to being influenced by the Spirit of God only.",

      "When you make a claim in a law court, you will be asked to provide an evidence to show that what you are saying is true. The purpose of the evidence is to validate your claim and show everyone that you are sure of what you are saying. If you have evidence, you will confidently present it to support your claim. If you, however, do not have any evidence, it will be hard to have that kind of confidence.

Matthew 21:21 says:<br><strong><em>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</em></strong><br>Beware, however, because the devil will try to send fear into your heart.

In Joshua 1:8, the Bible says that to have good success, the word of God must never depart from your mouth. Note that it did not say from your heart but from your mouth.<br>Beloved, if you desire anything in your life, pray about it in faith and declare God's word concerning it without any doubts.",

We all need to take a break every now and then so that we can be refreshed enough to be effective at what He has called us to do.<br>Many people break down because they hardly take breaks. Some people have been working for years without taking any vacation. What they don't understand is that taking time to rest will help them to be more effective when they resume their work. In 1 Kings19:1-8, Elijah had just called fire down from heaven and brought revival to the land. Then, he heard that Jezebel wanted to kill him and ran for his life. By the time he gotto the juniper tree, he was tired, and in that state, he asked God to kill him. God knew that he really didn't want to die; he just needed to take a break. He made him fall asleep and sent an angel to feed him twice. After resting and eating well, he was strengthened to continue for the next 40 days. Sometimes, the reason you feel frustrated is that you have not taken a break in a while. Just try sleeping and eating only for one day, and you will see the difference.<br>Taking a break is not expensive. If you don't have money to travel or check into a hotel, you can go to a family member's house or any quiet place where you know thatno one will disturb you, and just rest there. You need to rest weekly and yearly also, especially after a strenuous period of work, as Elijah did in 1 Kings 18. No matterhow anointed you are, as long as you are still in the flesh, you need to take a break once in a while. The only reason I have been able to host the Holy Ghost Service everymonth for almost 40 years is that I take breaks when necessary.

Elijah gave Elisha a condition to meet in order to get the double portion in spite of the fact that he had been serving Elijah for so long. If Elisha had not met that single condition, he would have gotten nothing from his father at his departure. Many people think that getting blessed by a powerful man of God is enough to make them great. Yes, the blessing is powerful, but if a person does not wrestle out his or her greatness, such a fellow will remain on the same level. Your father may have settled some things on your behalf, but you still have your own individual wrestling to do if you want to access those things.<br>In Genesis 27:26-30, Isaac blessed Jacob with an irreversible blessing. For sure, Jacob was going to be great, however, he had to wrestle to get the change of name that set him up for the benefits of the blessings he had received (Genesis 32:1-30). Many rich people's children think that because their parents are rich, they can never be poor.History is full of examples of people whose parents were very rich but who ended up poor. If you don't wrestle out your own greatness, you will eventually lose whateverinheritance is laid down for you. Some pastors' children think that their parents' anointing makes them immune to the devil and assures them of making heaven. However, Ezekiel 18:20 says that the soul that sinneth shall die. If you are a sinner, your father's righteousness or anointing cannot cover you. You must meet God for yourself and build a relationship with Him if you want to enjoy the benefits of what your father carries.<br>Without Pa Josiah Akindayomi, you might not know Adeboye today.

      "Today, I will conclude the teaching on the challenges of being successful by looking at the temptation to enjoy the praises of men and not returning the glory to God. When you become successful, people will shower you with a lot of praise and might even give you glory for things that you didn't do. For example, after David killed Goliath, some womenbegan singing, “Saul killed his thousands, David his ten thousands,” even though it was clear that it was God who gave him victory over Goliath. This got David in trouble with Saul and Saul began seeking to kill him (1 Samuel 18:6-9).<br>Beware of the praises of men. Sometimes you will not be able to stop them, but you must pay no attention to them because the moment you start doing so, you will begin to feel like you are on top of the world, and before you know it, you will be taking the glory instead of giving it to God. It was the praises of men that got Herod in trouble such that he was eaten up by worms in the presence of those who were praising him (Acts 12:22-23).<br>The praises of men can become so addictive that you will want to hear them all the time. King Saul wanted to please the people all the time so that they could keep praising him, even to the point of disobeying God (1 Samuel 15:24). When you are doing well, people will praise you as if you are the best in the world. You should beware,because the moment you get so addicted to their praise and it drives you outside God's will, you will realise that you are just mere dust.<br>There was a man that was regarded as being almost as powerful as my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, in those days. He, however, let the praises of the peopleget into his head and eventually broke away with a large chunk of the church. By the time he died, he had a congregation of less than 50 people. 1 Corinthians 10:11 tells us that certain things happened to some people so that we can learn from them. Don't listen to the praises of people, as they will make you start doing things that you will end up regretting if you are not careful.

Today, I will look at another major challenge of success, which is the fact that everybody wants to be friends with the successful. When you are successful, you will have manypeople around you, and it will be difficult to tell those that have good intentions apart from those that do not.<br>The mere fact that you are at the top will attract many 'friends' to you. This is why you must be careful to put your trust in God and not man. Some people will do everythingto work their way into your heart just because of what they want to get from you. You will need the gift of discernment of spirits to know those that are genuine and those that are not.<br>In 2 Samuel 13:4-5, Jonadab advised Prince Amnon like he really cared about him. Amnon went ahead and did as he advised. When the repercussion of that evil counselcame, Jonadab did not rise up to defend his friend; he was the one who went to announce Amnon's death to David (2 Samuel 13:32-33). He told the king, “Let the king cheer up, for Amnon only is dead.” If Amnon had been wise, he would have seen earlier that Jonadab was not a real friend. Real friends will not always say 'yes' to your desires.Sometimes, they will say 'no' because they care about you. When you have people who never tell you the hard truth and who will keep supporting you, even when you are clearly going the wrong way, run from such people.<br>The higher you go, the more careful you have to become in choosing the kind of people you allow into your life. If you are trying not to be lonely as you go higher, and youkeep many friends, you will end up having many with negative intentions around you. You should have fewer friends as you go higher, not because you don't like beingfriendly, but because you will discover that most people care more about what you can give them than who you are to them. As a result, your circle of friends shouldbecome really small as you advance in life.

I may not be able to share all of them with you in this series, but I hope that what you learn will help you prepare for success because you will be successful unto the end, in Jesus' name.<br>The first challenge of success is pride. In Genesis 48:1-20, the blessing of the firstborn was transferred to Ephraim by his grandfather, and as a result, he became greater than his elder brother, Manasseh. Pride set in, and God kept pleading with him, but he wasn't listening. Then, in Hosea 4:16-19, God said that Ephraim should be left alone. By the time we get to Hosea 5:9, God said, “Ephraim shall be desolate.” In Revelation 7:5-8, when the various tribes of Israel were being sealed, Ephraim was no longer there. The pride that came with Ephraim's success ended up destroying him.<br>Proverbs 16:18 says:<br><strong><em>Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</em></strong><br>Those who are down can fear no fall. The higher you go, the more cautious you should be of falling, and that caution should drive you to be more humble as you rise.<br>James 4:6 says:<br><strong><em>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</em></strong><br>It is only by God's grace that you are able to attain and sustain success. If you become proud, God will withdraw His grace, and the result of that will be disgrace. Don't let God resist you; don't allow pride into your heart. Do everything to ensure that you don't think of yourself as more important than you really are. Don't look down on others, and don't see anything as being too low for you. Let Matthew 20:26-28 keep ringing in your head, that the one who will be the greatest must be the servant of all.<br>Jesus Christ showed us an example of service and humility in John 13:1-17.

This means that you must be careful about what you decree because they will come to pass. This is why I am always concerned when I see parents who say negative things over their children carelessly. Proverbs 22:15 says that there is foolishness in the heart of a child; I know some children can be naughty, however, the way you respond to their behaviour will go a long way in determining whether those children will turn out good or become worse.<br>As a parent, how do you respond to your children's behaviours? Do you make negative pronouncements like, “You are useless; you can't amount to anything,” or positivedeclarations like, “You are for signs and wonders. It doesn't matter what the devil may try, you will succeed.” Whatever you say is what will happen. There is power in your tongue and this power is even more potent over your children because they came into the world through you. As a parent, God has given you power over the future of your children, not so that you can destroy it, but so that you can shape theminto what He wants them to become.<br>In our Bible reading for today, Jacob came to Isaac and got a blessing. As soon as he left, Esau came in, and Isaac told him that he had blessed Jacob and that he will be blessed. Whatever you speak over your children, especially when your emotions are stirred up, will stick and will be reinforced. After Jacob got the blessings and was on the run, he encountered God in Genesis 28:12-22, and God didn't say anything about the fact that he cheated. He didn't say, “You cheated your brother and you will pay for it.” I thought that Jacob would have been scolded, but God established the blessing he got from his father.<br>Beloved, please decree good things over your children. Whether they hurt you or not, remember that whatever you say will happen to them. Don't say something that will affect them negatively; you will regret it later. You will account for every word you speak over your children, and whatever they become will reflect on you also. Speak blessings over your children at all times.",

      "Many people do not take the issue of who their spiritual father is seriously. Some people say that they have multiple fathers; such people are bastards because no human being can have more than one father. The role of your spiritual father in your life is very important. Even though Elijah said that Elisha, his spiritual son, had asked for a hard thing, he practically committed God to give a double portion of his spirit to him (2 Kings 2:9-15). That is a good example of the role a spiritual father can play in a fellow's destiny.<br>If you claim to have a spiritual father, you must do some things to prove it. If you are disobedient to your spiritual father, you are not his true child, and you cannot get thethings that you expect to get from him. Also, a grown-up child will take care of his parents. If you don't sow anything, either in the form of service or material resources, into the life of your spiritual father, God will not recognise that relationship. 2 Kings 3:11 says that Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah. That is what made their father-son relationship valid and qualified Elisha to get the double portion of his father's spirit.<br>One night, during my prayer walk, some people met me and asked me to pray with them. For them not to disturb my prayers, I simply told them, “God bless you.” As Iwent further, a fellow who was driving a bus passed by me and stopped. He took the little money he had in the bus, ran to me, and gave it to me. That time, when I said,“God bless you,” it was from the depth of my heart. The money was not much, but he showed that I am truly his father so he could get something from me. When Isaacasked Esau to prepare food for him, it was not because he was hungry or that he could not afford to feed himself, he was telling the young man, “Spoil me so that I can blessyou from my heart.” There are blessings that come from the heart of your father; such blessings can never be reversed, as we see in Genesis 27:33-37.<br>Do what will make your spiritual father so willing to bless you that, even if what you ask for is beyond his control, he will commit God to give it to you.",

      "Today's memory verse says that in everything you get, you must get wisdom. In other words, wisdom is the most important thing you can get. <br>More interestingly, the Bible reading for today tells us that wisdom is crying in the streets: <br><strong><em>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</em></strong> Proverbs 1:20 <br>Unfortunately, many people ignore the cry of wisdom and are not interested in her. People who do not heed the cry of wisdom usually suffer the consequences of being foolish, and it may be too late by the time they realise it. For people who will let wisdom pour out her spirit on them and teach them her words, she always makes herself available, and they are tremendously blessed for it. I am sure you are asking yourself, “How can I get wisdom?” Psalms 111:10 says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If you want to be wise, the place to start from is to fear God and prove that you fear Him. Proverbs 16:6 says that the fear of the Lord is to depart from evil. Every time people commit sin, they are simply displaying foolishness. Daniel 2:20-22 says that it is God who gives wisdom to the wise. If a fellow does not have a relationship with God, he or she cannot get wisdom. <br>James 1:5 says: <br><strong><em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</em></strong> <br>The way to get wisdom is first to fear God and then simply ask Him for wisdom; it is as simple as that. Now, because wisdom is the correct application of knowledge, the limit to your wisdom will be how limited you are in knowledge. As you ask God for wisdom, you must also increase in knowledge so that you will keep increasing in wisdom. This is why I am always reading books. I want to learn something new every day, even if I have to ask someone to teach me. <br>Beloved, wisdom indeed is the principal thing. Jesus Christ is the wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:24) and you must accept Him as your Lord and Saviour if you want to be wise.",

      "In\xa0my primary school days, our teacher told us the story of a man who offended his king. The king was very angry and called the man concerning the issue. The man immediately got on his knees and pleaded for mercy. He admitted his offence and said that he was very sorry. The king pardoned him because of his repentant heart. Our teacher told us that if we are wrong and admit it while asking for mercy, we will obtain mercy. However, if we try to cover our wrongs, we will surely get punished. The lesson stuck with me, and so, when I do something wrong, I don't try to cover it. If I offend God, I turn to Him and say, “Lord, I have offended you, please have mercy on me.” <br>If you want to obtain mercy from God, you must not cover any sins that you commit. The reason God always had mercy on David is that he never tried to cover his sins; rather, he would confess them to God. In 1 Chronicles 21:1-16, when Gad came to tell David that he had offended God, not only did David accept his wrong, he called the elders to fast and pray with him for forgiveness. Compare that to Saul in 1 Samuel 15:20-21. After Samuel had come to tell him that he had not carried out God's instruction to the letter, he made excuses instead of accepting his wrong. When Samuel refused to worship God with him, he did not plead with him to help appease God, rather, he pulled Samuel's skirt just because he didn't want the elders to see Samuel walking away from him. He clearly wasn't making the sacrifice to ask for mercy, he was doing it to cover his sin and make everything look alright. 1 Samuel 3:19 tells us that God honoured Samuel and never allowed his words to fall to the ground, but in 1 Samuel 16:1, as much as Samuel pleaded for Saul, God said that he should not waste his time because He had rejected Saul. <br>Beloved, covering your sins will land you in destruction. When you do something wrong, don't try to keep up appearances. Your Christian life is not about publicity, it is more of your personal relationship with the King of kings. Confess your sins and plead with God for mercy. When you do that, He will have mercy on you, but if you cover your sins, you are risking His total rejection.",

If we are friends, I don't need to ask you. A friend gives to his or her friend without him or her asking.” <br>When lovers are in a courtship and there is no exchange of gifts between them, no matter how small, that love might just be questionable because one of the major ways of demonstrating love is by giving (John 3:16). <br>Many people claim to be God's friends, but from their reaction when it comes to giving to God, you will realise that they are not. Real friends of God will not wait until an announcement is made for offerings to be made to God before giving to Him. Real friends of God will constantly look for ways to give to Him because of how much they love Him. <br>I recall a time that I went to minister at a church some years ago, and everyone in the congregation was looking so radiant. By looking at them, you could tell that God had really blessed them. I was thinking about how blessed they were when the minister on the altar said, “It's offering time.” You could see the joy in the auditorium as they all clapped and shouted. Then, God told me, “This is why I have blessed them so much; they give to me cheerfully.” Those who are always happy to give to God, and who don't need to be cajoled or asked before they do so, always enjoy abundant blessings. God sees them as His genuine friends, so He also doesn't wait for them to ask before giving to them. <br>David was a man who always wanted to give to God. He said in 1 Chronicles 21:24 that he would never give God anything that costs him nothing. As a result, God said that He had given him everything he ever wanted and that if he wanted more, He would have given him (2 Samuel 12:8). He never let him lack anything because he was His friend indeed. God never asked Abraham for a tithe in Genesis 14:20 before Abraham gave it to Him. Nowadays, even after God has said that we should bring tithes into His house (Malachi 3:10-12), some Christians still argue about whether they should pay tithes or not.

From our memory verse today, you will realise that if you are merciful to others, you will also enjoy God's mercy. Psalms 130:3 says that if God were to count our iniquities, we will not stand. It is only by His mercy that we are still alive, and if we are wise, we will also have mercy on those around us. <br>In our Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ told the story of a man who owed the king ten thousand talents. The king commanded that he and his family be sold in order to pay the debt, but the man asked for mercy, and the king forgave him of the debt. The same man went out and saw someone that owed him a hundred pence. His debtor begged for a little more time to pay his debt, but this man refused to forgive the debtor and locked him in prison. The king heard about it, withdrew his mercy, and gave the unmerciful servant to tormentors. Proverbs 11:17 says: <br><strong><em>The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.</em></strong> <br>The Scripture above says that when you are merciful, you are doing good to yourself, but if you are cruel, you are hurting yourself because your cruelty will only rob you of the mercies of God. <br>In John 14:23, Jesus said if you love Him, His Father will love you, and both of them will come and dwell in you. How do you show God that you love Him? 1 John 4:21 says that if you love God, then you must love your brother. Love your neighbour like yourself because you cannot say you love God and hate your neighbour. If you decide not to love your neighbour, you are telling God that you don't need His love. Galatians 6:7 says: <br><strong><em>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</em></strong> <br>Whatever you sow is what you will reap. If you sow mercy into the lives of others, you will reap mercy. However, if you decide to sow unforgiveness, then do not complain when you reap unforgiveness (Job 4:8).",

Psalms 115:3 says that God is sovereign, He does as He pleases, but if you know Him well, you can position yourself such that the Almighty will do what you want. <br>Going by today's memory verse, if you can find what God's word says about what you want and align yourself with it, He will be committed to doing His part. For example, Psalms 75:6-7 says that promotion comes from God. 1 Samuel 2:7-8 also says that God decides whom to raise and whom to bring down. Since you know this, the question now becomes, “How do I get God to promote me?” The answer is in 1 Peter 5:6: <br><strong><em>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</em></strong> <br>Therefore, if you notice that it seems like it is taking a long time for God to promote you, then you can make up your mind to be humble. Once you are humble, He will be committed to exalting you in order to fulfil His word. Proverbs 22:29 says that if you are diligent in your business, you will stand before kings. Proverbs 12:24 also says that the hand of the diligent shall bear rule. Therefore, if you want to get to the very top, you must add diligence to your humility, and in line with God's word, He will raise you so high that you will be in the category of kings. You can get God to do what you want if you do what He wants. <br>The devil, however, also knows this principle. When he doesn't want God to do something for you, he tempts you to do something wrong so that he can accuse you before God and commit God not to bless you. This is why Revelation 12:10 calls him the accuser of the brethren. He knows that God will not go against His word, so he tempts you into committing sin and accuses you before God. This is why it is foolish to obey the one who has decided to destroy you by committing sin. When next the devil tempts you, tell him, “I refuse to be a fool.” <br>Beloved, never give the devil the opportunity to use God's word against you, rather, use God's word to your favour by always praying according to His will.",

Now, they can't even shout hallelujah at the top of their voices. No matter how big a fellow is, he or she is still nothing before God. If a person is too big to dance for Him, He can decide to show that fellow how small he or she really is. <br>One day, I asked God, “Lord, David did a lot of terrible things, even more than Saul, yet You said David was a man after Your heart while You rejected Saul. I know that You are not partial, but I am curious to know why.” He responded, “What did David do in 2 Samuel 6:14?” I replied, “He danced with all his might.” Then He asked, “Can you show me a place in the Bible where Saul danced for me?” That was when I really knew why God rejected Saul.

He may pursue a variety of personal objectives, amass wealth, achieve success in one field or the other, or gain pleasure in one thing or another, but soon he will discover that they are all momentary and unsatisfying without Christ. No matter how rich you become, Ecclesiastes 5:10 says that money doesn't satisfy. In Christ, you have everything you need for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3). <br>In Ephesians 2:1, Apostle Paul referred to those without Christ as being 'dead in trespasses and sins'. He said in verse 3 that they fulfil the desires of the flesh, and if anyone has lived long enough, he or she would have discovered that the desires of the flesh do not bring satisfaction. At the end of the day, what people need to gain the joy that they seek is to satisfy the burning desire to connect with their Maker, the Lord Jesus Christ. Until that is done, they will always feel empty. Cars, awards, titles, and all the money in this world can never fill that void in their hearts. Until they have a relationship with Christ, their lives will remain meaningless. This is why when people become born again, all of a sudden, they feel this inner peace that cannot be explained. What follows after is joy. Life now suddenly has a meaning. <br>Beloved, make Christ your top priority. Don't trade Him for money or anything else because it will profit you nothing if you gain the whole world and lose your soul (Matthew 16:26). People who do not have Christ will not only live a life of depression and chaos on earth, but they will also suffer for eternity in hell. The worst thing about hell is not the unquenchable fire and undying worms that will torture its occupants (Mark 9:48); it is the eternal separation from God and the regret of choosing to continue in sin despite hearing several messages of God's salvation. Save yourself from that torment by giving your life to Christ now if you haven't done so, and ensure you live holy henceforth. <br>NOTE: If you are born again, you can make this message into a tract.

The fellow who said that did not put God in the equation. With God, nothing is impossible. He can restore the unrestorable. You might have lost an opportunity in the past and now you think that it is impossible to regain that opportunity. However, there is nothing impossible with God. <br>In Ezekiel 37:1-11, God restored life to dry bones. God can restore that opportunity that you think is long gone to you if you have faith. He specialises in doing the impossible. <br>When I was studying at the University of Lagos, I applied to the Federal Ministry of Education for a scholarship to pursue a Master's degree. Time passed, and I never got a response from the ministry. Somehow, I raised the money for my tuition, and life went on. When I was close to obtaining the Master's degree, I met someone I used to know back when I was a games master in a secondary school. He was a games master at another school, and we had met when both of our schools were involved in a competition. As we talked, I found out that he now worked at the Federal Ministry of Education. I told him, “You people are very tough at the ministry. I applied for a scholarship, and I wasn't even called for an interview.” He told me that he would look into it. I thought I would get a letter asking me to come for an interview, but to my surprise, the letter I got was to tell me that I had been awarded the scholarship. Since I had already paid my tuition, I bought a land and built my first house with the money I was awarded. God used a casual meeting to restore an opportunity that I thought was long gone, and it led to me building my first house. <br>What you may have lost could be more serious. If you have lost your first love for Christ, and the passion and love that you had for Him at the beginning seems to have died, God will restore your love for Him today, in Jesus' name.

      "In continuing my teaching on the categories of prayer, I will focus on 'impossible' prayers today. The Bible\xa0says that some things are impossible with men, but with God, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26, Luke 1:37). If you have any doubt about this at all, just take a look at Redemption City, and you will know that with God, all things are possible. There are buildings in Redemption City that were built in seven days and which have been standing for around 40 years. The first secondary school building in the city is a two-storey building that was built in 18 days. I don't use human engineering, I use divine engineering because, with my God, nothing is impossible. <br>The moment God hears, “It can't be done” from your mouth, it just may never be done. This is because Numbers 14:28 says, “…<strong><em>as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:”</em></strong> Despite a fellow's unbelief, God's purpose will always be done, only that He will raise up another generation that will get the work done. In Numbers 13-14, twelve spies were sent to Jericho; ten of them came back and said that they couldn't take the land, while only two said they could. God ensured that all the people who said that they couldn't take the land were wiped out in the wilderness, while only the two who said that it was possible entered the land. In 2 Kings 7:1-17, Elisha proclaimed a seemingly impossible economic breakthrough within 24 hours. Everyone in the room kept quiet except one man who said that even if God created windows in heaven, it would be impossible. The breakthrough happened, but that man did not partake in it. Never say that anything is impossible; the moment someone says that something cannot be done, as far as he or she is concerned, it just may never be done. <br>When Jesus said in John 14:14, <strong><em>“If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it,” </em></strong>He was not joking. Therefore, if I ask for something that seems impossible, He will give it to me because He did not put any limit on what I can ask for according to His will (1 John 5:14-15). <br>Beloved, don't express doubt when it comes to God. Don't try to understand what He can do and how He will do it. Just believe.",

      "In continuation of my teaching on the categories of prayer, I will focus on dangerous prayers today. Some prayers are dangerous because what will follow if God answers them will be dangerous. This is because to whom much is given, much is required (Luke 12:48). <br>The prayer for God to anoint you and give you spiritual gifts is a dangerous prayer. The greater your anointing, the more visible you will be to the enemy. When you read Judges 15, you will see how powerful Samson was. However, in Judges 16, you will see how dangerous that power was. This is why I spend quality time praying for my children who are evangelists. I thank God for their lives and the miracles happening through them, but I also know that the anointing makes them very visible to the enemy, and they need to be protected. <br>The enemy is always after anointed people. In 2 Kings 1:7- 15, the king sent a total of 153 soldiers to arrest Elijah. However, in 2 Kings 6:8-16, when the king wanted to arrest Elisha, who had a double-portion anointing, he sent the entire army. There is a level of wealth and influence that, if you ask God for and He gives it to you, will have dangerous results. This is why sometimes, God holds some things back from some people, because He knows that they cannot handle them. Like Elisha, if you ask for a level of the anointing and God gives it to you, your tongue will not remain the same. With it, you can bless, and you can also kill. In 2 Kings 2:19-24, Elisha spoke, and the curse that had been on Jericho for generations vanished. Also, he decreed a curse on 42 unruly children, and they all died immediately. <br>It is good to ask for great things, but when you do, remember Numbers 20:1-12. Moses had led the Israelites for 40 years, he made only one mistake, and God said that he wouldn't go into the Promised Land because of it. This is why it is important to always pray for your leaders, especially your spiritual leaders. The power that they possess can both heal and kill. In Acts 5:1-11, Ananias and Sapphira sold a land, brought less than the amount they received to Peter, and that deception cost them their lives. <br>Power can bless, kill, heal, and make sick; be sure you can handle it before you ask for it. In 2 Kings 5:1-27, Naaman was cleansed by obeying an instruction from Elisha, and Gehazi became a leper by another word from the same mouth.",

      "Over the last three days, I have discussed very easy prayers and easy prayers. Today, I will talk about hard prayers. <br>You pray hard prayers when you ask God to change the natural order of things and negate the laid-down laws that govern the world. For example, when Joshua stopped the sun from setting, he prayed for something that was contrary to nature (Joshua 10:12-14). Also, in today's Bible text, King Hezekiah wanted the sun to go backwards as a sign that he would be healed. That was a hard prayer, but God did it still. If God answered these prayers by breaking the laws of nature just because someone asked Him to, then there is nothing that is too difficult to ask Him to do in your life. <br>Years ago, a pregnant woman came to me, saying that she already had daughters, but that her in-laws had threatened to chase her out of her husband's house if she didn't deliver a son with her current pregnancy. I told her that according to science, a baby's gender is decided within 72 hours after it is conceived. She replied that I was not the one who will change the gender of the baby; all she wanted was for me to agree with her in prayers. I did so, and she gave birth to a boy. You may say that the baby was probably a boy all along, however, I shared this testimony while preaching one day, and a woman came to meet me after the service. She was eight months pregnant and had done a scan which revealed that the baby in her womb was a boy. However, she wanted a girl because she wanted to be able to share her dresses with her daughter. I told her, “You know very well that this baby is fully formed by now.” She replied that I was not the one who will perform the miracle; she just wanted me to agree with her in prayers. I did so, and she gave birth to a girl! <br>Nothing is too hard for God to do (Jeremiah 32:27). He made the laws of nature and can suspend them at any time. He can reverse the irreversible just because you ask Him to. During one of our programmes, a man wanted to see the miracles happening at the altar and whispered to God that he would like to be taller. He outgrew his trousers on the spot and everyone could see it! Indeed, nothing is too hard for God to do.",

      "Today, I will continue my teaching on the various categories of prayer by looking at the second category: easy prayers. You pray easy prayers when you ask God for what He has already guaranteed in the Bible. For example, asking God for your daily bread is asking for something that He has already guaranteed (Matthew 6:9-11). The shepherd does not eat grass; it is meant for the sheep. So, when you ask God for food as His sheep, it is an easy prayer that He will answer easily (Psalms 23). <br>Psalms 35:27 says that God has pleasure in your prosperity. Therefore, asking for wealth is an easy prayer. Years ago, when I asked God for money to build a small house in Mushin, Lagos, He said, “Don't ask for a house, I have decided to give you a city.” So, when seven of us gathered in Ilorin to pray for a campground, one of us began to prophesy, “I have already provided the land, I will only show it to you.” The land was already provided because He guaranteed it in His word (Psalms 2:8). <br>One of my children said, 'Give me' is the prayer of a child. When your son comes to ask you for food, he is just saying, “I am ready for the next ration,” he is not bothered about the provision of the food. In the same vein, you should not be bothered about things that God has already promised you in the Scriptures. They are already provided for you, so all you need to do is ask, and you will get them at the right time. There is no need to worry about money, food, or all those things that make you comfortable; God has already provided them (Matthew 6:25-34). <br>When you worry about the things that God has guaranteed, it shows that you have little faith. Before you came to this world, He had prepared everything you need to survive. Just ask for them when you need them. As you ask, pay attention to whatever instructions He will give you on how to get them. In 1 Kings 17:4-6, He told Elijah to go to the brook and food was brought to him there. If Elijah did not obey, he would have died of hunger even though food was available for him. Your well-being is God's responsibility; stop worrying about it.",

      "Yesterday, I taught about praise and worship being in the category of very easy prayers and the fact that even little children can praise God. Today, I will discuss God's reaction to very easy prayers. <br>The first thing you must know about this category of prayers is that God is looking for people that pray this way. Students seek knowledge, politicians seek power, businessmen seek profit, but God seeks worshippers. He is constantly searching for people that will worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24). When He finds such people, He is so happy that He gives them blessings and miracles that they did not even ask for. Psalms 67:5-6 says: <br><strong><em>Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.</em></strong> <br>When we had just begun to hold the Holy Ghost Service at Redemption City, I was fasting and praying towards the programme one day when God said, “Don't pray, just praise Me.” I did that, and the way He responded amazed me. On the first night of the Holy Ghost Service, He healed 14,000 people. We were few then, so that was almost everyone in attendance! After the programme, I was in my prayer room, thanking Him because I had not seen such before. Then, He told me to praise Him more and that He would do more the next day. I did not understand what He was saying because almost everyone had been healed on the first day. What I did not know was that the people who had gotten their healing went to tell their friends, and more people came the following day. On that day, 16,000 people were healed! I became frightened. Imagine having a congregation of 15,000 people, and by the next day, it had grown to 30,000! Praising and worshipping God causes Him to do frightening miracles. <br>A few years ago, during a wedding ceremony in a parish of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, the groom suddenly fell and died while signing the marriage register. All the pastors gathered and prayed all the prayers they knew, yet the young man's corpse grew colder. Then, someone said that they should all stop praying and just praise God. Not long after they started doing that, the groom rose from the dead. <br>Beloved, the easiest route to getting God to pay attention to you is through praise and worship. Do it continuously.",

      "There are five categories of prayers: very easy prayers,\xa0easy prayers, hard prayers, dangerous prayers, and 'impossible' prayers. For the next few days, I will be teaching on each of them to help you have a more robust prayer life. <br>The first category of prayers is the very easy prayers. This is praise and worship. Praise and worship is very easy because you don't have to be a theologian to praise God; even little children can praise Him (Matthew 21:15-16). <br>David said that his soul would not forget all of God's benefits, and so he would bless the Lord (Psalms 103:2). As a songwriter said, if you count your blessings and name them one by one, it will be very easy to praise God. David said, <strong><em>“I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth.” </em></strong>(Psalms 34:1). You can praise God non-stop because praising Him is very easy when you count your blessings. It is very easy to do, yet it is extremely powerful. Unfortunately, many Christians don't praise God much. <br>When we were about to open the first parish of The Redeemed Christian Church of God in Abuja, I was in my hotel room, praying concerning the programme that would hold that evening and asking God to perform miracles, heal the sick, and save souls. While praying, God said, “Shut up, am I your houseboy? Have you thanked Me for all I've done for you in the past?” I said, “Oh Lord, thank You for all You have done in the past. Tonight, please heal the sick…” Again, He told me to shut up and that I should only praise Him and not ask for anything for the next three days. It was very difficult, but I did it anyway. By the end of the third day, He said, “Select elders who will be going around, teaching the doctrine of the church to strengthen its foundation because all you have seen thus far is addition; get ready for multiplication.” The result of praising Him then can be clearly seen today as RCCG has indeed multiplied greatly. <br>Do you engage in this very easy prayer of praise and worship? How often do you praise God? Look around you, there are multitudes of things you can praise God for; praise Him continually for them. I know there are some things that you wish He has done, but what about all He has done already? If you find it difficult to praise God for what He has done, how do you expect Him to do more? <br>Don't be an ingrate; go ahead and praise God with all your might.",

      "Some people do not want to grow old; it is as if they are seeking the 'fountain of youth' that can keep them young forever. While it is impossible to remain young forever, you can still have the strength and vigour of a youth no matter how old you become. <br>I told some friends sometime ago that since Joel 2:28 says that young men see visions, if you still have visions that you are pursuing, you are young. God will give you visions when you wait on Him in His presence (Habakkuk 2:1-2). Those who spend quality time with God are visionaries; they come out of His presence loaded with visions that they want to accomplish. Before I became born again, my biggest vision was to be the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa, but after I got saved and started spending time with God, I began to have bigger visions. <br>There is always a transfer from God to you when you spend quality time with Him. In Exodus 34:30-35, when Moses returned after he had been with God, the Israelites could not look at his face because God's glory was all over him. Moses spent quality time with God; he once went to a mountain and stayed there with God for 40 days (Exodus 24:18). No wonder when he was 120 years old, his strength had not reduced, and his eyes were still very sharp (Deuteronomy 34:7). Abraham was over 80 years old when he went to war to rescue his nephew, Lot (Genesis 14:13-16). He could do so because he was a man of altars, always spending time with God. Spending quality time with God keeps you strong and youthful. With the little sleep that I often get because of my tight schedules, I should be looking older than my age, but by God’s grace, I am still strong enough at 82 to go on long walks, and my eyes are not dim. It is not because I am special; it is because I am always in contact with God's glory in His presence. <br>Beloved, you can retain the vitality of youth even until your old age by being addicted to His presence. However, you shouldn't live an unhealthy lifestyle and expect God to keep you young because you spend hours in His presence.

Gluttons cannot control their appetites, and such people do not usually go far in life. They simply want to eat every time; food has become their preoccupation – their god. <br>Controlling your appetite is very important, and this is why the Bible says: <br><strong><em>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. </em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProverbs 23:1-2 <br>The Scripture above does not imply that believers should literally put a knife to their necks, rather, it is saying that if they cannot control their appetite, even if they sit at a table with great men, they will still bring about their own destruction. The Bible tells us that even though Daniel and his friends were chosen amongst those to eat a portion of the king's food, they controlled their appetites and chose not to defile themselves with the food. They chose to honour God by controlling their appetites, and God honoured them in return (Daniel 1:1-21). <br>Esau's destiny was destroyed with a bowl of porridge; just one bowl of food caused his name to be omitted from the list we usually talk about – the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ‘Jacob’ on the list would have been Esau, but he couldn’t control his appetite and lost his place on that great list (Genesis 25:29-34). <br>Some adults eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, snack in-between meals, and eat again just before going to bed. How can you have the strength to wake up in the middle of the night for spiritual warfare when you are so loaded with food that you can hardly stand? There are many people who died untimely deaths and truncated their own destinies because of how much food they ate. They ate to the point of endangering their health, and then they passed on. Don't let this be your portion. <br>Beloved, you should eat only when necessary and eat only the quantity of food that you need to survive. When you eat too much, you will be weak, and you will have less strength to do the things that you need to do to achieve greatness.

      "Today, I will continue my teaching on the different vices that can destroy destinies. When we first started building Redemption City, I knew some bricklayers who would have been very wealthy by now if only they had not been lazy. God had set them up in a place where they could have had great success, but their laziness robbed them of that opportunity. <br>Beloved, don't be lazy. When I meet some pastors who started about the same time as me, they will usually say, “God has been good to you.” Truly, God has been really gracious to me, but then, nobody can accuse me of laziness. God can supply you with the grace you need to fulfil your destiny, but if you are lazy, the grace He provided will go to waste because you will not use it. Many have prayed for open doors, but when the door was opened before them, they did not walk into it because of their laziness. <br>In today's Bible reading, we are told to learn from the ants as they provide their meat and gather their harvest at the right time. These days, some people make excuses to hide their laziness using different terms like exhaustion, procrastination, and so on. When a fellow constantly disregards the things that he or she ought to do when they ought to be done, it is simply laziness. For instance, if someone is to go out at 8am, but decides to stay in bed and refuses to have a bath nor get his or her clothes ironed by 7:30am, that is laziness. <br>When you read Proverbs 24:30-34, you will see the major danger in laziness. Laziness does not destroy destinies suddenly, it does it little by little. If you are lazy, you will look back at your life after a while, and you will realise that you are far from the things that you set out to achieve. <br>Beloved, please banish any form of laziness in your life. The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 9:11 that time and chance happen to everyone. If you are lazy, when your time and chance come, you will likely be in bed sleeping. Don't allow a little sleep to destroy your destiny. Good sleep is very important for your health and general well-being, however, do not oversleep or sleep when you ought to be working. <br>Get up and work!

Another means through which the devil destroys destinies is greed. 1 Timothy 6:10 says: <br><strong><em>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. </em></strong><br>Once the devil can get someone to love money, other evils will begin to spring forth. Money should not have dominion over you; don't make decisions that you know will offend God solely because of money. Anything that is against the will of God, even if it has benefits worth billions of dollars attached to it, must become a taboo to you. Many people have stolen money to buy a car, and then that car became their coffin. <br>Gehazi had a great destiny ahead of him; he could have inherited a double portion of the double-portion anointing that Elisha had, and that would have given him tremendous power. However, greed denied him of a great destiny. No matter how much money a Christian is tempted to steal, God's plan for his or her life is much bigger than it. I have seen great destinies destroyed because the people involved were too much in a hurry to become rich, and so, they took what they ought not to take. Proverbs 28:20 says: <br><strong><em>A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. </em></strong><br>Don't be too much in a hurry to be rich.

      "The devil is always looking for signs that mark out people of great destinies. You may have noticed long ago that you are not in this world to be ordinary, and that there is a great destiny that God has ordained for you. The devil may also sense this, and even though he is unable to fully understand it, he will begin to send destiny destroyers to the fellow to ensure that he or she does not fulfil that glorious destiny. One major destiny destroyer the devil tries to use is illicit sex. <br>In Genesis 37:5-9, the devil heard Joseph talk about his destiny and marked him for destruction. He tried to get his brothers to kill him, but they ended up selling him into slavery. The devil thought that Joseph would not fulfil his dreams in slavery, but when he saw how he prospered in Potiphar's house even as a slave, he knew that the only way he could stop him was to tempt him with illicit sex, so he sent Potiphar's wife to seduce him (Genesis 39:11-12). Thankfully, Joseph did not fall for the temptation because that would have been the end of his big dreams and destiny. Every time you are tempted to engage in illicit sex, that is the devil trying to destroy your destiny. Your response will determine if you will still fulfil destiny or not. <br>No matter how great a person's destiny is, giving room to fornication or adultery will destroy such a fellow because the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 that our bodies are God's temple, and if a fellow defiles God's temple, he or she will be destroyed. Samson was really great and powerful, so much so that he could single-handedly defeat an entire army. However, as powerful as he was, he met his defeat in the laps of a woman that he wasn't married to. Before long, he was grinding corn for his enemies (Judges 16:21). <br>If you find out that you are having illicit sexual desires towards someone of the opposite sex, you should run to God for mercy, go on a fast, and pray for those desires to die. This way, you will strengthen yourself enough to avoid falling into the temptation and those illicit sexual desires will die eventually. <br>Beloved, guard yourself against the devil's temptations to engage in sexual immorality. Don't allow him to make you destroy your destiny with your own hands. Resist him, and he will flee from you (James 4:7).",

      "Prayer is one of the greatest weapons that God gave to man; the ability to call on Him anytime we want and have Him answer us. It is a signed blank cheque to His children. The question now is, how come some Christians don't use this blank cheque? The answer is in Psalms 10:4: <br><strong><em>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. </em></strong><br>Christians that do not pray are proud; it means that they do not have God in all their thoughts because they think they are smart enough to solve all their problems. 1 Corinthians 1:25 says that no matter how wise you are, the things of God that may appear foolish far exceed human wisdom, and the things that seem weak far exceed human strength. It is foolishness not to pray. <br>One day, when I was a child, I was playing football in front of our house. At a point, I kicked the ball to the top of the roof, and it got stuck there. I was little, so I couldn't see the ball. I tried using a stick to get the ball down from the roof, but I was not able to. My dad was sitting close by, but I didn't call him for help. At last, when I was tired, I asked for his help, and he said, “You saw me here all this while, but you didn't think to ask for my help.” He stood up and, with one sweep of his hand, brought the ball down. I thought I could bring the ball down by myself, and I kept stressing myself to do so even though I could have just asked my dad for help and gotten the ball easily. Many people stress themselves unnecessarily, running from pillar to post in search of solutions to problems that can easily be solved on their knees in prayers to God. <br>God gave you a blank cheque in Jeremiah 33:3: <br><strong><em>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. </em></strong><br>I have been using my blank cheque at every opportunity, and God has been answering and showing me great and mighty things that I did not know.

      "Today, I will conclude my teaching on what it means to be a true helpmeet. There are wives who parade themselves as helpmeets, but they are not. As a wife, if you hide money, saying, “My money is my money, and my husband's money is our money,” you are not a helpmeet. To help someone, you must be willing to sacrifice your resources. You cannot claim to be helping when you do not meet needs that you can easily afford to. Yes, it is a husband's responsibility to take care of the home, but whenever you can afford it, it will be very helpful to say, “Don't worry about this, I have taken care of it.” Helping someone entails taking burdens off the person and not watching him or her carry them alone. <br>As a helpmeet, you must be fully involved in what your husband does; be there to help him in areas he needs help, especially when he asks for it. You cannot be a helpmeet if you are not submissive. If you are to help someone with something, they will give you instructions on how to help them. When they give you instructions, your answer should be, “Yes, darling.” If you say “No”, you are clearly not willing to help. If you want to suggest a better idea, your answer should be, “How about we do it this way?” as opposed to an outright “No.” If you are truly interested in your husband's success, you will do all you can to help him. <br>When I moved my family to Redemption City, it was not convenient for my wife. We moved from a city to the middle of a forest, and the house we moved into had no windows – this is where the Open Heavens International Centre is today. Not only did my wife move into such inconvenience, but she also began rigorous rural evangelism in the surrounding areas. She gathered a small team to help her and would travel to many villages several kilometres away, preaching the gospel. Some people didn't want to hear about Christ, while some said that they were already part of bigger church denominations. However, she persisted and was able to establish most of the parishes we have around the city today, even all the way to Ibafo, which is about 20 kilometres away. She is a perfect example of a helpmeet, one that gets involved and does everything in her power to see her husband succeed.",

      "When God instituted marriage in Genesis 2, He made the woman to be the helpmeet for the man. In other words, the woman is to help the man in doing what God has called him to do. However, for one reason or the other, some women are not real helpmeets to their husbands, and this causes problems in their homes. <br>First, a woman cannot help her husband beyond her capacity to help. For example, if a husband is a businessman that earns millions, he should raise his wife to the level where she earns hundreds of thousands at least. At that level, she will probably understand his business more and help him better. However, if she is earning below that, when there is a need for her to help, she may be unable to do so significantly, even though she is willing to help. As a pastor, if you can pray for six hours at a stretch, train your wife to be able to pray for at least four hours. This way, the day you need prayers, she can stand in the gap for you at a reasonable level. If you cannot send your wife to preach on your behalf at a meeting that you are unable to attend, you have not been training her, and she has not developed what it takes to be your helpmeet (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10). <br>Your helpmeet is supposed to be there to lift you up when you are down. However, the strength of your helpmeet will determine how well they can lift you in your down seasons. As a husband, if something terrible happens and you fall, you will fall to the level of your wife. She can only catch you at the level at which she is standing financially, spiritually or otherwise. Therefore, if you don't lift her to your level or at least close to your level, your fall will be great in such seasons because you will only be able to depend on her resources to stay afloat until you start rising again. As a husband, you should endeavour to empower your wife to become a helpmeet to you indeed.",

      "The Bible says that husbands are to love their wives as Christ loved the church (Ephesians 5:25). This analogy alone is enough to tell us straightaway that love is not an emotion or feeling, but a decision to consistently act in the best interest of your spouse. In other words, the best interest of your spouse should become a priority to you. <br>In Luke 22:42, Jesus did not feel like dying for the church. He tried to convince God to let the impending suffering and death pass over Him. He prayed so hard that His sweat was like blood, but what had to be done, had to be done. He went to the cross, suffered shame, pain, and death for the ones He loved. That is what husbands are to do for their wives; love them as Christ loves the church and gave Himself for her. Husband, can you do this for your wife? <br>When I see Christian husbands buying new clothes and shoes for themselves while their wives wear old, worn out clothes, I wonder if they even read their Bibles at all. Worse still are the men who beat their wives. As a husband, if you love your wife, you will take good care of her and put her interests above yours. Money will be too small to sacrifice to make her happy. In Nigeria, men of the Igbo tribe are renowned for truly caring for their wives. In Igbo land, any man that beats his wife or does not take care of her is called an Efulefu. An Efulefu is someone who is way below useless, empty, and who has nothing good to offer. This is a generally held belief among people who are not all believers, how much more Christians who have been directed by God to take care of their wives and families (1 Timothy 5:8). <br><strong><em>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. </em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEphesians 5:28 <br>The Scripture above instructs husbands to love their wives as they love their own bodies. Just as they eat good food, put on good clothes, and do not allow any harm to come to their bodies, they are to treat their wives the same way. As a husband, you should use the best of your resources, words, and actions to show your wife that you love her. When you do this, you are a good husband indeed, and one advantage that a good husband has, according to today's memory verse, is that God hears his prayers.",

      "Marriage is a beautiful gift from God; it is designed to bring joy and fulfilment to both partners. Like every other gift from God, it comes with a manual – the word of God. In today's Bible reading, there is a detailed description of how a husband and wife should relate with each other. Husbands are to love their wives as Christ loves the church, while wives are to submit to their husbands. <br>Many women don't understand what submission really means. They say they are submissive, whereas they are only cooperative. Cooperation is agreeing with your husband because you want the same things. Submission, however, is complying with his wish even when you don't agree. Many women find it difficult to submit to their husbands because the society talks about gender equality. However, this is not what the Bible says about marriage. <br>Submission does not mean slavery or servitude, rather, it is a voluntary act of respect and obedience from a wife to her husband as the head of the home. When you obey your boss in the office, it is not because you are a slave, it is because there is a hierarchy that must be followed for things to go smoothly in the office. An English proverb says that two captains cannot sail a ship. As a wife, your husband is the captain of your marriage-ship; submitting to him is a key ingredient in ensuring that you have a blissful marriage. <br>Years ago, I used to preach regularly at a university, and a woman would usually come to me complaining about her husband's stubbornness and asking me to pray the stubbornness away. After a while, I decided I wasn't going to pray anymore. I told her, “When you get home, place his food on the dining table, call him your head, and ask him to come and eat. When he sits at the table, give him a bowl of water, kneel and let him wash his hands in it.” She said, “No way! He is a professor just like I am. We are the same.” I replied that if she wanted my help, she should take my advice. She decided to do it, and at first, her husband wondered if she had poisoned the food. She told him that her pastor taught her what she was doing, and suddenly, the stubborn husband became very soft. He followed her to the next service and became born again. Their marriage blossomed thereafter.",

Some of them don't even play with their spouses anymore.

The waiting goes on for different things at different times. <br>Waiting is inevitable for everyone, however, what you do while waiting is more important than what you are waiting for itself. When people lose their patience with God and decide to do things outside His will to stop their waiting season, they often regret it. <br>In 1 Samuel 13:8-14, Saul got tired of waiting for Samuel's arrival to perform a sacrifice, so he decided to perform the sacrifice himself, which was against the will of God. That action resulted in him losing his throne. In Genesis 16:1-3, Sarah got tired of waiting on God for a child, so she gave Hagar to Abraham as a wife.

Finding alternatives to God in order to shorten a waiting season always ends in regrets. My wife and I were praying for a woman to conceive.

A true prophecy is an echo of what God has said. <br>When I was younger in ministry, I recall prophesying that a particular airline will never suffer loss because I was excited over their services to the church. I prophesied based on my feelings without hearing what God had to say. Not long after, the airline suffered a plane crash.

I learnt my lesson from that – if God has not spoken, I do not prophesy. <br>Beloved, don't be too much in a hurry to say 'God said' when God didn't say anything. Don't allow pride to push you to prophesy; prophesy only according to the will of God. Push pride aside so that you can hear God clearly. Long before the Nigerian elections in 2023, people were agitated as to who will become the next president. They put pressure on me to tell them what the outcome of the elections will be.

Until God speaks, I won't say anything.” You must become comfortable with keeping quiet when God is quiet. If you are truly His mouthpiece, when His mouth is shut, yours will be also. <br>Prophecy must also be in line with the word of God. If a prophecy does not echo the word of God in the Scriptures, it is false. A man came to me and said, “I heard that you are a prophet, and anything you say comes to pass. Can you tell me my future?” I responded, “That is easy. Are you born again?” He said, “No”. “Then, your future will be terrible,” I responded. He asked, “How do you know?

This was a man who used an ordinary stone to bring down a giant that had terrorised his country for 40 days and nights (1 Samuel 17). As humans, we have the tendency to believe that we are strong and that we are in control, whereas, God is the One that upholds us (Isaiah 41:8-10). <br>In Daniel 4:30, Nebuchadnezzar was boasting of his really great achievements, but within that same hour, he was on all fours, eating grass with the beasts of the field (Daniel 4:31-33).

King Herod thought that he was powerful and could capture and kill whoever he wanted to (Mark 6:16-17), but right in front of his people, he was eaten up by ordinary maggots (Acts 12:23). When God wants to show that He is in control, He can use ants to bring down an elephant. This is why you will always see me being humble, kneeling to worship God in public, and surrendering my all to Him. I know what I am doing because I know that without Him, I am nothing.

He explained to me how a Boy-Scouts-like group had evolved into this new agency, and that he was sourcing for who would lead the group spiritually. Normally, I ask God before getting involved in anything at all, but this time, my love for the military in my younger days beclouded my best instincts, and l agreed to be their head. He told me that they needed some funding, which I gave as the prospective head. However, I later found out that the man was a fake. My desire to be part of a paramilitary group made me run ahead of God, but God had already purposed for Redemption City to have its own corps of chaplains as well as a local Police post.

      "There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that\xa0is committed to God that does not turn out well. This is why you must commit things into God's hands and let Him take the lead in everything that you do. Ask Him for counsel before you make any move, and everything will go well. <br>My Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, exemplified committing things into God's hands. He placed the church in God's hands right from its outset. He did not just commit the church into God's hands in prayers, he also did so in actions. He did exactly everything that God asked Him to do as regards the church, and in turn, God fulfilled His promises concerning the church. Many people think that The Redeemed Christian Church of God is what it is today because of me; that is not true. God already decided the destiny of the church long before I became born again. If I had refused to obey Him, He would have gotten someone else to become the General Overseer. Whatever is committed into God's hands can never go wrong. <br>If you really want to be successful, place all your plans in the hands of God. Proverbs 3:5 says: <br><strong><em>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. </em></strong><br>Don't depend on your degrees, skills, connections, or money; depend on God alone. Trust Him with all your heart, do everything according to His word, obey all His instructions, and you will see Him do great things for you. Make it clear to God that He is the owner of your career, business, ministry, and every other aspect of your life, and He will make sure that you have all-round success. <br>You must note, however, that when you commit something to God, you are agreeing to Him becoming your senior partner. This means that when He gives you instructions, you must obey. Some of these instructions may not make sense to you, and some may be very difficult for you to do, but if you don't take the control back from Him, and if you submit to His leadership, you will enjoy greater success than you could ever have had all by yourself.",

Rather, people, based on their behaviour toward God and His instructions, choose for themselves if they will be unto honour or unto dishonour. <br>There are many people who say that since God is merciful, and His mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22- 23), they can commit sin multiple times and ask Him for mercy multiple times. Therefore, they commit sin purposely, trusting that when they ask for mercy, God will have mercy. Some even say things like, “God, forgive me for what I am about to say.” They know it is a sin, but they ask for forgiveness and go ahead to say it. People like this are trying to make a fool out of the Most High God and will become vessels unto dishonour if they do not repent. The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Even if a Christian gives a big sacrifice or worships God deeply, if his or her heart is still in a sinful state, the wages of sin remain death. <br>In today's Bible reading, God told Saul to kill all the Amalekites, but he decided to play on God's intelligence by saying that it was the people who brought the king of Amalek and the choice animals back with them to Israel. We see the result of the disobedience in 1 Samuel 15:28: <br><strong><em>And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. </em></strong><br>Saul begged Samuel to let him worship God, but it was not out of true repentance. He only did that because he did not want to be embarrassed in the presence of his followers. In the next chapter, you will see that as much as Samuel pleaded on his behalf, God still asked him to anoint a new king as his replacement. God later sent an evil spirit to torment Saul, as he had become a vessel unto dishonour. <br>Beloved, be careful. Don't toy with sin, and don't try to play on God's intelligence so that you don't end up like Saul.",

      "When God gives a commandment, many people think that it is for His own good, whereas every commandment that He gives is for our good. When you disobey God, you are actually hurting yourself; He remains God whether you obey Him or not. Those who choose to disobey God are the ones that are actually losing, not God. <br>When God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him, it was not because He wanted to eat the boy for breakfast; it was because He wanted Abraham's obedience to open the door to irreversible blessings for him and his seed. If Abraham had disobeyed, he would have missed out on such a great blessing. When Elisha told Naaman to go and wash in the river Jordan, it was not because he wanted to humiliate him, it was because he wanted him to be healed of leprosy. Naaman almost missed his healing because of his pride. If he had not gone to wash, Elisha would not have lost anything, but Naaman would have died a leper. When God gives you an instruction, no matter how difficult it seems, you stand to gain a lot more from obeying it. <br>God gave man a special gift, and that is free will. This free will is one of the things that makes us more special than all His other creations. You can decide to obey or disobey Him if you want. However, to justify any blessing that He wants to give to you, He wants you to obey Him out of your free will. If you disobey His instruction, you are using your free will against Him, and that will disqualify you from receiving the blessings that are attached to the instruction. When God sent Elijah to the widow of Zarephath for food, he told the woman to give him her last meal. It was not Elijah who needed a miracle; God had already been feeding him supernaturally up until that time. God wanted to test the widow to see if she would use her free will for herself or Him. She passed the test, and in return, she had more than enough food to last her through the famine. Also, when her son died in 1 Kings 17:17-22, because she had obeyed God, Elijah was there to bring him back to life. <br>Beloved, obeying God is always for your good.",

      "Today's teaching may be controversial to some people, but I will share the complete truth anyway. When there is an opportunity to serve God through a prophet that you are sure is sent by Him, no matter how small the service may be, don’t let the opportunity pass you by. When you serve or give to a prophet, because of God's anointing on his or her life, you will receive a blessing from God. <br>I went to a foreign country for a programme, and throughout my stay, a very rich man drove me around. When he dropped me off at the airport, I wanted to show my appreciation, but since he was richer than me, I put some money in an envelope and said, “Please give it to your children on my behalf.” He collected the money and said, “Amen” several times. I became embarrassed, and I turned to the other pastor who came with us. The pastor said, “He has been waiting on God for the fruit of the womb.” On hearing that, I said, “Glory be to God, I don't have money, but I am connected to the Most High God.” The following year, when I arrived in that country for another edition of the same programme, the man came to drive me again. This time, he had a gift with him and said that it was from his son. You might have prayed for certain things and not received them yet, but offering your service to God through a prophet could bring them to you immediately. <br>When you check through the Scriptures, you will see that those who served prophets genuinely got great rewards for their service. Samuel became a kingmaker and king\x02remover because he served Eli. Elisha got a double portion of the anointing because he served Elijah diligently. The Shunammite woman got a child even when she had lost hope because she served Elisha. Whenever you get a chance to serve God through one of His ministers, make the most of the opportunity. <br>Ministers of God, however, should not take anyone’s willingness to serve God through them for granted. God shows appreciation to those that serve Him, and His ministers ought to do the same. However, if you are serving God through one of His ministers and it seems like you are not being appreciated, as long as you are sure that he or she is a genuine minister of God, you will surely receive the rewards of your service from God.",

      "Sometimes, God gives prophecies that sound impossible to the human mind and this makes some people doubt and miss out on them. When a prophecy seems too good to be true or difficult to believe, just keep quiet. Don't say anything against the prophecy because if you do, you may never see it fulfilled. In today's Bible reading, the minister voiced his unbelief in Elisha's prophecy. The prophecy came to pass, but because of what he said, he did not live to experience it. <br>What we say and/or do after receiving a prophecy matters. God told Abraham in Genesis 17:4 and Genesis 26:3-4 that he would be a father of nations and that his children would be as many as the stars in the sky. At that time, he and his wife were already old and did not have any children. Even though Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6), the prophecy was not fulfilled immediately. When it appeared as if the prophecy was not going to come to pass, Sarah got Abraham to have a child with Hagar, her handmaiden. Despite this, God told him in Genesis 17:1 to walk before Him and be perfect and repeated the prophecy. This time, Abraham doubted in his heart (Genesis 17:17), but he did not speak out, nor did he try another alternative outside God's will. God instructed him to circumcise all the males in his house as a sign of His covenant with him, and Abraham obeyed. Although he doubted God in his heart, his words and actions did not express it. Later, in Genesis 18, God appeared to him, and nine months after, Isaac was born. If your mouth and actions don't negate God's promises for you, no matter how unbelievable those promises sound, you will see them come to pass. <br>When God tells me something unbelievable, I immediately begin to repeat it to those He permits me to share it with. I don't give room for my human mind to process it and express doubts. I confess the prophecy repeatedly so that it becomes real to me. When God told me that He would build me a city, I could not even afford to build a small house, but I announced it to everyone who cared to hear. Today, He has fulfilled that prophecy. When He showed me trailers bringing in cows to feed the crowds that will be attending our programmes, I announced it to people, even though we did not have money to buy half a dozen cows. Today, that prophecy has been fulfilled as well.",

      "Yesterday, I talked about rejecting negative\xa0prophecies from false prophets. However, sometimes, a real prophet can prophesy something that you are not comfortable with. God sometimes tells us things just for our information; at other times, it is so that we can do something about them. How then do you reverse negative prophecies if you receive them? <br>Like Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20:1-11, the first thing you can do is to cry to God to reverse the prophecy. If He listens, He will send the same prophet back to you with a new prophecy. Secondly, you can get a prophet with a higher anointing to cancel the negative prophecy. This is what the people of Jericho did in today's Bible reading. Joshua had placed a curse on the land, but Elisha was able to cancel the decree that Joshua made because he had a double portion of the anointing. <br>Years ago, a man told me that he met a prophet when he was 44 years old who told him all that would happen to him for the next 40 years and that he would die at 84. He said that everything the prophet told him had come to pass, and it was now two weeks to his 84th birthday. I asked if he wanted to serve God, and he said, “Yes,” so I told him that he will live. He insisted that everything the prophet told him had come to pass, but as a higher prophet, I replied that as long as he was willing to serve God, he would live until he was ready to die. A few weeks before his 100th birthday, he sent for me and said that he was ready to go; he died a few days before turning 100. <br>Sometimes, negative prophecies can come to you directly from God, either in a dream, trance, or even in an audible voice. In such instances, you can meet a prophet who is closer to God than you and ask him to help you plead with God to change it. Years ago, a wealthy man, who had just given his life to Christ and had been of tremendous help to me in fulfilling God's work, had a dream where God told him to put his house in order because it was time for him to be called home. He came to me, and I said, “No!” I told him, “Don't worry, I will discuss it with my Daddy.” I told God, “Lord, I still need this man here, please don't take him yet.” God answered me, and the man lived.",

When a negative prophecy is from a prophet who genuinely hears from God, the fellow involved can cry to God like Hezekiah did in 2 Kings 20:1-11, and God can decide to change it. Tomorrow, I will discuss more about what you can do concerning negative prophecies but the discussion today will be centred on false prophecies. <br>We don’t have many accounts of false prophets in the Bible because God said in Ezekiel 13:9 that they will not be in the assembly of Israel or written about in the books of Israel. These days, false prophets try to plant fear in people with their prophecies. If these people allow fear to take root in their hearts, they have given those prophecies the power and permission they need to be accomplished. This is because what a person fears is likely to come upon him or her (Job 3:25-26). As a Christian, when such prophecies come your way, don't allow fear into your heart; God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Rather than being afraid, meditate on the word of God that negates the false prophecy and pray to God about it. Many false prophets have told me, “Thus saith the Lord.” However, God would always tell me, “Don't mind that fellow; that message is not from Me.” <br>Not long after the great Archbishop Benson Idahosa went to be with the Lord, some investors opened a bank and invited me to pray before they commenced operations. After praying, they asked me to open an account with them so that I will be their first customer. I told them that I didn't have money to open the account, so they opened it for me with N50,000 of their money. Shortly after that, some newspapers reported that I had started a bank with N50,000,000; the news was everywhere. We had a meeting of Pentecostal pastors in Nigeria just after that, and one 'prophet', misled by the newspaper reports, prophesied that I would soon be called home just like the archbishop. Others at the meeting urged me to react, but I stayed quiet because I know what the word of God says about my life. The man who made that prophecy is no more today, and I am still here by God's grace.",

This brings up the question, is marriage a blessing or a curse? <br>Some people argue that marriage is a curse because if Eve was not created, and marriage was not instituted in the first place, there would be no sin in the world. Adam also seemed to believe this theory because he blamed God for giving him Eve when he was asked why he ate the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:12). However, we must remember that Adam was alone, and God created Eve for his good. Everything was going well until sin came in. So, Eve was not the problem, the problem was sin. <br>Marriage can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on what either of the couple allows into their union. If marriage is done in line with God's word, it will be a blessing. However, if either of the couple goes outside the will of God and lets sin in, there will be trouble. Today makes it 57 years since I have been married, and I can tell you without a doubt that my marriage became a blessing when my wife and I gave our lives to Christ and started living according to His will. Before then, we would have disagreements that would last for weeks, but these stopped when we surrendered to Christ. <br>I recall the story of a couple who fought every single night. One day, someone invited them to a RCCG parish in their city, and when an altar call was made, they gave their lives to Christ. Over the next three weeks, their neighbours didn't hear them fighting. Curious, the neighbours asked the couple why they had not been fighting. They replied that they had brought Christ into their marriage, and He was the reason they stopped fighting. If your marriage is to be a blessing, you and your spouse must truly be born again, living according to God's word. You and your spouse should study the Bible, pray, and evangelise together. You should both be on fire for God. When you do these regularly, you will discover how beautiful marriage is. I am enjoying my marriage, and I pray that you will enjoy yours too, in Jesus’ name.",

If no one can hide sins from God, it means no one can avoid the consequences of sins.

He is fulfilling destiny because of the exalted position that he has attained,” but if Joseph did not save his family from the famine as God had created him to do (Genesis 45:1-11), he would have been a failure.

      "Many Christians take people's love and loyalty for Mgranted. When a brother or sister in Christ loves you, be careful not to disappoint them because if you do, and the fellow is offended, they may never regain the love they had for you. If someone is willing to make sacrifices for you, take that as a challenge for you to also make sacrifices for them. When they are loyal to you, you must also be loyal to them. The closer someone is to you, the more careful you must be not to offend them. <br>Many ministers of God feel that because they are the head of a ministry, they can do whatever they like without caring about the people that love them. For some, the moment they become popular, they begin to take those who started out with them for granted. Many sworn enemies today are people who were close friends yesterday. There is an English proverb that says, “Make new friends and keep the old; one is silver, the other is gold.” Old friends are gold; they knew and loved you when you were nothing. As years pass by, your new friends will also start turning to gold. You can keep making new friends but keep the old ones. <br>One thing that has helped us in RCCG is that everyone who laboured with us when we were still very small is honoured and appreciated. This way, the younger ones see that if they work hard, they will not be neglected. <br>The worst enemy anyone can have is the enemy within his or her household. An enemy that goes in and out with someone is very dangerous. Believers must be careful not to offend their brothers and turn them into enemies; they are likely to suffer greatly for it. When you notice that there is something that may offend your brother, call him aside and discuss it with him. Matthew 5:23-24 says that when you go to God with an offering, and you remember that a brother has something against you, you are to leave your offering there and seek to reconcile with that brother before you come back to give the offering. Note that the Bible does not say, “If you have something against the brother,” but, “If the brother has something against you.” Don't put a stumbling block between yourself and God. The Bible says in Romans 12:18, <strong><em>“If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”</em></strong> <br>As much as it may be in your power, live in peace with everyone around you.",

      "These days, many Christians look for ways to water down certain doctrines and prove that they are useless. When the doctrine of their Bible-believing church dictates that they should not dress in a certain way, for example, they go about looking for Hebrew and Greek interpretations of Scriptures to say that the doctrine is useless – this is not right. Doctrines are a major part of your Christian walk. Although they can sometimes appear to be tough to live by, they are codes of conduct that will keep you consecrated. A doctrine may not seem interesting when you are living by it, but if you keep doing so, over time, you will realise that it has helped you to stay strong in the faith. <br>God is always solidly behind doctrines. In fact, 2 Timothy 3:16 says that one of the reasons God gave us Scriptures is so that we can get doctrines from them: <br><strong><em>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</em></strong> <br>You must note, however, that doctrines are gotten from the Scriptures by the representative of God in the leadership of a denomination. The head of another denomination may not develop a doctrine from that same Scripture, but as long as the fellow whom you call your Father in the Lord develops a doctrine from a Scripture, you have to live by it. The early Church was strong with very fervent Christians because they continued steadfastly in the doctrines of their leaders, the Apostles, as we see in Acts 2:42: <br><strong><em>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</em></strong> <br>Note that you are not to choose which doctrine to follow based on convenience but based on your conviction that the one who brought the doctrine developed it from the Scriptures. You should also be convinced that the person is the spiritual leader that God wants you to submit to. <br>Doctrines raised from the Scriptures will set you apart from the world.

      "One thing that everyone who is born again must learn is that the Christian walk is not a sprint but a marathon. I have been born again since 1973, and I am still on the journey until now. We were told back then, “Jesus is coming soon.” 'Soon' has run into more than 51 years now, and we are still awaiting His arrival. This tells you that without perseverance, you cannot win in the Christian race. It is good that you resisted temptation yesterday and did not fall, but that is not enough to ensure that you will remain standing until the end. You must also resist the temptation that is coming tomorrow. If a believer relaxes because of the things he or she has overcome in the past, it is likely that the fellow will be brought down by future temptations. <br>It is in perseverance that many Christians fail. The devil knows that if he brings temptation to you once, you might not fall. However, he knows that if he keeps bringing the temptation over and over again in different forms and intensities, one day, when you are relaxed spiritually, you will likely fall. This is why having oil for today is good, but you must always have extra oil for tomorrow. The ten virgins in Matthew 25:1-13 were all virgins, meaning that they were all pure. They all had oil which signifies the Holy Spirit, but while they were waiting for the arrival of the Groom, they all slept because the Groom tarried. However, only the ones with extra oil were able to meet with the Groom. Proverbs 24:10 says: <br><strong><em>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. </em></strong><br>You must be prepared for the day of adversity. Believe me, without extra strength, you will not be able to persevere until the end. Therefore, read your Bible beyond what you need for today, pray longer hours than you need for today, and serve God more fervently than is necessary for today. Doing these will build in you the strength that you need to persevere. Many people have yielded to fraud in their offices because the oil finished, and they didn't have extra to keep them on fire. Some yielded to fornication and adultery because their strength failed. Don't make this mistake; get extra oil always.",

      "When you read Bible verses like 1 Corinthians 6:20, which says that you have been bought with a price, you might begin to wonder, “Bought from who? When did I consent to being owned by someone else which warranted buying me off that fellow?” This expression in itself tells us that every human being, whether they know it or not, and regardless of how they feel about it, is owned by a spirit. Everyone was conceived in sin (Psalms 51:5), and until they become born again, they remain properties of the devil. <br>Nobody is totally independent; every single person is owned by one spirit or the other. The question now is, who owns you? You can tell who owns a property by the way the property is being used; a property will reflect the character and personality of its owner. That is why Matthew 7:18-20 says: <br><strong><em>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. </em></strong><br>If you are owned by Christ, people will see the character of Christ, which is also known as the fruit of the Spirit, in you. Does your character reflect Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness and Temperance? (Galatians 5:22-23). If these do not define you, then it is likely that it is not God who owns you. Since there are only two divides in the spirit realm – the kingdom of darkness and the kingdom of God, anyone that God does not own, is owned by the devil. This person will automatically engage in the works of the flesh as listed in Galatians 5:19-21. When you read that passage, you will see that many of the people who do these things do not even know that they are acting in accordance with their owner – the devil. For example, many people who envy think that it is just natural for humans to envy; they don't know that envy can only stay in their hearts because they are not owned by the One who is Love Himself. The Bible tells us in Romans 6:16: <br><strong><em>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </em></strong><br>When Christ becomes your owner, you will no longer behave in line with the character of the devil.

      "The Bible makes it plain that God values work. Whether you're a full-time parent, bus driver, artist, or engineer, God is concerned about your work, as long as what you do for a living is legitimate. Work is a major component of God's overall plan for man. In the Garden of Eden, after God made man, He told him to tend the garden (Genesis 2:15). This means that any man that does not work is malfunctioning because man was made to work. <br>The value of work is inherent. Work gives pleasure, which is why some retired people are still working even after their retirement. There is no pleasure in just sitting around from morning until night-time, doing nothing. Many wealthy people fall into depression when they feel like they have made a lot of money and don't need to work anymore. There is no pleasure in accomplishing nothing. For example, when you work on a garden, you will get a lot of pleasure when you see the fruits in that garden begin to blossom. <br>The memory verse for today says that God will give every man according to the fruit of his doings, so if a fellow does nothing, he or she will get nothing. This is why 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says: <br><strong>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. </strong><br>The reason God gave you talents is so that you can put them to work. If a believer does not use his or her talents, he or she will answer to God on the last day (Matthew 25:14-30). God cannot condone laziness at all. John 5:17 says: <br><strong>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</strong> <br>If God is working, He will not allow you to be lazy. My God is not a God of lazy people. If a believer is lazy and is asking God for blessings, He will ignore such a believer. Working hard is a godly value, and laziness is ungodly. You cannot claim to be a Christian and yet be lazy. Even if you are unemployed, pray to God and find something that you can do to contribute positively to the society, no matter how small it may be.

      "For many Christians, when they are having a dispute born again. As they don't seem to like a fellow or the fellow doesn't like them, they treat him or her badly. Jesus Christ said in Luke 6:35 that you must not only love your enemies, you should also be kind to them. When you know the right things to do for people, whether you are on good terms with them or not, do it. The Bible says that it is sinful for you to know something good that you are supposed to do and not do it. James 4:17 says: <br><strong><em>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. </em></strong><br>Don't victimise someone with your position because the person is not your friend. Whether you are the one who is right or not does not matter, the moment you decide to victimise them, you become the one who is wrong. <br>In the Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ said clearly that you are not to repay evil with evil, rather, you are to repay evil with good. The reason for this is that He does not want your heart to abhor any form of corruption or evil at all. Apostle Paul said that when you decide to avenge yourself or repay evil for evil, you are letting evil overcome you. Romans 12:20-21 says: <br><strong><em>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</em></strong> <br>The Scripture above says that you should love, care for, and even provide for those that hate you. You shouldn't relate with people based on whether they love you or not or on how they treat you; you should relate with them based on how God wants you to. Don't let evil overcome you in a bid to repay someone or show them how powerful you are. If evil overcomes you, it means that you are now on the side of the devil as opposed to the side of God.

You wouldn't go to your father's house and not care about the outlook and advancement of the place. <br>There are many benefits of being a worker in God's house.

Your wages when you work for Him include protection, provision, a sound mind, deliverance, speedy answers to prayers, and a whole lot more. While it is fine for a church to employ or pay professionals for some services, I always tell church members who are adamant about charging a fee for rendering any service without being employed by the church that they shouldn't expect anything from God again, as they cannot get paid twice for the same service.

The most dangerous thing about it is that it is not specifically listed amongst the works of the flesh in Galatians 5:19-21, and so many Christians are not careful of it. Also, many people think that peer pressure only applies to teenagers, but it is also present among older people. For example, when you go to a wedding, and you join your peers in dancing to worldly songs because you don't want them to see you sitting aside, that is peer pressure making you do something against God's will. You cannot please God and man at the same time. King Saul tried to please men, and he displeased God as a result. He lost his throne and died a shameful death (1 Samuel 31:1- 6). <br>Don't try to dress like the world because you don't want to seem 'left out'. Don't try to use dirty slangs to show that you are also familiar with current trends. Many years ago, I was a guest minister somewhere, and when the man of God who was to introduce me went to the altar to do the introduction, he said that he liked everything about me except the way I dressed like a hunter with my short-sleeved suits. I replied that I am not a hunter, I am a soldier. His remarks did not make me change the way I dress, even though my colleagues were wearing flowing agbada around that time. Today, God has raised me very high amongst my colleagues. Children of God are not influenced by peer pressure; they are led by the Spirit of God (Romans 8:14). When a Christian starts doing things because of what people will say or think, such a believer has stopped being led by the Spirit of God, and the fellow is already losing his or her sonship. <br>The word of God says in 2 Corinthians 6:17 that you must be separate. If people are to be seen as your peers, let them be people who have separated themselves for Christ. Amongst these people, you can bow to the peer pressure of who is praying the longest, who has memorized more Scriptures, who wins the most number of souls per day, et cetera. That is the only kind of peer pressure that is good for a Christian; pressure to please God more and draw closer to Him, not pressure that relates to carnal things.",

      "Many-a-times, the devil whispers things into our ears to deceive us so that we will not walk in the identity and authority that God has given to us. This is why it is necessary to know who you truly are in Christ. A king's son that does not know who he is will beg for food even in his father's palace. You must know who you are, and you can only know this when you see yourself the way God sees you. How does God see you? <br>If you are confronted by a situation that seems tough and the devil is trying to tell you that you will not win, remember what the Bible says in Romans 8:37: <strong><em>“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.”</em></strong> Even though that situation may have conquered some people in the past, it cannot conquer you because you are more than a conqueror through Christ who loved you and loves you forever. Sometimes, the devil will tell you that you are not good enough to be at the top or achieve your goals. Laugh and quote Deuteronomy 28:13 to him: <strong><em>“And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath;…”</em></strong> The Bible says that you will be above only, so there is no space for you at the bottom; the only space available for you as a child of God is above, and you will take your place, in Jesus' name. <br>The devil can say whatever he wants, but when you know the truth, you will not listen to him or accept his lies. When you know the real you in Christ, you will ignore whatever the devil says because you know that he is a liar (John 8:44). As you ignore him, your actions and thoughts will also follow suit. You will not let his lies dictate what you do or what you don't. His words must not shape your thoughts concerning what you believe about yourself or not. <br>The devil is too small to control the thoughts and actions of a believer. Your living, moving and being must be in God and not in any other counsel as we see in Acts 17:28: <br><strong><em>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</em></strong>",

      "A shepherd can fail his sheep in two major ways. One of the ways is by not giving them food and making them starve to death, while the other is by not protecting them from predators. If you are a leader in the body of Christ whom God has placed over some of His sheep, you must ensure that you preserve them by feeding them with the accurate word of God and protecting them from false teachers who are actually wolves in sheep's clothing. <br>In Acts 20:28, shepherds are told sternly to feed the flock in their care. If you are not teaching the people that God has put in your care the true and complete word of God, you are killing them spiritually, and God will not spare you for that. No human being can live long if he/she is malnourished, so also, the souls of the people in your care will perish if they are malnourished. As you teach them prosperity, also teach them holiness. As you teach them about Christ's love, don’t leave out the fact that He is also the consuming fire. Don’t worry about the church's growth, do what God has called you to do, and He will grow His church. <br>The apostles regularly warned the sheep about false teachers and their teachings (2 Corinthians 11:13-15, 2 Peter 2:1). They were protecting them from wolves, and we must do the same. There are all sorts of doctrines going around these days that are completely opposite to God's word. Don't ignore them; tell your people never to listen to such teachings. If you don’t tell them to stay away from such teachings because you don’t want to offend anyone, you will leave them to be devoured by wolves. <br>Social media has created many opportunities for false teachers to confuse some of the sheep with their teachings. The sheep may see someone working miracles and believe that he or she is a genuine minister of God. They might start listening to the fellow's teachings, so you must ensure that what they are listening to is not the lure of a wolf. Teach your followers to be like the Berean Christians who always checked any teaching they heard against the word of God (Acts 17:10-11). <br>Whether you are a pastor, head of a department, house fellowship leader, or parent, if you have been placed as a spiritual leader over some people, it is your responsibility to ensure that the devil does not devour them.",

      "Oppositions are different from persecutions.\xa0Persecution happens when someone attacks you because you are a Christian, while oppositions happen when you are attacked in a bid to stop you from doing whatever you have planned to do for God. Many people have set out to do things for God and were faced with opposition that made them back down. Some of them remained fervent Christians, but the opposition discouraged them from going ahead to do what was in their hearts for God. If we allow oppositions to stop us from doing what God has called us to do, many souls will perish in hell, and the devil will oppress people because the Christians are quiet. Therefore, rather than allow oppositions to stop you, you must learn to keep going despite them. <br>One man who faced opposition and kept going until the work was done was Nehemiah. He had set out to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, despite the fact that it was not going to be an easy task – then, opposition arose. If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will see the three major tools of opposition that the devil employs against Christians: mockery (Nehemiah 4:3), threats (Nehemiah 4:7-8) and discouragement (Nehemiah 4:10). He can raise people to mock you for what you are doing, but you must ignore them. Some people will threaten you with many things or even death if you continue to do what you are doing for God. However, you should not be afraid because God will take care of such people for you. Lastly, the devil can bring discouragement by making the work more difficult. He can do it by ensuring the unavailability of resources or some people's refusal to cooperate with you. Whether the devil brings one or all of these things your way, if God has given you a vision, you must never back down. <br><strong><em>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. </em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNehemiah 4:9<br> Nehemiah's default response to all the opposition he faced was to pray. Prayer is not a last resort but your primary defence against oppositions. As you do all that you humanly can to forestall oppositions, put your trust in God. Place your ears on His chest to hear the next instruction He will give you; after all, you are doing His work. The people opposing you are actually opposing Him, so let Him do the fighting while you keep working.",

      "As long as this world remains, every true child of God will face persecution because the devil is the prince of this world (John 14:30). You must therefore be well-equipped to handle persecutions so that they won't derail you from your race to heaven. <br>The devil persecutes you as a child of God because he wants you to deny Christ, and the only way to pass through persecution without denying Christ is to be well-grounded in Him. Therefore, before persecutions come and before the devil launches his attacks, you must be well-rooted in Christ by studying God's word, memorising it, and praying without ceasing. The depth of a tree's root determines if it will remain standing during a storm. If you don't want persecution to bring you down, you must be deeply rooted in God's word. Those who fail in times of persecution are those who were not as intimate with Christ as they should have been before persecution came. <br>Long ago, there was a missionary in a foreign land where Christians were being persecuted. On her wedding day, the local police raided the missionary base and arrested her in her wedding dress. She kissed the handcuffs they put on her and said, “Lord, I didn't know you were so jealous over me and wouldn't let me marry anyone else. How beautiful is your wedding ring to me!” She was so in love with Christ that her wedding being invaded meant nothing to her; she saw the handcuffs as wedding rings. That is the kind of intimacy you must have with Christ so as not to deny Him in the face of persecution. <br>When people compromise after facing a little persecution, like not being promoted at work because of their Christian values, I shake my head because I know that they were never really rooted in Christ. Christians who are truly rooted in Christ rejoice when they are persecuted because they know they are blessed (Matthew 5:10-12). They see persecution as a sign that they are a terror to the devil, and that excites them; they want to cause him even more terror. Persecution drives them to do more for God against the kingdom of darkness. In Acts 5:41, the disciples rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for Jesus' name. In 1 Peter 4:13, we are told to rejoice that we are partakers of Christ's sufferings. Don't let persecution weigh you down; let it become fuel for you to do more for God.",

      "I discussed handling failure properly yesterday. factor that can affect success in life; there is also the need to learn how to handle success correctly. Many people have eventually failed in life because they did not know how to handle their success. <br>In 1957, a man won £75,000 in a lottery. In those days, you could buy a flat in London for a tiny fraction of that sum. One day in the early 1980s, somewhere in Western Nigeria, I saw a man that was wearing rags, sitting beside a building that had collapsed in half. I asked the fellow who was driving me, “Who is that fellow?” He said, “That is the man who won £75,000 in 1957.” The man had great prosperity but did not know how to handle it, so he ended up poor. A popular proverb inspired by Proverbs 21:20 says that a fool and his prosperity are soon separated. If a fellow is not wise enough to handle success, it can turn out to be the beginning of great failure. <br>Don't get over-excited when success comes. Many people start rejoicing and partying after a victory, forgetting that the devil never relaxes. What actually happens is that the devil becomes more determined to bring such people down. Don't miss prayer meetings or your personal devotion because you are celebrating a victory. Yes, you won the battle, but the enemy is not dead yet; he is still roaming, looking for whom to devour (1 Peter 5:8). You should increase your commitment to God after every victory and not the other way around. <br>The devil knows that after successes, people are likely to relax, so he usually attacks them during such periods. After David killed Goliath, he raised King Saul up against him. It was after Elijah called down fire from heaven that Jezebel swore to kill him (1 Kings 19:1-3). When you attain success in a particular thing, you must not relax. You must remain alert and ready for battle. Don't let success distract you from the end goal that God has called you to achieve. <br>One great success we had in RCCG was a programme called Lekki '98, where over six million people gathered in one place to worship God. Immediately after that programme, we doubled our missionary efforts, sending missionaries to new territories. We immediately started planning the next edition of the programme, and today, we have held much bigger programmes because we doubled our efforts and did not relax after our success.",

      "The way people respond to failures determines whether they will eventually live in victory or not. Failure is not as bad as people paint it to be; it does not signify the end, but it is a signal to try again using a different method. Almost all scientific breakthroughs result from failure. If most scientists became sad and stopped after the first time they failed, they would never have had breakthroughs. Every successful person you see is a product of many failures. If you try today and fail, rise up and try again in a different way. As long as you are sure that what you are doing is in line with the will of God, don't give up on it; keep trying until you succeed. <br>In today's Bible reading, the Israelites asked God if they should go to battle against the Benjamites and if they would win. God told them to fight and that they would win. However, when they got to the battlefield, they were defeated. The question on their minds would have been, “Did God deceive us?” They refused to give up, got themselves together, and went to ask God again if they should return to battle the Benjamites. God told them to go, and once again, the Benjamites defeated them. At that point, giving up would have seemed reasonable; they had already lost 40,000 men, and it looked as if God, the only one they could trust, was deceiving them. If they had given up, they would have been commended for trying, but they did not give up. They went back to God, and this time, they fasted and gave offerings to God. They asked again if they should return to fight the Benjamites, and God said that they should go. They went, and as you read in the story, they used a different strategy and were able to defeat the Benjamites. Don't give up; your breakthrough is probably just around the corner. Try once again.<br>When next you encounter failure, ask yourself, “Why is God letting me go through this?” If you have been consistent with your prayer life and walk with God, ask, “What can I learn from this experience? What is God trying to teach me with this failure? Are there other strategies to achieve my goal?” If you answer these questions sincerely, you will draw valuable lessons that will help you achieve success the next time you try.",

It was generally believed that he single-handedly protected the town from all forms of evil, and he was feared by all. When we wanted to open the RCCG parish in my village, the place we found suitable for a rally was close to Kaka's house. Surprisingly, when an altar call was made during the rally, Kaka came out of his house to give his life to Christ – he had been listening to the worship session and sermon. Later that night, he came to my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, and said, “The way you spoke about your God, He must be really powerful.” Papa said, “Very, very powerful.” Kaka said, “In that case, now that I have given my life to Jesus, I would need help with an idol in my house called shigidi. It is an effigy that has been in my family for generations and that we send out at night when we want to kill someone. It is so dangerous that we must not sleep until it returns, and we must kill a ram to welcome it. Upon its return, it will step on the ram's blood and drink it. Thereafter, it will return to its position and become just like an ordinary effigy. I am afraid of the trouble that might follow if I throw shigidi away.” <br>Papa decided to send me over to remove the effigy. I went to Kaka's house with the pastor of our parish in Ilesha and a church worker that I thought to be a strong prayer warrior. When Kaka saw me, he felt sorry for me, “Ahhh, Adeboye's son, you are the one they sent?” When my colleagues saw shigidi, they ran out of the house, leaving me alone with the effigy. It was smeared with blood and adorned with all manner of charms. I said a prayer, broke the effigy into pieces, removed the shrine in front of the house, and threw everything into a river. After three weeks, I returned to my village and visited Kaka at home. When he saw me, he shouted, “You are still alive?!” That was 1975. I am still alive almost five decades after. <br>Beloved, the devil and his demons are under the feet of even the smallest child of God.

This is when people pray, but their hearts are not in the prayer. Rather, their minds are occupied with other things. The devil knows that if your mind is distracted while praying, your prayer will not carry as much power as it should.

      "Today, I will conclude my discussion on some of the factors that can extinguish prayers. Some people get almost everything right in the place of prayer but miss out on just one thing – faith. Today's memory verse says that believers should always make their requests to God in faith without having any doubts in their hearts. The next verse directly addresses anyone who makes requests from God without faith: <br><strong><em>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. </em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJames 1:7 <br>When you pray without faith, that prayer is dead on arrival. <br>Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Believers cannot expect God to answer their prayers when He is not pleased with them. God requires that you have faith in Him when you ask Him for something. Luke 17:6 says that even if your faith is as little as a mustard seed, God will use it to move mountains on your behalf. If your child asks you for food and then looks at you in such a way that says, “I know you will not give me; you probably don't even have it,” you will feel insulted. This is what we do when we ask God for things that we are not really expecting Him to give to us. <br>When you come to God in faith, you come knowing without a doubt that what you have asked of Him is already done. You bring your requests with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6) because you know that your prayer has already been answered. The moment you pray, your hands are already stretched out to God, expecting what you asked for. This is how to pray; it is the kind of prayer that God cannot ignore. Hebrews 11:1 says that faith is the evidence of things not seen. In other words, when you have faith, even though you have not seen what you are asking for, you will be so sure that you have it that you can present it in court as evidence to any judge, telling them, “See what I have.” <br>For a long time, I tried by my own power to increase my faith, but it was difficult. Then, I read Mark 9:24, where a man cried to Jesus, saying that he believes but that Jesus should help his unbelief. In minutes, what Jesus was asking him to believe for was done. I also started praying that God should help my faith, and I have seen my faith grow tremendously since then. If you pray the same prayer, Jesus will give your faith a boost, and you will be able to overcome unbelief.",

      "Yesterday, I discussed how sin can extinguish our prayers. Another prayer extinguisher is - not praying according to God’s will. You must understand that God has a plan for your life and wants to bring you to an expected end (Jeremiah 29:11). This means that God already has an expectation about you before you were born. Thus, everything He does, including the prayers He answers, is to bring you to that expected end. You cannot pray for God to do something against His will and expect Him to do it. <br>Many people have said, “I have been asking God for a particular thing for so long without an answer.” Where they are probably getting it wrong is that they are not checking if what they are asking for aligns with God's will or if it's just for their selfish lusts (James 4:3). Asking for something outside God's will is asking amiss; such prayers are extinguished, and God will not grant such requests. This is why you must be intimate with the Holy Spirit. Romans 8:26 says that we do not know how to pray because, many-a-times, we don't know the will of the Father. However, the Holy Spirit can help you to pray exactly what the will of the Father is, and then your prayers will be attended to. <br>When you pray in tongues, you are praying very accurate prayers because the Holy Spirit is praying the will of the Father through you. Imagine that you are friends with the son of the chairman of a company, and you apply for a job in that company, using an application letter that was written by a director in the company, and having the chairman's son, who is also a director, as your referee. When your application gets to the chairman's table, he will not be able to ignore it because it will contain the exact things that relate to the organisation and the role you are applying for, and also because his son is your referee. You will surely have the job because your application will contain exactly what is on the chairman's mind, and you have a good relationship with his son. <br>If you don't want your prayers extinguished, let the Holy Spirit pray through you as you maintain an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ in whose name you are praying.

David said in Psalms 66:18: <br><strong>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me: </strong><br>If sin is in your heart, it will extinguish your prayer, and God will not hear it, even if you scream aloud while praying.

Many years ago, when the congregation was not as large as it is now, and I could lay hands on everyone, a woman came to one of our Holy Ghost Services. She had been married for many years without a child and had been told that I have a special anointing for making the barren fruitful. I laid hands on her during the service, and she fell under the anointing. However, months after that, she still did not conceive. She came back complaining, “They told me that when you lay hands on me, I will fall, and then I will become fruitful, but up to now, there is still no child”. I thought she needed an extra dose of the anointing and was about to pray for her again when God told me, “Son, ask her how many boyfriends she has.” It was hard to ask her the question, but I managed to mumble the words. She replied that she had six boyfriends. I exclaimed, “Ah! And you expect my God to answer your prayer?” Yes, I prayed for her and laid hands on her, but her sin extinguished the prayers. <br>Check yourself before you pray to be sure that you don't have any sin in your heart because if sin is present, your prayers will go to waste. Repent of the sin first, then you can be sure that God will answer your prayers. The only prayer that God will hear from a sinner is the prayer of repentance from sin because as long as sin exists in his or her life, God will not hear him or her (Isaiah 59:1-2).",

Before you go, you must first book an appointment. If the president asks you to come by 2pm and you get there early, you may still not be allowed to see him until 5pm because the president is busy. At times, it is the president who needs you, but you still must wait. No president is as busy as God, yet He is always available to give you His undivided attention whenever you call on Him – He is never too busy. <br>Jesus said that whenever we come to God in prayers, we should come in His name. I can send you to someone and give you a signed note asking the fellow to give you what you want. However, when I say you should go in my name, what I mean is that, even though you are the one going there, when you arrive at the gate, tell them it is Adeboye who has arrived. When the people see you, they are to receive you and treat you as if I am the one they are welcoming. <br>Jesus asking you to pray to the Father in His name means that even though you are the one praying, the Father is to see that prayer point as if He prayed it. Since Jesus and the Father are one (John 10:30), it also implies that whatever the Father owns, the Son owns also, so as the Father will not refuse to give Jesus whatever He asks for, He will also not refuse to give you whatever you ask for according to His will. <br>If Jesus appears to you and tells you that the moment you ask Him for anything, you will get it, will you stay silent or start asking for whatever you need? He already told you in John 16:23 that if you ask Him for anything, He will give it to you. This is why you should pray for everything you need. Many people complain about things they can change by simply praying. Jesus is waiting to give you whatever you ask Him for. <br>Don't be worried about anything; just pray in Jesus’ name, and the problem is solved (John 14:13-14).",

Romans 8:31 says: <br><strong><em>What shall we then say to these things?

The Bible says that you have been bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:20) and that price is the blood of Jesus. This means that no one can touch you because you are God's possession. Through the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus flowing inside you, you are irreversibly blessed. God has blessed you with all heavenly blessings, and there is no man that can curse you! Numbers 23:23 says: <br><strong><em>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! </em></strong><br>In Proverbs 26:2, you are reassured that: <br><strong><em>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. </em></strong><br>If someone decides to curse you without a genuine cause, do not be moved and do not be afraid.

John 1:14 says: <br><strong><em>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. </em></strong><br>What was Jesus\' purpose for coming to the world as a man? Let us examine some of the answers that the Bible gives us concerning this: <br>1. He came to call sinners to repentance. Matthew 9:13 says, <strong><em>“But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</em></strong> <br>2. He came to give eternal life. John 10:10 says, <strong><em>"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”</em></strong> <br>3. He came to heal, deliver and set the captives free. Luke 4:18 says,<strong><em> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,”</em></strong> <br>4. To destroy the works of the devil. 1 John 3:8 says, <strong><em>"… For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”</em></strong> <br>Considering these scriptural references about Jesus\' purpose for coming into this world, has His coming had any impact on your life? If you cannot answer this question clearly, then you need to invite Jesus into your life, even if you have done so before. Surrender your life completely to Him today and make a commitment to live holy going forward. This way, the purpose of Jesus coming to the earth as a man will be fulfilled in your life, and you will live above sicknesses, diseases, captivity, and the works of the devil.

    bodyText:
      "When you consider the word 'husband,' you will see its similarity with the word 'husbandry'. Husbandry has to do with caring for and cultivating crops and livestock. This gives us insight into the duty of husbands; they are to tend their wives like gardens for their potential to blossom. They should nurture their potential and make them more beautiful and fruitful than when they met them. People admire some men's wives because those men tend their gardens well. The way a man tends his garden is a reflection of the kind of person he is. <br>Gardens bring beauty to homes; if a garden is fruitful, then the family will be nourished with healthy fruits, vegetables, and fresh air. However, if a garden is filled with thorns, a lot of pain and parasites will exist in that home. Many married men who are always miserable and sad often complain about their wives not making them happy. Their wives can't make them happy when they are sad and miserable; it is only what they receive that they can give. If you're a husband, what you should put in your wife is what you want. Take care of her and make her happy; she will make you happy too. Before you buy a shirt for yourself, buy a dress for her. If you call her a witch and maltreat her, know that you made her one because when you were courting, you were calling her an angel. It is after she entered your house that she became a witch. <br>Another definition of husbandry, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is the management and conservation of resources. Many husbands don't seem to see anything special in their wives; those are bad husbands. A good husband will see the potentials in his wife in the form of her talents and giftings and will help her manage them properly to yield the best results. As a husband, in managing your wife's resources, you should also manage her excesses and shortcomings; that is the aspect of weeding in husbandry. Those shortcomings will try to hinder her talents from blossoming, but it is your duty to identify them and reduce them to the barest minimum. <br>A good husband does not complain about his wife's shortcomings; he manages them to ensure they don't stop her gifts from blossoming. A good husband will patiently work with his wife to overcome her shortcomings and enhance her talents. The great women out there also have their shortcomings, but thank God they have good husbands. They are great achievers notwithstanding and are making their husbands proud today.",

      "Yesterday, I started teaching on the importance of living by God's principles. Today, I will conclude the teaching. <br>I thank God for His grace, but I also thank Him for making me study mathematics before I became born again. If there is anything mathematics teaches you, it is that certain formulas will only work if you meet certain conditions. For example, in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides will be equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This will always be true, whether on Earth or on the moon. It is foolish for anyone to try to get certain results without first meeting the necessary conditions. Even Jesus Christ had to be baptised by John the Baptist to fulfil one of the conditions for success in His assignment on Earth (Matthew 3:15). <br>Do you know that there are many people whose breakthroughs have already been released by God, but they are yet to experience it? The door they have been asking God to open was already opened a long time ago; God is only waiting for them to do what they need to do to walk in. Unfortunately, many people are wasting the answers to their prayers just because they refuse to obey simple principles. I have always told my children, even though the Almighty God had said that Sarah would give birth to a son for Abraham and had quickened their dead bodies according to Romans 4:19, if Abraham had not been intimate with her, Isaac would never have been born. Many miracles have already been released by God to many of His children, but instead of them to do what they need to do to get the miracle, they are being mis-spiritual. By mis-spiritual, I mean spirituality in the wrong direction. Can you imagine a couple looking for the fruit of the womb not being intimate with each other, but observing prayer vigils daily? Or a student who has not studied at all, praying all night to pass an exam that is slated for 7am in the morning? <br>True spirituality does not suspend the senses; in fact, true spirituality births wisdom because wisdom is a gift of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:8). <br>I pray for you today, mis-spirituality will not be your portion, in Jesus' name. The devil will not make you blind to the principles that will birth your breakthrough.

      "Many Christians complain that things are not going well for them even though it has been a while since they confessed Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour. The question I often ask such Christians is, “Since you received Jesus Christ into your life, have you been living by His principles?” It is a good thing to have Jesus in your life, however, you must ensure that you also live by His principles if you want to experience positive changes in all aspects of your life. <br>No matter how spiritual you are, certain principles must be applied for certain things to work in your life. For example, the Bible says that he that does not work should not eat (2 Thessalonians 3:10). No matter how prayerful you are, if you are lazy, you may not escape poverty (Proverbs 6:10- 11). <br>Shortly after I became born again, tapes of many pastors teaching the power of positive confession were circulating around the Christian community. They would say things like, “You will become whomever you say you are. Just confess good; say what you want to see in your life.” Although this message is correct, many took it the wrong way. Lazy Christians continued being lazy, while the uneducated ones did not pursue education to enhance their ability to earn. They all just kept confessing, “I am rich, I am not poor,” “I am a landlord, I will never beg,” and so on, but nothing changed in their lives. <br>If you want change, you must adopt the principles of God. One of His principles is in Luke 6:38; if you don't sow seeds, you shouldn't expect a harvest. Being stingy and yet praying for God to bless you is like being a farmer who did not plant any seed but who goes to his farm every morning to pray that yams should grow there. During the season of harvest, when he digs the ground to get yams, he will find nothing there because he planted nothing. <br>Some other principles of God which I will like to mention are: Do unto others what you want them to do to you (Matthew 7:12), exercise control over your mouth (Psalms 141:3) and your appetite (Proverbs 23:1-3), let others praise you, don't praise yourself (Proverbs 27:2), always do things in steps, start small and grow from there (Zechariah 4:10), whatever you embark on, ensure that you plan properly for it to be achieved successfully (Luke 14:28). These and many more are principles of life that may not necessarily lead you to hell if they are not practised, but will definitely help you to live a better life on earth if they are.",

The good news, however, is that it does not matter what the world may say; my Daddy is the miracle-working God, and miracles happen when He steps into a matter. <br>In 2 Kings 6:1-7, when the sons of the prophets were cutting wood so they could build a bigger dwelling place for themselves, the axe head that one of them was using fell into the water, and he cried to Elisha. The young man cried because he knew that, according to the law of nature, when a heavy metal like an axe head drops in the water, it will sink to the bottom. He also knew that no one amongst them could swim to the bottom of the water to pick up the axe head. He thought he was finished, but thankfully, he called on a representative of the Miracle Worker on Earth for help. The moment the Miracle Worker was introduced to the situation, hope came. All Elisha did was to simply reverse the law of nature. He put a little stick into the water, it went to the bottom of the river, and the heavy axe head swam to the surface. The Miracle Worker will reverse any law of nature to bring hope to every hopeless situation in your life or around you today, in Jesus' name. <br>Do you need a miracle? Are you in a situation where you know that the only way out is if God intervenes? All you need to do is cry out to Him today. Don't try to work things out on your own; take out time to cry to Him until you hear a word from Him. Doctors are helpless when faced with incurable diseases, but with The Great Physician, no disease is incurable. If the body part is so damaged that it cannot be repaired, He will simply replace it because He is the manufacturer.

If a believer is allowing sin or an appearance of sin around him or her, he or she is taking fire in his or her bosom and will eventually be burned. <br>I learned from Joseph's story that when the devil is determined to bring a man down, he will position temptation around him such that he will keep seeing it continually. He knows that if the temptation is right in front of the fellow every day, it is only a matter of time before he falls. This is why I have always told my children that they must not have a secretary or personal assistant who is of the opposite sex. It is better not to bring the temptation anywhere near you than to believe that you can resist it. <br>A common adage in Yoruba land says, if you will not eat it, don't smell it. If a man has been asking you for a relationship that you know will lead to sin, why are you still answering his calls? If you are always tempted to steal, why will you agree to help your group or department keep the money they have contributed? You must stay far from whatever you know can lead you to sin because the devil is described as a serpent. A serpent is very subtle and cunning. As dangerous as it is, it can crawl right beside you without you realising it. You may have sworn that you will never do something, but if you allow that thing around you, the devil will cunningly get you to do it. <br>The elders say that it is through an opening in a wall that the lizard gains entrance into the house. When you give room to temptation around you, you have opened up the wall of your soul, and it is only a matter of time before sin creeps in. Unfriend that friend who always suggests sinful things, relocate from that area where you are more susceptible to committing sin, delete whatever is on your phone that can lead you to sin, and just do whatever it takes to get sin\xa0far away from you.

Thank God Moses was wise enough to turn to God because, at crossroads like that, the only way out is the way God provides. <br>In situations like the one the Israelites were in, you should face God and say, “Lord, this Red Sea must part. I will not let You go except You make a way for me.” Those are not times for gentlemanly prayers; they are times for violent prayers such that God will know that you will not rest until you get a miracle. <br>I remember one time that I was in such a situation. I lay flat on the road in the middle of the night at Redemption City, crying to God desperately for help. When there is a serious problem and there is no way out, I hold on to God in prayers, and I don't let go until He parts the sea and makes a way for me. <br>In Matthew 15:22-28, the Canaanite woman knew that the only solution to her daughter's problem was with Jesus, so she did not let anything deter her; she pestered Him until she got what she wanted.

She knew that the only way out of her problem was to make contact with Jesus, so even though the crowd was great and she was weak from all the bleeding, she pressed through until she touched Him and got her healing. <br>Maybe the reason some Christians are relaxed in the place of prayer is that they cannot see how close the enemy is to them.

      "While I was in secondary school, my teacher told\xa0us that every human being came into the world with a pillow of suffering which they must use before they leave the earth. You can choose to use your pillow of suffering when you are young so that you can enjoy your life when you are old, or you can keep it intact and enjoy yourself when you are young. However, you must understand that you will surely use the pillow when you are old. <br>If you decide to use your pillow of suffering when you are young, you will put yourself through strict discipline. You will study while others are playing, attend vigils while others are partying, build a good character while others are engaging in vices, and save while others spend all their income. The memory verse for today says that periods of discipline may not seem pleasant, but they bring peace of mind in the future. Those who do not put themselves through discipline early in their lives will surely have their pillows of suffering waiting for them in the future. The choice is yours, go through the suffering of discipline now, or face the consequences of indiscipline later. <br><strong><em>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</em></strong> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEcclesiastes 7:8 <br>Your end is more important than your beginning. It doesn't matter if you are from a poor background; what matters is that you don't die poor. It doesn't matter if you were heading to hell; what matters is that you end up in heaven. Don't trade your tomorrow for the short-term pleasures of today. Esau was hungry, and he traded his right as the firstborn for a plate of porridge; he traded generational blessings for a single plate of porridge! Today, we would have been talking about the God of Abraham, Isaac and Esau, but Esau gave his position to Jacob because he wanted to eat porridge. You might say that Esau was foolish, but many people are doing the same thing today. There are people who were destined to be great prophets but never fulfilled their destiny because of five minutes of sexual immorality. Some potential owners of multinational businesses trade working on their business ideas for a little more sleep every night. <br>Beloved, the cost of discipline today is nothing compared to its gains in the future.",

      "God does not give miracles to proud people. I\xa0have noticed that everyone who got a miracle from Jesus approached Him in humility. The leper in Matthew 8:2-3 worshipped Him, the centurion in Matthew 8:5-10 didn't send a messenger but came personally to ask Jesus to heal his servant, and the woman in Matthew 15:22-28 was practically insulted by Jesus when He likened her to a dog, but she took no offence. On the other hand, everyone that would have gotten a miracle from Jesus but didn’t, exhibited pride in one way or the other, especially the people of His hometown (Matthew 13:54-58). The Bible says that He was only able to do a few miracles there. <br>Naaman almost died a leper because of pride. He went to the prophet for healing and was told to go and wash in River Jordan. He got angry and wanted to return to his country to die as a leper because he thought that a man of his calibre should not wash in the Jordan river. Thank God for his servants who talked sense into his head. <br>Sometimes, God will give me an instruction that sounds childish during our Holy Ghost Services. Because I am a child in His hands, I will tell the people what He says, and those who are not too big to obey the childish instruction will come back to testify about how they got their miracle after obeying Him. One time, God told me to call out all those who had back pains and dance around them. That was a very childish thing to do, but I obeyed, and when I was done, their back pains had disappeared, and they could all bend over to touch their toes conveniently. <br>If you are too proud to submit to a man of God, you cannot get a miracle through him. If you are too big to carry out an instruction because it seems beneath your social status, you cannot get a miracle. You must humble yourself before the Most High God if you want to enjoy His miracles. It amazes me that people consult doctors in humility, answering all their questions and surrendering their bodies for examination and treatment, but when they come to God, they act in a proud manner as if they know more than Him.",

      "Hebrews 11:3 says that the world was created by God through His words. God is a Spirit (John 4:24), and everything you see in this world has its root in the spirit realm. A tree's roots are a primary determinant of its state, so in the same vein, things in the physical realm are determined by the spirit realm. For example, in Exodus 14:16, Moses stretched his rod and parted the Red Sea. Ordinarily, a sea cannot be parted by stretching a rod; there had to be a spiritual force working on the sea, and that force was what parted it. Now, when you consider that the fellow stretching the rod was a physical being, then he must have had a connection with the root of all things on the earth to control the sea, and that connection is with God. Believe me, if you are a true child of God, there is nothing on earth that you cannot control. You have complete authority over everything because Psalms 82:6 says that you are a god. <br>Many years ago, we were to have Bible Study at a professor's house at the University of Ibadan, but then it started raining. We were so many that the sitting room couldn't contain us, so I used my authority as a child of God to command the rain to stop. The rain stopped, and we had our Bible Study. Not long after we finished, some other people arrived. They were surprised to see that it wasn't raining in the professor's compound because the reason they arrived late was that it was raining everywhere else on the campus. The moment you become a child of God, you have authority over everything that has its root in the spirit realm and that includes the weather, elements of nature, and even demons. If you are a part of God's family, you are a king, and where the word of a king is, there is power (Ecclesiastes 8:4). <br>You must note, however, that if a fellow is not a true child of God and tries to exercise God's authority, he or she will be disgraced like the sons of Sceva (Acts 19:13-16). You must note also that whatever you use your authority to decree must be in line with the word of God. A house divided against itself cannot stand (Matthew 12:25).

      "Today, I want you to consider very well the choice of deciding to stay at home and watch services online over attending physically. Today's Bible text clearly states that you are not to forsake the fellowshipping together of brethren. Therefore, if you choose to attend a service online when you can very well attend that service physically, you are forsaking the fellowshipping together with brethren for your comfort. <br>Due to your preference for comfort over fellowship, many things might follow. Some of these may include picking up phone calls or browsing social media while the service is going on. Also, you might be eating and drinking when you should be concentrating on receiving the bread of life from heaven. In that state, it is easy to welcome distractions from visitors who knock on your door and even things that you suddenly remember that you ought to have done. These things will take your mind completely off the service and make you miss out on what God is doing at that moment. On the other hand, if you are present at a service physically, there will be little or no distractions because almost everybody around you will be focused on God. They will be praying or worshipping God fervently, and the environment around you will be charged; that fire will kindle your own fire too. This is not the same as watching a service on TV. Tell me, if you put on your TV and a TV station is showing a house that is burning, will you feel the heat in your house? <br>Except there is absolutely no way to attend a physical service, either due to distance or other challenges, you cannot get the same impact from the service by watching it at home. God sees your heart; He knows when you are choosing comfort over fellowship with the brethren. He is the one who said that you should not forsake the fellowshipping together of the brethren, so He will not encourage you to disobey Him.

      "Today's cell phones are extremely effective; with them, you can communicate with anybody in the world. Despite this being a positive thing, you must be careful not to live under your phone's influence. You must not get addicted to your phone or live by it because Jesus said that man is to live by every word that comes out of God's mouth (Matthew 4:4). Your Bible is what you must be addicted to and live by, not your phone. If you are not conscious of this, your phone may easily replace the word of God in your life, and this is quite dangerous because the Bible says that our God is a jealous God (Exodus 34:14). <br>When you wake up in the morning, do you pick up your phone first or your Bible? You may say that you pick up your phone to check the time, but really, do you study the apps on your phone first or the verses in your Bible? Throughout the day, what do you have more on your mind, what you saw on your phone or what you read in the Bible? You are to meditate on God's word day and night, not on social media feeds and reels. When you want to start a conversation with your friend in your DM, what interesting thing do you start with, a funny meme or a Scripture? Ephesians 5:19 says that we are to speak to each other in psalms and hymns, but many no longer have such conversations; it is all about celebrity gossip and memes. Can you see that there is a need to repent if your heart has been drawn away from God for so long without you knowing it? It is time to return to God's word and become addicted to it again. It is time to begin to study the word first thing in the morning and last thing at night every day. <br>If your heart has been drawn away from God, to bring your heart back to God's word, you will have to exercise a lot of self-control. You must take decisive actions and stick with them. For example, decide to charge your phone far from you and put your Bible beside your pillow at bedtime. This way, you will read it before you sleep and pick it up when you wake up. You may need to delete some apps that you are addicted to. The time spent on them can be put to better use in prayers and the study of the word of God.",

      "As\xa0I conclude my teaching on good followership which I started some days ago, it is important to note that no matter how strong leaders may appear to be, they need to be encouraged sometimes by their followers. This is primarily because leadership is full of ups and downs. During the down moments, encouraging leaders will go a long way in helping them to succeed. Speaking words of encouragement, sending gifts, and honouring your leaders in whatever way you can, will help them feel encouraged to keep going, despite the burden of leadership. <br>Many years ago, I felt discouraged. I had resigned from my lucrative lecturing job to become the church's General Overseer and spent almost all my time praying for people and teaching them. There was a lot of burden on me, yet it seemed no one appreciated my efforts. One day, I was so discouraged and tired of my position as the General Overseer and then I fell asleep in my office. When I woke up, a young girl was in my office with a cake. She said that God had told her to bring me the cake. I don't really like cakes, but I ate it because I was really touched by her thoughtfulness. When God lays it in your heart to do something to encourage your leader, please do not hesitate to do it; it may be the difference between the leader giving up or continuing the work.<br> A good follower will always try to reduce the stress on a leader rather than add to it. Leaders are human beings like you; they face challenges just like you do, and even more as a result of the leadership position they occupy. You may not be able to totally relieve them of the stress that comes with leadership, but you can encourage them so they don't feel all their effort is a waste, and so they can keep doing more. Some years ago, I was really down, but what helped me to get up and keep going was the message of one of my daughters in the Lord. She said, “Daddy, let God carry you.” Your message may be what God will use to encourage your leader. <br>When Jesus was close to His crucifixion, He took Peter, James and John to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray alongside Him; He needed their encouragement for the task ahead. <br>Pray for your leaders. Sometimes, seeing that you are praying for them is the encouragement they need to keep going.",

      "One\xa0major leadership challenge is that some people see leaders as being superhuman when they are not. I mentioned yesterday that leaders need help sometimes, but beyond that, you should also note that they can make mistakes. <br>When leaders err, people are sometimes afraid to correct them. However, leaders need to be corrected so they don't put their followers in trouble. I'm sure one of David's regrets was not listening to Joab when he was told not to conduct a census because it led to the death of over 70,000 of his followers (1 Chronicles 21:1-14). <br>As a good follower, you must not keep quiet when you see your leader going in the wrong direction; respectfully correct them. Years ago, I published a book in which I tried to justify the statement of the midwives in Exodus 1:15-19, where they said that the Hebrew women were very strong and delivered their babies without assistance. Somebody who read the book boldly came to me and said, “I know you are the General Overseer, but sir, this justification is wrong.” I realised the error, thanked him, and said, “I will go to God; He knows I didn't mean to lead anyone astray.” I re-wrote the book, stood before the congregation, and said, “I have made a mistake. I wrote something in this book that should not have been written. I apologise.” I added, “So we don't keep remembering it, I won't tell you what the mistake is, but I want you to return the copies you have bought, and for every copy you return, I will give you two.” I got all the books back and burnt them. Thank God someone was bold enough to correct me. Today, with how God has increased our influence, it would have been difficult to erase that error from the minds of people in the body of Christ if that fellow had felt that I could not be corrected.<br> In correcting a leader, ensure that it is for the good of the leader and other followers rather than to show that you know better. Discuss with the leader privately, showing love and respect. Present the matter in a way that will be easy to accept, or find someone that is closer to the leader to present it on your behalf. The leader might find it easier to take the correction from that fellow than from you.",

    bodyText:
      "Yesterday, I said that being submissive to a leader and seeking common interests above personal interests are attributes of a good follower. Today, I will discuss more attributes of a good follower. <br>Leaders are not omnipotent; they need help sometimes. Good followers recognise that their leader needs help and seek to provide it before the leader asks for it. They watch to see which areas they can support the leader in and provide the support as needed. <br>In today's Bible reading, Moses did not ask for Aaron and Hur's help. He did not even explain why he was stretching his hands towards the battlefront. They both saw him stretching his hands and noticed that they were winning as he did so. They also noticed that his hands were getting tired, so they went to him, gave him a stone to sit on, and held up his hands. That is good followership, the kind that will make a leader surmount any mountain that stands in his or her way. <br>Sometimes, supporting your leader will not be convenient. When Aaron and Hur helped Moses, they were not sitting down, neither was anyone helping to hold their own hands up. They must have gotten tired too, but they stayed like that until the battle was over. Sometimes, when you step in to help your leader's weakness, others might laugh at you and even call you names. However, you must not fail your leader; you must take whatever comes with helping out. <br>It is a terrible thing when followers take advantage of their leader's weaknesses. Some followers, because their leader doesn't know how to keep track of money, start stealing from the accounts instead of helping to manage them. Some others tell people about their leaders' weaknesses to discredit them. If there is someone in the Bible that every follower should study, it is David. Even though he had already been anointed as the next king of Israel in 1 Samuel 16:13 and had done many exploits (1 Samuel 17:48-51, 1 Samuel 18:5-7), even though he had seen Saul's weaknesses (1 Samuel 16:23), he remained loyal and never discredited the king. While running for his life because Saul was trying to kill him, he got the opportunity to kill Saul but didn't do it (1 Samuel 24:4-13) – that is a good follower! As a result, he not only fulfilled his destiny, but the King of kings, who is also called the Son of David, came from his lineage (Revelation 22:16).",

      "Many people talk about leadership, but you hardly hear them talk about followership. The truth is, no leader can succeed without good followers. Leaders are raised from amongst the followers, so the better the followers, the better the quality of leaders.<br> Submission is one of the greatest attributes that a follower can have. It is different from cooperation. You cooperate when you agree with a leader's instructions, but you are submissive when you obey, whether you agree with the instruction or not. Not being submissive indicates that a follower is acting in his or her own interest rather than the interest of the entire group that the leader represents. Some followers steal because they are ready to sacrifice the interest of the entire group to satisfy their personal interests. If this behaviour continues unchecked and the follower eventually becomes a leader, he or she will only care about himself or herself. <br>Gehazi showed this in 2 Kings 5:20-27. Elisha had collected nothing from Naaman for curing his leprosy, but Gehazi was after his personal interest as opposed to that of the Lord, which his master represented. He proceeded to collect gifts from Naaman and was immediately struck with leprosy. Judas Iscariot was also recorded to have been stealing from the ministry's purse (John 12:6). This is why he could not be amongst the apostles to carry the gospel around the world after Jesus left. Such a person will never make a good leader because his or her personal interest will be more important than common interests. <br>Some people may say, “I don't steal, I just disobey my leader because I don't like him.” This is, however, just as bad as stealing. In Matthew 25:24-30, the servant who was given one talent to trade with did not steal the talent, he hid it rather than trade with it as instructed because he did not like his master's leadership style. The master wasn't annoyed that he did not trade with it as instructed, but that he could have at least put it in the bank to yield some interest. Putting it in the bank would have shown that even though he did not like his master, he was interested in the company's prosperity. This made his master call him an unfaithful servant. He was more particular about himself, which is a bad trait for any follower or leader. <br>Beloved, if you want to be a good leader, you must first be a good follower by obeying your leader and putting common interests above yours.",

      "Faith comes through God's word (Romans 10:17). The more you study God's word, the greater your faith becomes. Also, when God speaks to you directly, your faith increases. For example, when Abraham heard God speak to Him directly about having many children, it stirred up his faith (Genesis 15:5-6). There is great power in studying the word of God and in hearing His voice. <br>When I asked God for a small apartment in a suburb of Lagos, He told me that He would give me a city instead. This sounded ridiculous, but hearing it from Him directly built up so much faith in me that I started telling people what God told me. For your faith to really grow, don't just study the word and pray; seek to hear from God concerning your life. Once you hear Him give you a promise, His voice will cause a surge in your faith. <br>Furthermore, just as you grow your muscles through physical exercise, grow your faith by exercising it as well. If you believe God for something and don't make any move in line with what you believe, your faith will never grow. When I decided to believe that paying tithes would bring me blessings, I took action to pay my tithes. I discovered that God supernaturally improved my finances after doing that. Immediately, my faith grew. I then knew, without any doubt, that paying tithes attracts God's blessings, but I didn't get to that level of faith until I had acted on the little faith I had initially. As you believe God for little things and see them fulfilled, your faith will grow for big things. Act your faith; dare to do things that are greater than your human capacity, knowing that you serve a limitless God. Jump and let Him catch you. The more you do this and succeed, the stronger your faith will be. <br>Lastly, testimonies will also grow your faith. Hearing someone's testimony builds faith in you to know that God can also move on your behalf. Many people have testified at our Holy Ghost Services that they got their miracle because they heard someone else' testimony. I started operating in divine health when I heard the testimony of a man that was bent double whom God healed completely. From that testimony, I knew that God can heal all diseases, so I trusted Him completely with my health. Listen to more testimonies; purposely search for testimonies of people who have gone through what you are going through. As you hear their testimonies, your faith will rise, and you will also get your miracle.",

      "When you're baptised in the Holy Spirit, it might seem like nothing has changed about you, but the reality is, you have become very dangerous to the enemy and his cohorts. In 2 Kings 1:9- 12, Elijah was not looking dangerous; he had no weapon in his hands and was not wearing a warrior's attire. However, the captains and soldiers that were sent to arrest him never lived to tell the story. You may look the same to your enemies, but the moment you are baptised with the Holy Ghost and fire, if they try to touch you, they will be consumed. <br>To become dangerous to your enemies, ensure that you carry the fire of God inside you in great measure. For over 13 years, I never went to my village because witches and wizards had threatened to deal with me. I became born again, and not long after I was baptised with the Holy Spirit and fire, I received an invitation to attend a programme in the village. When I told my mother about the invitation, she begged me not to go. I told her that I now carry fire and anyone who touches me will roast. She said, “But you don't look any different; you are the same Adejare that I know.” I replied, “The naked wire looks the same whether electricity is passing through it or not. However, touching it while electricity is passing through it is a suicide attempt.” I went to the village, and no witch dared to touch me. Today, I announce my arrival beforehand so they can hide before I arrive. <br>In Nigeria, after drinking a bottle of Coke, we sometimes use the empty bottle as a container for kerosene. Once the bottle has become a kerosene container, you dare not put it in your mouth again. The devil knows that once you start carrying fire, he has to step carefully around you. If he has been tormenting you, the way to get him off your shoulder is to carry the fire of God. Pray so often that the fire of God starts boiling inside you. Become addicted to praying in the Holy Ghost. As you do this, the fire of God will burn inside you, and you will become dangerous for the devil to attack. Any yoke he had previously placed on you will break completely, and you will be free from his hold. When you have the fire of God burning in your bones, you will become a threat to the devil and his demons. Are you ready to carry God's fire?",

      "We\xa0live in a world where people have learnt how to 'package' themselves to look a certain way, whereas they are not who they package themselves to be. Many years ago, when The Redeemed Christian Church of God was not as big as it is now, my mother-in-law said that it was difficult to differentiate between the pastor who was a mechanic and the one who was a lecturer in the university because they all looked alike in their suits on Sundays. However, the secret comes out on Mondays when everyone goes to their places of work. Some people know how to dress like Christians and even speak and pray like fervent Christians, but deep within them, they are unbelievers. Being in this world is like their Sunday; no one can tell the difference now. However, Monday is coming at rapture; then, the difference will be clear. Believe me, it does not matter if everyone in the world thinks that a fellow is the closest person to Jesus Christ. If he or she is not truly born again, Jesus will deny the fellow on the last day. <br>Jesus Christ said in Luke 5:37-38 that if you put new wine in an old wineskin, both the content and the container will be lost forever. <br><strong><em>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. </em></strong><br>You cannot call Jesus 'Lord' and keep on obeying the devil. If you do so, you are trying to put new wine (the Holy Spirit) into an old wineskin (your sinful heart), which will only result in destruction at the end of the day. <br>Some people can deceive the whole world with their container, but that will only put them in more trouble because it will become more difficult for them to get on the right track with God. Many pastors have gone to hell because when they realised that they should genuinely give their lives to Christ, they were too ashamed to come out for an altar call or make restitution for the things they had done while they were pretending. Don't pretend to be a Christian; genuinely give your life to Christ if you haven't done so and live a holy life henceforth",

      "If you have elders around you, you have rare wisdom around you, and you should learn from their wealth of wisdom. There are certain things that elders know that Google, as vast as it is, does not know. The elders have some alternative treatments for sicknesses and diseases that modern science has not caught up with yet. There are some experiences that they have when it comes to relating with other people that you cannot learn in any book or university. If you take care of your elders and learn from them, there is a lot you will know and have as an advantage over your peers. In Yorubaland, when we see a child behaving wisely, we call him or her Omo Agba meaning the child of an elder, because we know straight away that he or she must have learnt a lot from an elderly person. <br>With all of Moses' education in Egypt, the greatest nation in those days, his father-in-law, Jethro, was the one who taught him a valuable lesson about delegation. Moses got the best leadership education in the world and thought he was a good leader until he was exposed to an elder's wisdom. Jethro's counsel showed him that he was not that wise after all. You may think you are wise because you are educated and have the internet at your fingertips, but if you listen to the elders, you will discover a lot of truth that will really help you in life. <br>When an elder advises you, take that advice dearly because what you do with it could be the difference between success and failure. In 1 Kings 12:6, King Rehoboam met with elders on how to rule the people. They gave him advice which was filled with wisdom. However, he went to meet his younger friends for advice, and because theirs seemed more exciting, he pushed aside the advice of the elders. Rehoboam's actions caused a civil war, and he lost the kingdom of Israel, as we see in verses 18 and 19: <br><strong><em>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</em></strong> <br>Never despise the advice of godly elders.",

      "Nowadays, many young people think that they are superior to elders because they believe they are more sophisticated. An elder is an elder, regardless of their educational, financial, and/or social status. People must always honour elders if they don't want curses on their heads (Deuteronomy 27:16). <br>Today's memory verse says that when you see an elder coming, you must rise up in honour of the elder. Don't let an elder pass by you without greeting them. If an elder is carrying something, you must run to them and help with whatever they are carrying. When an elder is talking to you, don't talk back immediately; let the elder finish speaking before you speak. Take a cue from Elihu in Job 32:4: <br><strong><em>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. </em></strong><br>Furthermore, in Job 32:6, Elihu did not just share his opinion; he spoke with honour to the elders, telling them that he was afraid to speak because he was before them. In verse 8, you will see that Elihu was the one who spoke the words that we often quote, “There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives him understanding.” Clearly, he was wise and had understanding from God. You cannot claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit and dishonour your elders; that would be a lie. <br>Now you may say, what if an elder has done something terrible that is not expected from elders? The Bible says in 1 Timothy 5:1-3 that you must never rebuke an elder. It may surprise you to know that when Elihu did the things I referred to in the previous paragraph, he was very angry with the elders. He was angry with Job because Job was self-righteous, justifying himself rather than God. Yet, he waited for him to finish speaking before sharing his opinion with honour. Don't say you have holy anger and speak to an elder disrespectfully. Don't claim to be fighting for God and dishonour an elder. No matter how wrong an elder is, you must share your opinion respectfully and never dishonour them.",

Likewise, your children are to go ahead of you into your future to make it more pleasurable. If you train your children well, when they are older, they will take care of you in your old age. <br>My mother and father did not have formal education. My family was called poor, even by the poor people in our village. The day my father bought an umbrella, we all celebrated in our house; that is how poor we were. However, even though we were very poor, my parents managed to send me to school. They sold their properties till there was nothing else to sell. That was the best decision they ever took because sending me to school brought the family out of poverty. Today, the name 'Adeboye' is known around the world because my parents used the money from selling their properties to pay my school fees. <br>Spend your money wisely; invest in your children because they are the arrows you will send to your future. They will be there for you when you are old, and when you are long gone, the results of your investment in them will still be obvious. There is an adage in Yorubaland that says that if you decide to build a house rather than build your child, the child you refused to build will sell off the house you built. <br>Choose to send your children to the best schools you can afford. Choose to spend quality time with them to teach them the basic principles of life and God's word. No investment in your children ever expires. Ecclesiastes 7:8 says that better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof. It is better to wear rags now and train your children than to wear the best clothes and leave your children untrained. It doesn't matter what you wear today; if your children are well-trained, they will buy you the best clothes and cars and even build houses for you when they get older. <br>Beloved, training your children well is important if you want to enjoy long-term prosperity and peace of mind.",

If a believer does not want God to destroy him or her, he or she must avoid fornication by all means. When fornication comes knocking on the door of your heart, you must flee! <br>How do you flee fornication? First, stay away from anything that can lead to fornication. Don't stay in secluded places alone with someone of the opposite sex. Don't have immoral conversations with that fellow who claims to be your friend because evil communication corrupts good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33). If someone is making sexual advances at you, run! Don't give room for the fellow to try and convince you at all. When Potiphar's wife was trying to get Joseph to sleep with her, he ran for his dear life (Genesis 39:7-12). <br>Beloved, there is no point in Christians entering into romantic relationships if the mutual intention is not marriage – a relationship like that is a time bomb, waiting to blow up its participants. If you cannot tell your pastor that you want to go into a relationship with someone, then you must not go into that relationship. A child of God should not have casual romantic relationships, rather, he or she should have a fiancé or fiancée. <br>If you are mature enough to get married, and the desire to have sexual relations is getting so much that it is difficult to cope, then get married. God sanctions sexual relations only within the confines of marriage. To avoid the destruction that comes with fornication, it is better that you get married. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 7:9, “But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.” <br>There is absolutely nothing worthwhile to gain or enjoy from fornicating; the result is always destruction.

Any marriage where the husband and wife compete against each other will not stand because Mark 3:25 says that a house divided against itself shall not stand. Husband, your wife is a gift from God to help you achieve His purpose for your life. You must create the environment that encourages her to help you rather than compete with you. If not for my wife's help and the grace of God, I would not have achieved all I have achieved in ministry today. Ask God to give you the wisdom to know what to do to get your spouse to help you. <br>I always encourage and give room for my wife to help me. I don't hide things from her, rather, I hand some things over to her to handle. After major programmes like our annual conventions, I buy her gifts to say, “Thank you for your support.” This encourages her to help me more in subsequent programmes. <br>Wives, stop trying to compete with your husbands. Don't follow the recent worldly trend that is seeking to overturn the roles of husbands and wives in marriages. Don't turn your marriage into a competition where there is a winner and a loser. One person's win is a win for both of you. The more impact your spouse makes, the prouder you should be. In Proverbs 31:23, the Bible says that a good wife makes her husband proud. Husband, if your wife is making an impact in places of authority, you should hold your head up high; it does not reduce you as a man; it enhances you. It shows that you know how to nurture talent well, and things flourish in your hands. <br>Let all involved parties play their part in ensuring a successful home. If every footballer on a field tries to be the striker so that they can boast of the number of goals they score, who will be the goalkeeper and ensure that the opponent doesn't score against them? The fact that you are a defender does not make you any less valuable than the striker. Play your part, and you will both enjoy the rewards of success.

The people who attempted to stone the adulterous woman in John 8:1-11 were just like this. They did not expect that Jesus would put the searchlight of righteousness on them; He humiliated them as they planned to humiliate her. <br>When we correct someone just to show how righteous we are, we are attacking their self-esteem, adding to the weight of guilt they already bear, and making it more difficult for them to come to Christ. God turns against people who condemn others to prove that they are righteous. When Jesus sees a fallen soldier in His army, He wants to help the fellow up. If He discovers that other soldiers are throwing stones at the fellow to kill him or her completely, He turns against those soldiers to defend the one who is wounded. <br>It is unfortunate that many Christians use their superiority complex to hand their own brothers and sisters over to the devil. For example, who is a young Christian girl supposed to turn to if she becomes pregnant out of wedlock? Fellow believers or unbelievers? In most cases, her church members might call her a prostitute and make her feel unwanted, while unbelievers may show her care and understanding. When soldiers are wounded, they need people to help them dress their wounds so they can stand up again. If the people they get help from are from the enemy's camp, they may never return to their own camp again. This is why many backsliders keep going deeper into sin. They think that they will no longer find forgiveness and acceptance in the church, so they backslide completely. The Holy Spirit is still drawing them toward the church, but they are reluctant to go back out of the fear of being condemned by the people who should show love to them the most. <br>Beloved, if a fellow believer falls, don't condemn the person. Don't turn such a person into an object of gossip, rather, get other Christians together to pray and follow up on the fellow until he or she comes back to God.

This is a law that cannot be broken. <br>When my father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, was alive, he used to say that it is what your father has that he will use to take care of you. Romans 6:16 says that whomever a person yields himself or herself to obey is that fellow's master.

      "The law of association is a very powerful law that every human being on earth must understand and apply correctly. This law is subtle in its operation, and many people don't realise when it is working on them. They don't realise that the people they often speak to, greatly influence the way they think and act. This law states that an individual becomes like the people he or she associates with. In other words, if a fellow associates with wise people, he or she will become wise. Likewise, if the fellow associates with foolish people, he or she will become foolish. It is stated clearly in Proverbs 13:20: <br><strong><em>He that walks with the wise shall be wise but the companion of fools shall be destroyed. </em></strong><br>The elders in Yorubaland usually say, “When a leaf stays long with a soap, it will also become a soap.” You must carefully choose the people you associate with. If your friend is not someone you admire and want to be like, you should unfriend that fellow immediately. Be friends with wise people that can challenge you, people you can discuss great ideas with. Don't be friends with people who gossip and are only interested in entertainment when you are together. <br>Another form of association is with the media. Some people spend a lot of time watching television and scrolling through social media. Whatever you read or watch has a great influence on who you become. If you read and watch inspiring things, they will inspire you to become great. Anyone who reads and watches immoral content will eventually become corrupt, as we can see in our memory verse for today. <br>What kind of content do you constantly consume? Whose content are you consuming on social media? Whose music do you listen to? These things are a pointer to who you are becoming. When you want to change something about yourself, change the people you associate with. If you want to get better with your academics, keep company with brilliant people and learn from those who have excelled academically, and you will see your grades get better. If you want to be more fervent in your Christian life, find friends who read their Bibles, and pray regularly. Soon, you will also be doing the same. <br>Examine the kind of friends you keep and the kinds of content you consume. Are they a reflection of who you want to become?

      "The law of unity is one of the most amazing laws that God set up on the earth. The Bible states that one will chase a thousand and two will chase ten thousand (Deuteronomy 32:30). This doesn't make any sense mathematically, but I have found it to be true. <br>Jesus said in Matthew 18:19 that if two people shall agree concerning a thing, it shall be done by His Father in heaven. In other words, if you have prayed and are yet to get an answer, find someone to agree with you in prayers, and you will receive the answer. In Psalms 133:1-2, the unity amongst brethren is likened to the anointing. Unity is a very powerful force; it is so powerful that even the Holy Spirit did not descend until the disciples were in one accord in the Upper Room (Acts 2:1-4). There are certain things you will never achieve until you apply the law of unity to it. A husband and wife who are always fighting are denying themselves of many great things. If they can only humble themselves, resolve their differences, and agree as one, they will become a great force against all their problems, and there will be nothing beyond their reach. Church members who are always gossiping about each other or quarrelling amongst themselves don't know what they are losing. <br>In our Bible reading for today, some people came together to build a tower that would reach heaven. God saw them and said that they would achieve their goal because they were united. This was thousands of years ago when there was hardly any technology. In other words, God was saying that even without adequate resources, unity alone was enough for those people to build such a tower. <br>In the early days of RCCG, we had no money. We didn't even have money to pay all the staff, but we were very united. As a result, we did many great things, including building the biggest auditorium of that time. There is absolutely no gain in being divided. Matthew 12:25 says a house divided against itself shall not stand. Whenever the devil wants to destroy a move of God or hinder Christians from achieving something, he sows discord amongst them. <br>One of the many reasons I bless God for the wife He gave to me is that she is always facilitating unity everywhere she goes. She is always bringing people together; never allowing disunity in any group she belongs. Even with my extended family, she is a binding force. She will never allow anybody carry a long face around her, whatever the problem is must be solved before anybody goes to bed that day. That quality is a divine gift that has been a great blessing to my life and ministry. <br>Never give room for disunity. Don't let the devil win; don't allow disunity.",

In other words, nothing moves until someone moves it. <br>An individual's career will not move forward without deliberate efforts to advance it, neither will a marriage be automatically blissful without some effort from both parties. A believer's spiritual life will not blossom unless he or she puts in the required work. Nothing goes for nothing. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says that those who don't work should not eat. Some people feel that because they have certain gifts and talents, things will always be good for them – that is a big lie. One of my sons often says that hard work will beat talent if talent doesn't work hard. <br>In Matthew 25:14–30, the Master gave His servants some talents with a simple instruction, “Trade with it.” You cannot leave your talent(s) dormant if you want to be fruitful. You must work on your talent(s) if you want positive results. The servant that did not work on his talent was punished greatly. If a believer does not work on whatever God has given to him or her, such a fellow will be greatly punished in the end. <br>One day, I met a pastor who started out in ministry at around the same time as me, and he said, “God has really been good to you.” I agree, God has been very good to me. It is only by His grace that I have come this far. However, nobody can accuse me of being lazy. When I was starting out, God gave me prophecies, gifts of the Spirit and talents, but all these things would have gone to waste if I did not work hard. In fact, the more resources God gives you, the harder you must work because Luke 12:48 says that to whom much is given, much is expected. <br>Brethren, if a person is not ready to work, then he or she is not ready to succeed at anything in life. Nothing will excuse anyone from the effects of this law. Excuses are for failures. No matter the excuse you may want to give for not being productive, it will never suffice as there are people who have experienced greater challenges and surmounted them. Great achievers put excuses aside, get to work, and make the best out of whatever situations they find themselves in. <br>Get up and work.",

      "After creation, God rested on the seventh day (Genesis 2:2). How is it that the Almighty, All-powerful God needed to rest? He did not need to rest; He can never be tired. If He had been tired, then He would have been tired at least once in all the thousands of years since the earth was made. Psalms 121:4 says that He never sleeps nor slumbers. Therefore, resting on the seventh day was not for Him but for us; He was establishing a law that we should follow for our own good – the law of rest (Exodus 34:21). <br>The law of rest is to be applied to your land, animals, and staff. You must not let your staff work for seven days a week; they must have at least one day to rest and be refreshed (Exodus 23:12). This is important for them to be productive the next week. Also, you will get the best out of your farmland if you leave it to rest for one year every seven years (Leviticus 25:4). It is a law that will increase your productivity greatly. <br>If you think that working for seven days will bring more productivity than working for six days every week, you are wrong. There is a fast-food restaurant in the United States of America that works for only six days and is closed on Sundays. That restaurant is one of the fastest\x02growing fast-food restaurants in the world. Resting for one day every week greatly improves your productivity as opposed to working for seven days a week. <br>Working continuously without rest will damage an individual's health. Many people have died because they did not rest as they ought to. Going against this law can bring great danger to a fellow's health and life. I was telling one of my sons about this law of rest, and he looked at me in a funny way as if to say, “You? Do you rest?” I told him that I rest, even though he may not know it. I wouldn't be this productive if I don't rest. In fact, there are periods in the year when I don't go anywhere; I just stay in a quiet place to rest. My body will no longer be useful to God if I damage it just because I am so zealous about the ministry that I disregard the law of rest.",

      "The law of priority states that if you put the right thing first, everything else will fall in place. Jesus clearly stated the law of priority in Matthew 6:33. When a person seeks other things above God, such a fellow will struggle, but if he or she seeks God first, other things will be added unto him or her. <br>What you prioritise determines the quality of your life. When you receive your first harvest in any field, you must take it to God. This is a sign that you honour and put Him first, and as such, other harvests will be secure (Proverbs 3:9-10). <br>Many people put money before God; this is why they experience sorrows that money cannot solve. Some wealthy people cannot sleep at night, and will gladly trade their wealth to have peace and joy. The problem is usually what or whom they prioritise. The rich man in Matthew 19:16-22 knew that something was missing in his life. He had been obeying the law and had lots of money, but he felt incomplete. He met Jesus for a solution and was told that his problem was with his priorities; he prioritised money above following Jesus. <br>If God tells you to sell all you have, forget about your dreams, and go into full-time ministry, will you do it? Your answer will determine if you prioritise Him or not. When you check through the Scriptures, those who prioritised God were greatly rewarded. For example, the blessings of Abraham exist today because He prioritised God over everything, even his own son (Genesis 21:10). I am a living example of the benefits of prioritising God. I left my thriving career in academics and my dream of becoming the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa to become the General Overseer over a church whose monthly income was less than my salary because God said so. Today, the name Adeboye is known all around the world because I prioritised God above my dreams. <br>God is a jealous God (Exodus 34:14); He cannot take second place in your heart. Whatever or whomever you prioritise above God has become a god to you. God said that you should have no other god before Him (Exodus 20:3). You must love Him with all your heart, soul and mind; this is the greatest and foremost commandment (Matthew 22:37-38). When you do this, everything else will fall into place in your life.

      "Today, I will conclude my teaching on the law of harvest. As a mathematician, I learned early that laws only stand when certain conditions are present. For example, the law of gravity simply states that when you throw an object up, it will fall to the ground. When the conditions present favour the law of aerodynamics, the law of gravity, as powerful as it is, will not hold. <br>For any law to stand, some conditions must be met. Yesterday, I discussed how powerful the law of harvest is, but in spite of its power, it will only stand when you sow under the right conditions. First, you must sow on good ground. I mentioned earlier this month when I was discussing the series, 'Return on Seeds', that I sowed multiple times into a ministry abroad many years ago, but got no harvest. God showed me in a dream that I had been sowing on hard ground. Some ministries and ministers are not linked to God. When you sow into them, you might think you are giving God an offering, but it never gets to Him because they are hard grounds. This is why you must be sure of the places you sow your seeds. Matthew 10:41 says that when you give to a prophet, you will get a prophet's reward. Some people claim to be prophets, but God does not recognise them at all. Discern before you sow. <br>Also, don't sow grudgingly. If you sow as if you are being forced to sow, God will not accept your offering. 2 Corinthians 9:7 says that He loves a cheerful giver. You may sow sacrificially, such that it is so hard for you to release the seed and you shed tears while doing so, but you must never sow grudgingly; you must sow from a willing heart. <br>Years ago, I was at a service, and the people conducting the service were calling for multiple offerings. I became angry, and as I wanted to bring out an offering, God told me, “I don't want your money.” I immediately repented and changed my perception. God is not a beggar. If you bring an offering to Him grudgingly, it may enter the offering basket, but God will not accept it, and you will reap nothing from it. <br>Beloved, for you to make the law of harvest work in your life, ask God to show you a good land where you can sow and when you find it, make sure you sow willingl",

      "The law of harvest is one of the strongest laws that God placed on earth. It is so powerful that God Himself will never break it. In Mark 14:36, Jesus Christ prayed fervently, sweating blood and praying that God should change the plan of salvation so that He wouldn't have to go to the cross to die for mankind. God said 'No!' He said ‘no’ because of the law of harvest; He had to sow His only Son in order to reap many more children into His kingdom (Romans 8:29, Hebrews 2:10, 1 Corinthians 15:20). <br>The law of harvest states that whatever a man sows, he will reap. This is well captured in Galatians 6:7:<br><strong><em> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. </em></strong><br>Another beautiful thing about the law of harvest is that you will reap what you sow in greater proportions (Hosea 8:7). Therefore, whenever you give an offering or give alms, you are sowing a seed, and whatever you have given will come back to you in multiple folds. This is a law that nothing can break. <br>The law of harvest becomes much stronger when operated in two ways. The first is the law of firstfruit, while the second is the law of tithes. These two laws open the possibility of overflowing blessings. There are only two places in the Bible where God says that if you do something, He will bless you so much that there won't be enough room to take it (Proverbs 3:9-10 and Malachi 3:10). These two passages show us clearly the secret of overflowing blessings. <br>Many times, when people pray for overflowing blessings, God expects them to obey the laws of firstfruits and tithes so that they can receive the blessings they seek. Believers will stop struggling with their finances when they obey the divine law of harvest in their work, business, and in giving. <br>The Almighty God Himself put the law of harvest in place and expects us to obey it. For example, when I was first told about tithing, it didn't make sense to me mathematically, but I obeyed. I wondered back then, if one hundred per cent was not enough to take care of my needs, how can ninety per cent be sufficient after taking out ten per cent as tithe? Thank God I decided to test the law of tithing, and, to my surprise, I discovered that it was true.",

      "Kings usually get the best of everything. Our God is the King of kings, and He wants everyone who surrenders to Him to be the best. To achieve this, God passes them through a refining process to make them the best that they can ever be. Just like a goldsmith puts gold through fire for it to come out purer, God will take you through a refining fire for you to come out purer and better. Are you willing to go through the refining fire of God?<br> In John 15:2, He said: <br><strong><em>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit</em></strong>. <br>If you want to be a branch that is connected to the vine and bear fruits for God, you must be ready to go through a pruning process. It will be tough, but it will make you more fruitful. <br>In the pruning process, God will take away things that are competing with Him from your heart. He may ask you to stop wearing jewellery, not necessarily because it is a sin to wear them, but because they may be a distraction to your fruitfulness. He may allow persecution to arise against you so that you will draw closer to Him. As you draw closer to Him, you will become more like Him and be more fruitful. He might hold some things back from you for a while to test your faith, so that you can become perfect, wanting nothing (James 1:2-4). <br>At the end of the refining process, you will become so valuable that people will run over each other to favour you. Just like everyone wants gold in its purest form, you will become a spectacle to your generation. As everyone wants the best of fruits, you will have people from all over the world coming to glean from the great value that you possess. Those who successfully go through the pruning process of God become superstars in their generation because they carry great value that the whole world wants to glean from. They are problem solvers, and people see them as blessings. Money is never their problem because their value attracts money from all around the world. They don't beg for doors to open to them, their names open doors. Are you ready to be refined by God?",

      "The first time I read 1 Kings 3:4-15 after being born again, I thought to myself, “How did Solomon think of offering God a thousand burnt offerings?” This made me carry out a background check, and I discovered a secret. In 2 Samuel 12:24-25, the Bible tells us that God loved Solomon as soon as he was born. His father named him Solomon, but God named him Jedidiah, meaning beloved of the Lord. Because God loved Solomon, He wanted an opportunity to bless him in a way that nobody would be able to query Him, so He set him up by putting it in his heart to do something nobody had ever done before. That way, He also could do for Solomon what He had never done for anyone before. <br>When I joined RCCG in 1973, when there was any need in the church, they would ask only the children of God to wait behind. In those days, children of God meant those that are truly born again and know it. One day, my wife and I waited behind, and the General Superintendent said, “We have an urgent need that must be met this week. Every one of you should go and close your bank accounts and bring whatever money you have there to the church.” On Monday, my wife and I closed our savings accounts and took the money to church. The following Sunday, the General Superintendent said again that the children of God should wait behind. We waited. He announced that the need had been met, and we all rejoiced. Then he asked the question, “How many of you closed your accounts as I instructed?” My wife and I raised our hands, and when we looked around, no other hand was raised. Immediately, I thought to myself, “I hope I am not going crazy with this Christianity of mine.” Then, God spoke to me, “Son, you are not mad. I am allowing you to do what others have not done so that when I take you to where I am taking you, nobody will be able to query me.” The rest is history; it was a divine setup. <br>When God places it in your heart to give Him something, He is only setting you up for greatness.

If a doctor says your case is hopeless, He that sits in the heavens shall laugh because He already settled your healing thousands of years ago by His stripes (Isaiah 53:5).

      "Over the last two days, I have discussed how you can get harvests from the seeds you sow. Today, I will focus on seeds that are sown based on God's instructions. These kinds of seeds go beyond yielding 100- fold, they yield unlimited returns. In 1 Kings 17:8-16, when Elijah told the widow to bring her last meal and she obeyed, the result was an unlimited supply of food for her household all through the famine. When God instructs you to give and you obey, He pours unlimited blessings on you.<br>When I became the General Overseer of RCCG, the entire monthly income of the church was less than my monthly salary as a lecturer before I resigned. By the time we managed to pay the salaries of the staff, there was usually nothing left for me. Things were tough, and I looked forward to collecting my gratuity because I had served the government for many years. My plan was to invest part of the money and save some, hoping that before I finished spending my savings, the church would have grown to the point where I could start getting paid a salary. When the gratuity came in, I remembered that God was now my Commander-in-Chief, so I asked Him how to spend the money. To my surprise, He said that I should divide it into three parts and give each part to different ministries. Nothing was to come to the ministry I was heading, even though we had needs. I trembled when He gave me that instruction, but then, He followed it with, “I will be your source.” I obeyed, and since then, He has truly been my source. <br>In Malachi 3:10, God instructed that you should bring ten per cent of your income into His storehouse, and He will open the windows of heaven and pour down blessings that you will not have enough room to contain. This is an unlimited blessing that comes from obeying just one instruction. God blessed Abraham and told him that He will be his reward (Genesis 15:1). Imagine God Himself being someone's reward; that is an unlimited blessing. When you check what preceded that, you will discover that this blessing came after Abraham paid the first ever tithe to Melchizedek in Genesis 14:18-20. Your tithe is a major door to the unlimited blessings of God. <br>When God instructs you to give, it is an opportunity for you to experience unlimited blessings from Him.

      "Yesterday, I discussed the importance of ensuring that you are sowing on good soil. Today, I will examine the returns to be expected from seeds even when they are planted on good soils. First, let us focus on sowing into a man of God's life.<br><strong><em> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. </em></strong><strong><em> Mathew 10:41</em></strong><br> The spiritual hierarchy of the man of God you are sowing into will determine the level of the returns you will get from your seeds. Some seeds will yield 30-fold, some 60- fold and some 100-fold. Your seeds might be planted on good soil, but the richer the soil, the more the yield will be. In other words, the greater the spiritual height the fellow has reached, the greater the yield when you sow into his or her life. This is not to say that you should only sow into the lives of big men of God. In fact, there are some so-called 'small' men of God who have gone deeper in spiritual things than the popular ones; popularity is not a test of spirituality. Yes, it is good to sow into the lives of Bishops, General Overseers and Senior Pastors, but you must also not neglect the pastor that is close to you today, especially when God instructs you to do so.<br> I must mention here that your seeds are really sown to honour God and not any man. You can only sow through a man of God, but the one you are really giving to is the God that the man represents. Thus, if you only sow into the lives of those you have identified as big men of God, you are clearly trying to manipulate God, and God cannot be manipulated. All His children have needs, and if it is Him you really care about when sowing your seeds, then you will sow everywhere you know that He wants to meet a need. <br>In Galatians 6:10, the Bible says that we should do good unto all men, especially those of the household of faith. Don't ignore the brother who is wearing a worn-out shoe to church while you go about changing the entire wardrobe of your pastor.

      "In finance, there is something called<strong> Return on Investment.</strong> Likewise, in the kingdom of God, there is something I'll like to call <strong>Return on Seeds.</strong> This is the profit you make when a seed is sown in the kingdom of God. According to today's Bible reading, there is the possibility of having a zero return on seeds sown, or a 30, 60 or 100-fold return. Also, as you will learn later in this series, there is the possibility of having an unlimited return on your seeds. <br>Two things determine your return on seeds: the first is what is left with you after sowing. In other words, how sacrificial is your seed? The second is the soil on which you sowed. Today, I will focus on the kind of soil that brings zero return on seeds. <br>Many years ago, I was sowing seeds into a ministry abroad. I knew about the law of harvest, so I kept sowing. However, nothing was coming forth. I became worried, and so I started to ask God what was happening. Then, I had a dream. In the dream, I was standing on a farmland with heaps that showed that things had been sown on that land. I lifted one of the heaps, and underneath it was solid concrete. This meant that nothing could grow on that land. When I woke up, I knew the meaning of the dream – the ministry I had been sowing into was as good as concrete ground; no seed will yield returns when sown there. <br>If you sow a seed in a place that God does not approve of, your seed will yield no return. God cares about the poor, therefore, when you sow into their lives, Psalms 41:1 says that He will deliver you in the day of trouble. God cares about His prophets and ministers, so when you sow into their lives, you will get a reward (Matthew 10:41-42). God cares about His Church, so when you sow into a ministry, you will be rewarded (Malachi 3:10-12). If the place you sow into only looks like a ministry from the outside but is devoid of God's presence, then your seeds will yield zero returns. You can decide to give anybody money if you wish, but if it is a seed, ensure that you are sowing in a place or a person that God is interested in. <br>Don't sow your seeds on concrete and expect a return, it will not yield anything.",

I am praying for you today, that the Almighty God will cause you to hear from Him more clearly. When God begins to talk to you about what He wants to do, it shows that you have become His friend. In John 15:15, Jesus Christ said to His disciples: <strong><em>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. </em></strong><br><br>God said concerning Abraham that He could not hide whatever He was about to do from him. God is sovereign, He doesn't need permission from anybody to do anything, but there are certain people He must talk to before He does anything. You must sit down and really assess your relationship with God and become so close to Him that you can hear from Him yourself. You need to get to that stage where He will not hide anything from you. When you read Genesis 18, you will discover that Abraham was a friend of God. That was why God never hid anything from Him. Abraham wasn't just God's friend, Romans 4:16 describes him as the father of faith. Since without faith, it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6), Abraham being the father of faith means that he really pleased God. <br><br>You can get so close to God that He will tell you His secrets; things He won't tell anyone else. In John 13:21-26, everyone at the table asked Jesus about who will betray Him. He did not answer them, but He answered one fellow who was His favourite – John the Beloved. <br><br>It is such a beautiful thing to be able to tell anyone, no matter who they are, “God did not say that.” It shows that you are so special to God that if He is to talk to anyone, He will talk to you. For example, in 1 Kings 22:6-28, many prophets prophesied falsehood, but Micaiah, who heard from God directly, stood out and spoke the mind of God and it came to pass. If you are close to God, you cannot be deceived by anyone. I pray for you that soon, God will be sharing His secrets with you, in Jesus’ name",

      "Today's topic is a question you must be conscious of. In today's Bible reading, Jesus asked His disciples whom people said that He was. He wasn't confused about His identity; He knew who He was, but He was concerned about how people perceived Him. You must be conscious of how people perceive you too. People will only relate with you based on what they think about you and not what you think about yourself. <br><br>When my father in the Lord was alive, company executives would come to him for his opinion whenever they needed to hire staff for their company. They would say things like, “Sir, Brother so and so in your church has applied for a role in our company, what do you think about him?” Sometimes, he would cleverly reply, “That brother? Well, he says he is a Christian.” However, when they ask about someone who is truly born again, he will say, “That brother is a Christian.” There is a difference between who you claim to be and who you really are. <br><br>There are two kinds of people whose perception of you, you must take seriously. The first are people who know you but are not in your inner circle. They may not be close to you, but they are observant. They can build a perception about you from the things you say and do. Their perception may not be true, but as far as they are concerned, that is the true you. Therefore, you should endeavour not to make a mistake that will give them a wrong impression of you. <br><br>The second set of people are those in your inner circle. In today's Bible reading, the fellow who knew the real identity of Jesus was one of the people in His inner circle – Simon Peter. This tells us clearly that those who know us the best are the ones closest to us. Who does your spouse say you are? What about your children? These people know you more than anyone else, and their opinion must be very valuable to you. I have always said it, the reason some ministers' children are wayward is because they know who their parents are. They hear them preach one thing on the altar but see them do something else at home. This confuses them and draws them far from the God their parents claim to serve. You can pretend to people outside, but you cannot pretend to your family members.",

      "On earth, every government, ministry or industry has a leader who can be likened to a king sitting on a throne. Today's memory verse says that when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice. In other words, when things are going wrong, it is likely that it is not a righteous person bearing rule. The reason we have policies that clearly go against God's ways is that the people bearing rule and establishing such policies are not righteous. We have industries, political parties, and the likes that are obviously corrupt because the thrones in such places are occupied by unrighteous people; that is about to come to an end! Believers have to do what it takes to take thrones for God. <br>I was quite close to a king in Western Nigeria before he died. We were so close that on one occasion, I slept in his palace. Because of how close we were, he got some of the anointing that God put upon me, so before he died, he made a decree. He did not want the people of his kingdom to go back to idol worship after his demise, so he decreed that anyone who is not born again would not sit on the throne again. It has been well over 20 years and even though there have been people that are keenly interested in the throne and some that have been chosen to sit on it, up till now, no one has occupied that throne. He took the throne for God completely so that his kingdom will only serve the living God. You can do the same, you can take the thrones of the places you operate in for God. <br>Yes, you can take thrones for God by declarations. However, it is easier to dedicate thrones to God permanently when you are the one sitting on them. This means that you must work hard and strive to reach the top so that you can sit on thrones. Once you sit on a throne, you can sanitize the entire place spiritually, and take it over for God permanently. I pray that the grace to reach the top in your fields of operation will be released unto you, in Jesus' name. God will use you to take thrones from the devil's hands, in Jesus' name. Because of you, evil policies and corrupt practices will be abolished, in Jesus' name.",

      "Looking at today's topic, I'm sure you're asking yourself, 'How did the Father send me?' Acts 10:38 says that Jesus was sent to do good and to heal all that were oppressed of the devil, but then, He was anointed with the Holy Ghost and power for that assignment. That's why, concerning His ministers, Jesus said in Luke 24:49, <strong><em>“Tarry ye in Jerusalem until thou be endued with power from on high.” </em></strong><br>The condition for being a minister of God, according to Acts 6:1-3, is that you must be full of the Holy Spirit. Being baptised in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is good. However, other kinds of evidence must also be there. Acts 6:8 says that Stephen, a man full of the Holy Spirit, performed miracles. Where are the miracles that God has performed through you since your baptism in the Holy Spirit? In Acts 8:5-8, Philip, one of the deacons, went to Samaria and turned a whole city upside down. In Acts 13:6-12, when Paul was preaching to a governor, and a sorcerer was trying to hinder him, Paul, full of the Holy Spirit, moved the mountain out of the way and got his victory by the power of the Holy Spirit. <br>We believers are dealing with a world called the New Age. They are working overtime to win our youths over with magic, and we need to demonstrate greater power to silence them so the youths do not give in to their devices. This power is available in God for all those who are willing to pay the price, but unfortunately, in a very subtle manner, the devil is pushing the church to lukewarmness. <br>You need to realise that whenever Jesus taught in a place, the Bible says that the power of God was always present to heal. I have discovered that when we preach about healing, God heals. When we tag a service 'deliverance night', a lot of demonised people in attendance will get delivered. We choose themes that show God that we are keenly interested in doing His works. He said that He will baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire (Luke 3:16). There is a difference between just speaking in tongues and having the fire behind your tongues. When you are baptised by the Holy Spirit and fire, it will be evident; miracles will happen, souls will be won, and the whole world will bow to our Lord. Seek the fire today!",

It is good news because all you have to do is tell Him, “I can't do it Lord, but I know you can do it through me.” There is something called 'the God Factor'. Let God do it; however, He can only do it if you are willing to cooperate. If you believe He can do it, He will do it.

Many people don't fulfil their assignments because they hardly go to God for instructions. They start the work quite alright, but they hardly pray for direction, whereas it is in the place of prayers that God will give them instructions on each step to take. They keep doing everything to make the work succeed, but when it is time to make decisions, they don't ask God for the best decisions to make. After a while, when they realise that they are not fulfilling the assignment, they accuse Him of helping others and not helping them. <br>Beloved, you cannot do anything by yourself (John 15:5).

Today, I will discuss what will really be planted into the bodies of people that receive the mark of the beast. <br>If you have been staying up to date with technology, you will have seen that technologies already exist to put microchips in people’s bodies so that with it, they can access the internet directly from their brains, make phone calls just by thinking, and have medical ‘miracles’ like healing a broken leg in record time, et cetera. From the experiments conducted with these microchips, scientists can see whatever the test subjects can see and even make them raise their hands or legs by controlling the chips from a computer. These microchips are connected directly to the brain so that whoever is controlling the microchips can control the minds of the people who have them. In other words, getting the mark means submitting yourself to the control of the government of that time. When they are in control, they can make people do whatever they want. That is why those who have the mark will be condemned because now, they cannot do the will of God as the antichrist is now in control of their minds. Getting the microchip in their bodies will seal their fate because the antichrist will control their minds to obey only him. <strong><em>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </em></strong><strong><em>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans 6:16</em></strong> <br>The devil is aware of the Scripture above and hence knows that whomever you obey is your master.

The Scriptures give us a hint in our Bible reading for today. <br>The mark of the beast can actually take different forms; it can be a mark, a name, or the number of a name. Whichever one it is, it is a representation of the beast, and whoever receives it on his forehead or right hand will be identified as a worshipper of the beast. Only such people will be allowed to buy, sell, or be a part of the society after the rapture has taken place. Anyone who refuses to get the mark of the beast will be hunted and killed. <br>Now, what really could this mark be? In the days of Apostle John, there was no technology, so he could only describe everything that he saw in his vision with the things he had seen around him. A mark that is taken on the forehead or right hand must have been imprinted by a machine, and the imprint must be something that cannot be washed off. The reason tattoos seem permanent is that they are printed on the skin. However, they become blurred over time and can even be erased with laser surgery. Since this mark is one that is so important to people's identity and life, it will not be one that can fade or be erased. This means that it will go really deep into the skin. It is likely to be an implant and not an imprint. <br>If the mark of the beast is likely to be an implant, then it means that something will be planted into the body of those who will be left behind after the rapture, and it will be a sign of worshipping the beast (Revelation 20:4). It will be a sign that tells everyone, “I am loyal to the beast, I obey him.” The implant will be used to control them and ensure that they obey the beast whether they like it or not. <br>I will discuss this further tomorrow, but I want to urge you today to surrender your life to Jesus Christ if you are yet to do so.

According to National Geographic, there are between 50 billion and 430 billion birds in the world. Clearly, there will be enough birds to eat the flesh of those who dare to fight God. <br>While those who died without the mark of the beast are raised up to reign with Christ for a thousand years, those who died while fighting Christ and His army will not be raised until the millennial reign is over (Revelation 20:5). After the armies have been destroyed, there will still be some people who are not soldiers but who have taken the mark of the beast on earth. These are the people that the saints will reign over for a thousand years. After the millennial reign, the devil will be released from his prison, and he will gather a great army to fight the saints. However, this time, the saints will not need to fight because God will send fire from heaven to devour their enemies.

Those that are left behind after the rapture have a very small chance of making it to heaven, so it will be foolish to risk missing the rapture. The first resurrection is the last chance that will be given to those who miss the rapture. <br>After the rapture has taken place and the antichrist has taken rulership over the earth, he will bring up a policy that will mandate everyone on earth to worship the beast and take the mark of the beast. The book of Revelation is written in codes, therefore, do not assume that worshipping the beast means that a beast will be on a throne and people will be compelled to bow to it. This basically means that everyone will be forced to obey the beast. I pray that you will not be on earth to experience that, in Jesus’ name. <br>There will be some people who will miss the rapture and who will be determined not to worship the beast or take his mark. It will be really tough for them because the antichrist will do everything possible to break them. They will be tortured in every way possible – emotionally, financially, physically, and so on. Worse still, almost everyone in the world will be worshipping the beast, and so they will be loners in a very perverse world. There will be no church meetings and gatherings because almost everyone in the church will have been raptured. There will be no pastor to encourage them and no brother or sister to strengthen them; it will be just them against the world and the government – it will be very tough. Many of the people who determine not to worship the beast will eventually yield and end up in hell. Those who stand their ground will be beheaded by the antichrist. However, when Jesus comes back with his saints to defeat the devil, He will give them another chance to be judged, and they will join Him to reign over the earth for a thousand years. <br>Beloved, surrender your life to Jesus Christ if you haven't and commit to living holy for the rest of your life so that when your time is up here on earth or when Jesus returns, you will be with Him without having to experience the ordeal of the first resurrection.",

Hebrews 9:27 says that it is appointed unto men to die once, so, we are all going to die. Kings, presidents, pastors and General Overseers will all die. As anointed as Elisha was, he still died. <br>Fortunately, Jesus Christ has defeated man's last enemy. In 1 Corinthians 15:41-57, the Bible makes it clear that death has been swallowed up in victory. If you are a bride of Jesus Christ and you are committed to serving God in Spirit and in truth, death is merely a horse that will transport you to your glorious home above. Those who are not born again should be afraid of death because while death leads Christians to heaven, it leads sinners to the second death. <br><strong><em>After a sinner has died on earth, he is judged and sent to hell fire (Psalms 9:17).

Those whose names are not found in the book of life will also be cast into the lake of fire with the devil and his agents (Revelation 20:14-15, Revelation 21:8) – this is the second death. This is the death that you should do everything not to experience. Everyone who dies the second death will be condemned to a lake where fire and brimstone will burn them forever.

      "I was invited by a chief several years ago to pray for him because he was sick. I asked if he was born again, and he said, “Yes”. This made me happy, and I assured him that he will get well. I prayed, but nothing happened. I sent two of my prayer champions to his house to stay there; they fasted and prayed for him for seven days. Still, the man got worse. Then, I decided to fast and pray for 21 days for the man. That was when God spoke, “Son, it is good to fast, but if it is for this man, he will not get well.” I responded, “But this man said he is your son, why don’t you want to heal him?” Then He told me to ask the chief seven questions. The next time I went to visit him, I said, “Chief, God told me to ask you some questions.” He told me to go ahead and ask. Before I finished asking all the questions, he knew that his secrets had been exposed. I thought he would repent so we could pray together for God to heal him, but he told me never to visit him again. Is there anything that you think has been hidden away that you don’t want anyone to find out about? The word of God says in Luke 8:17: <strong><em>For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. </em></strong><br>God knows the secret sins that individuals might have, and if they refuse to confess and repent of them, He can decide to reveal them in such a way that they will be disgraced. <br>The fact that sin is hidden does not mean that its consequences are also hidden. The word of God is clear, whatsoever you sow, you will reap (Galatians 6:7). Proverbs 11:21 says that no sinner will go unpunished. If you are hiding any sins, my advice to you is that you confess them to God and repent of them immediately to avoid their consequences. We have a great promise from God that if we confess our sins and forsake them, He will forgive us (1 John 1:9, Proverbs 28:13). If you have secret sins, you have a choice today to either continue in them and suffer their consequences or confess and forsake them so you can have God’s mercy. Choose wisely.",

      "Today, I will continue my teaching on the importance Tof spending time with children. Many ministers of God make the mistake of putting their ministries before their families – this is not how God wants it. Today's Bible reading tells us that a man must first have his house in order before he takes up leadership in ministry. As far as God is concerned, your home must come first, then your ministry next. If your home is not in order, you have no business being in ministry. <br>If you are a minister, don't neglect your family because you are helping to build other families. There are many ministers' children who have serious issues that need attention while their parents are helping other children settle theirs – this is wrong. Do not ignore your children because you believe that you are already teaching them the word of God during family devotions and church services. Your children don't see you only as a minister, they also need you to listen to them every now and then as their parent. When you are with them, don't talk as a minister, talk as their parent, showing them love and care. The reason many ministers' children become wayward is that they are living with a minister, not their parent. Make the work of ministry something they enjoy and not something they detest because it takes their parents away from them. <br>I realised that I needed to be with my children during festive seasons, and as such, even when we had church programmes at those times, I always ensured that they came along with me. On our way to such programmes, I would share jokes and riddles with them so that they would have fun and be relaxed. Whenever we arrived at the venue of the programmes, wherever I sleep is where they would also sleep. Even when things were quite tough and all I had to sleep on was a wooden bench, we would all sleep on it together. So, rather than see the programmes as things that took their father away from home during holidays, they became times of bonding and adventure for us. <br>When you are praying for great exploits in ministry, remember to pray for your family too. Put them first in the place of prayers. What you pray about shows what you prioritise",

      "Yesterday, I started discussing the importance of spending time with children. As parents spend time with their children, they must also spend time with what and whom their children spend time with. Parents should check the apps on their children's phones to see what they are being exposed to. When they are watching movies or cartoons, they should watch with them to be sure that they are safe for them. They should check the websites they visit and ask them to invite their friends over so they can know the kind of friends they keep. They should visit their schools regularly to know the kind of people their teachers are. Parents should not see anything their children are involved in as too low or immature for them. Whatever or whomever children spend their time with will influence them, and parents must be there to ensure that they are influenced correctly. Solomon, in today's Bible reading, spoke to his son about the people he should interact with. He knew that even after raising him the right way, other people and things could still influence him negatively. <br>There are things parents teach their children that the world will try to convince them to compromise on. Today's memory verse tells us not to be ignorant of the enemy's devices. Parents must pay attention to whatever their children are paying attention to. It will be unwise to teach them and then leave them to the world to corrupt them. Beyond that, parents should occupy their children with godly activities so that they can have things to spend their energy on. They should encourage them to join the workforce in their local assembly as well as Christian book clubs and associations. School activities and excursions are good, but parents must also prioritise spiritual engagements for their children. They shouldn't ignore their children's spiritual growth, but rather, they should teach them to build a connection with the Holy Spirit so that they can hear His voice telling them what and what not to do, even in their absence. <br>If you are a parent, engage your children in conversations to know what they have in their hearts and the things that influence them. Matthew 15:11 says that it is what comes out of a person's mouth that defiles him or her. Talk to them about anything and everything to hear what they will say and know what is in their hearts. <br>I pray that you will not fail God over your children, in Jesus' name.",

      "A major danger in this generation is that parents are so busy with work that they neglect their children. It is absolutely wrong for domestic helps or nannies to spend more time with children than their parents. 1 Corinthians 15:33 says that evil communication corrupts good manners. Whomever children communicate with the most is whom they learn from the most. If you are a parent, you owe it to God to raise the children He has given you and not hand that responsibility over to someone else. <br>Nowadays, it is almost as if couples are competing with each other on who makes the most money. So, while men are out working, women are also working, leaving children without proper care. Fathers and mothers must both be available to raise the children that God has given to them. Psalms 127:3 says that children are God's heritage; in other words, when you leave this world, what God expects you to leave behind for Him are the children that He has brought under your care, and this is not limited to your biological children. Parents are only caretakers, and if they damage what has been placed under their care, they will pay dearly for it. <br>There were times I wanted to play football with my peers as a little boy, but thank God my mother was always home to send me inside the house to study my books. I thought she was being mean, but she built in me the ability to ignore distractions and focus on my goals. The fear of my father's punishments also put me in check while growing up. My elder brother was quite strong, but the day I saw him crying when my father disciplined him, I determined never to do anything that will make my father discipline me. <br>Some children develop bad habits right under their parents' roof. However, the parents only get to find out several years later, and at that time, it takes only the grace of God for them to change. If you are a parent, don't be too busy to train the children that God has given you. When you leave this world, the cars you drove and houses you bought will not matter; what will matter are the children you left behind. There is an African adage that says, 'If you refuse to build your child because you are building a house, the child you did not build will sell the house you built.' As a parent, the children God has given to you must be your priority, not material possessions.",

      "A father has tremendous power over the lives and destinies of his children. Any wise child will always seek his or her father's (biological or spiritual) blessings. This is why you must always think of ways to provoke your father to bless you. Unfortunately, these days, most people are after getting material things from their fathers and hardly think of what they can do to make their fathers bless them. <br>One day, I had just returned from a journey, and two of my spiritual children came to welcome me. The one who got to me first merely greeted me, the other followed suit when he joined us and then proceeded to collect my bags. Immediately he did that, I said to him, “God bless you.” The first son said, “Daddy, you did not say 'God bless you' to me.” I responded, “What did you do for me? You saw me carrying these bags, but you didn't help me.” If you want your father to bless you, you must be ready to do something that will provoke him to do so. <br>One very important thing about a father’s blessing is that it is irreversible. Even though Isaac realised that he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau, he could not reverse it (Genesis 27:33). This is why you must seek your father's blessing in every way you can. <br>Once your father blesses you, you are blessed forever. Nevertheless, blessings are different. Some blessings come from the soul, some from the heart and some from the mouth. When Isaac wanted to bless Esau, he told him to prepare his favourite meal so that after he had eaten it, he could bless him from deep within his soul (Genesis 27:4). <br>A father can bless three of his children, but one will still be greater than the rest because the father loves that one in a special way. How well does your father love you? Do you often provoke him to pray for you or are you the type that provokes him to anger regularly? Some people hardly send money to their old parents, some hardly call them, while some others don't even visit them. They may be old and frail now, but their blessings and curses remain very powerful. Whatever you do, ensure that you get as many blessings as possible from your father before he dies.",

However, being exposed to higher voltages can be fatal. You must be ready to pay the price if you want to operate in higher levels of the anointing. <br>Many years ago, we were at a crusade ground and had been conducting deliverance on one fellow for hours. When the demon wasn't leaving, we had to call my father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, from his prayer room. He came out, commanded the demon to leave in the name of Jesus, and the demon left. I was shocked. I thought I was anointed, but then I saw another level of the anointing. I became determined to grow in the anointing. Some years after that, we were holding a crusade, and while the Bible Study was going on, I went around, making sure everything was going well. At a point, I saw some brethren rolling up their sleeves to cast a demon out of a boy. They saw me and said, “Senior bro is here, let him join us.” I told them that I would pray with them on one condition – that they would allow me to pray first. After they agreed, I closed my eyes and prayed a simple prayer, commanding the demon to leave in Jesus' name. After the prayer, I immediately took my leave, and they were all surprised. Some weeks later, I was passing through the town where we held the crusade and decided to stop by to visit a friend. On getting to his house, I met the boy that was demon-possessed. Before then, he could not go near fire because the demon would push him into the fire. However, to prove to me that he was now free, he cooked me a meal. <br>No matter the level of the anointing you are operating now, there is a higher level that you must aim to attain. It is good that you can pray to raise the dead, but it will be better if you can wave your hands towards a handkerchief and then that handkerchief is used to raise the dead. To attain greater degrees of the anointing, do what Jesus said in our Bible reading for today: fast and pray often. The more you fast and pray, the higher your ranking will be in the Spirit realm and the more anointed you will become.",

And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: </em></strong><br>God told Moses to throw his rod on the holy ground that he was standing on, and the rod became a snake. As Moses bent to pick up the snake, his hands touched the holy ground, and from that day, they became anointed. Every ground is ordinary ground until God touches it. When God touches a ground and your hand touches that ground, that hand can never remain the same. <br>In 2 Kings 2:9-15, when the horses and chariots of fire came to pick Elijah, they swept the ground and took him away. Elijah dropped his mantle, and when Elisha bent down to pick it, his hand touched the same ground that the host of heaven had touched and became anointed. When you study the ministry of Elisha, you will discover that he only used Elijah's mantle once – to cross the Jordan. He didn't use the mantle when he healed the waters in 2 Kings 2:20- 22, neither did he use it when an axehead fell into a river in 2 Kings 6:1-7. The power was in the hand that touched the ground where the holy chariot of God swept. In Acts 26:13, when the light of God shone on the road to Damascus, the Bible says that it was brighter than the noonday sun. That was the light of the Bright and Morning Star. When He came all the way down to earth, Saul of Tarsus didn't just touch the ground, he fell on it. This is why handkerchiefs that had touched his hands and aprons that he had worn worked miracles. <br>Don't joke with any ground that is holy.

The sword of the Spirit is the word of God. In the spirit realm, battles are not fought with physical weapons but with words. The most potent of all the weapons used in spiritual battles is the word of God. The word of God is a powerful sword in the mouth of a believer. With it, you can defeat any force in any realm. Hebrews 4:12 describes this sword as quick, powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword. <br>This weapon is available to you for spiritual battles. When you know how to use this weapon, no force can withstand you. This is why you need to know the word of God for yourself and memorise it. Any Christian that does not study the Bible will be powerless in spiritual matters. When the devil tries to attack your health, counter-attack him with 1 Peter 2:24 that says that you were healed by the stripes of Jesus. When he tries to attack your finances, tell him that the Lord will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19). If he tries to come against your children, tell him that children are the heritage of the Lord so he should get his hands off God's property (Psalms 127:3). <br>The word of God is superior to any other word, so when you present it concerning any case, the devil has no choice but to give in. If you present your own words to the devil in a spiritual battle, he can ignore whatever you have to say. However, he cannot ignore the word of God. Psalms 138:2 says that God exalts His word above His name. Know the word of God and memorise it so that when you are faced with an adverse situation, you will have the weapons to use to conquer the devil. <br>Don't suffer in the hands of the devil when you already have in your possession the sword of the Spirit – a weapon that is guaranteed to defeat him at all times.",

Your head is a part of your body that can be used to identify you, as evidenced by the snapshots used in identification cards. Wearing the helmet of salvation identifies you as a child of God and tells the devil to take his hands off you. <br>It is unfortunate, however, that many believers remove their helmet of salvation when they get to certain circles; they don't want people there to know that they are saved. They try to conform to the world rather than being different. Romans 12:2 says: <strong><em>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. </em></strong><br>When a Christian refuses to identify as a child of God, that Christian is removing the protection from his or her head, and that is one delicate part of the body that will result in instant death if it is struck. Many people lose their salvation because they are trying to conform to the world. Keep your salvation intact by boldly identifying as a child of God everywhere you go. <br>The blood of Jesus, which was shed on the cross, is what gives us the gift of salvation. Those that are saved are of the light and not of the darkness, as seen in today's Bible reading. Hence, you must behave as a child of light at all times. Matthew 7:16 says that you can identify those who are saved by their fruits. If you start exhibiting fruits that are not of God, your helmet of salvation is off, and that spells trouble because on the last day, when Jesus comes back to take His own to be with Him, He will only take those who still have their helmets of salvation on. This is why you must work out your salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12). Don't assume that you still have your helmet of salvation on just because you have been going to church or even because you are a pastor. Check your salvation at all times to be sure that you are still standing. 1 Corinthians 10:12 says that you should take heed if you think you are standing, lest you fall.",

This suggests that there will be times when the devil will try to attack your health, finances, marriage and so on. You should use the shield of faith to ward off all such attacks. A Christian without faith is vulnerable to the devil's attacks. Also, a Christian without faith should not expect to receive anything from God as we see in James 1:6-7. <br>Some things will come up that will try to shake your faith, those are the fiery darts of the enemy. They will look scary and seem to be able to bring you down, but if you hold on to your faith in Christ, you will ward them off. Sometimes, they come as mountains standing in your way. You must command those mountains to be removed by faith, and they will be removed. <br>One interesting thing about the shield of faith is that it can be in different sizes. In Matthew 8:26, the Bible talks of little faith and then we have great faith in Matthew 8:10. The size of your faith will determine how many fiery darts you can ward off. This is why Proverbs 24:10 says: <strong><em>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. </em></strong><br>In order not to faint in the day of adversity, you must build up your faith before adversity comes. Jude 1:20 says that you should build up your faith by praying in the Holy Ghost. Ensure that you pray in the Holy Ghost every day. In fact, pray in the Spirit every minute, after all, that is the only way you can really pray without ceasing as instructed in 1 Thessalonians 5:17. <br>Faith also comes by hearing the word of God as we see in Romans 10:17. If you want your faith to grow, you must ensure that you study your Bible every day. Also, ensure that you listen to sermons from genuine men of God regularly; this will further help your faith grow. <br>One final way through which your faith can grow is through trials as the Bible says in 1 Peter 1:7. Although, many Christians do not want to face challenges, the Bible says that you should count it all joy when you face temptations as they help you become perfect in Christ (James 1:2-4).",

This armour is actually called the 'shoes of the preparation of the gospel of peace'. The first thing to note about this armour is that it implies moving around with the gospel. Your security is in your preaching of the gospel. The more unbelievers you are able to convert to Christianity, the lesser the devil's attacks on you will be. Ecclesiastes 4:12 says that two are better than one, and a threefold cord is not easily broken. When you are the only Christian in your neighbourhood or family, you are more open to attacks because everyone around you is in the opponent's army. However, if you win all your family members and neighbours to Christ, you will be more secure. When the enemy tries to strike, you will have soldiers around you to come together to pray and send the devil packing. When you are feeling weak spiritually, you will have brethren to strengthen your weak hands and lift your feeble knees (Isaiah 35:3-4). <br>The peace element in these shoes will give you peace as you go around preaching the gospel. The devil will come at you with all kinds of things to scare you so that you will not preach the gospel, but when you have peace, his tricks will not work on you. He is like a roaring lion (1 Peter 5:8) that scares people but cannot bite. That peace is necessary as you go out to preach the gospel because you will face persecution. Also, as you preach the gospel, you are to bring peace to chaotic environments. This is why in Luke 10:5, when Jesus sent His disciples out to preach the gospel, He said that the first thing they were to say when they got to a new place is, “Peace be unto this house.” What you are spreading is peace, not chaos, and for anyone that receives the gospel, the first thing they will experience in their heart is peace. <br>Beloved, do you have your shoes of the gospel of peace? Do you win souls? Imagine how much peace will be in your country if one of the souls you have won becomes the president of your country tomorrow.

      "Yesterday, I started a discussion on the full armour of God. Today, I will be discussing the breastplate of righteousness. The breastplate of righteousness is the piece of armour that protects your heart. To be righteous is to always do the right thing according to God's standards. When you are righteous, your heart is protected against the tricks of the devil. The moment you stop being righteous, you expose your heart to all manners of sin in the world, and this is how backsliding starts. The devil is after your heart; this is why Proverbs 4:23 says: <strong><em>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. </em></strong><br>The devil wants to turn your heart away from God, so he suggests sin to you every now and then. However, if your breastplate of righteousness is intact, you will not fall. The devil will present something that does not seem really bad to you. I have always said it, if it is not really bad, it is already bad; stay away from it. If you do that which does not really seem bad, you have opened up your heart to accommodate even more sin. Before you realise it, you will start doing things that you said you would never do again; this is how believers backslide. <br>Is the devil already presenting something that does not seem really bad to you, and you are already making up an excuse for yourself to do it? Desist from that thing immediately; his plan is to get you to remove your breastplate of righteousness so that your heart can become open for his attacks. If a Christian's breastplate is off and the devil attacks his or her heart, it is instant death. Removing every form of carnality from your life is the only way to keep your breastplate of righteousness on. <br>Your thoughts should dwell on spiritual things (Philippians 4:8). If your mind is drawn to carnal things rather than spiritual things, you are in a dangerous state, but when your mind is drawn to spiritual things, the temptations to be unrighteous will become less effective on you. This is why Romans 8:6 says: <br><strong><em>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. </em></strong><br>Beloved, don't let the little things of this world open you up to spiritual death. If something seems bad, stay away because it will only lead to spiritual death.",

      "Over the next few days, I will like to discuss the importance of the full armour of God listed in Ephesians 6:10-17. The first piece of armour listed is the belt of truth because it is the most important. John 17:17 tells us that the word of God is truth. Jesus Christ is the Truth (John 14:6). You are to tie the truth around your waist and have it hold everything else you wear and own together. <br>Those who live by the truth win the battles of life because the truth makes it impossible for them to be captives of anything the world has to offer (John 8:32). <br>The truth will give you a perspective far greater than that of the world (Psalms 119:100). This is why you should live your life according to God's word. When you do this, everyone will see you as wise because you will excel in everything that you do and be above your peers who do not know the truth. <br>The devil is the father of lies (John 8:44); he will try to lie to you and twist the truth every now and then. This is why you must know the truth so you won't fall for his tricks. In Genesis 3:5, he suggested to Eve that she was not yet like God even though Genesis 1:27 says that she was made in His image and likeness. Eve ate the forbidden fruit because she did not really know the truth. In Matthew 4:3, the devil told Jesus to turn stone into bread if He was really the Son of God. Jesus did not fall for that because He was sure that He is the Son of God. If you don't really know the truth, the devil will deceive you, and once he does that, your belt of truth, which holds all your other armour in place, will be gone, making you vulnerable to attacks from the enemy. <br>Don't expect the devil to come with a black cloth and horns on his head; sometimes, he disguises himself like an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). He can tell you that the grace of God covers all sins and that you can keep sinning and still go to heaven. He can come up with logical reasons to tell you that God doesn't exist or that He is wicked and doesn't love you. These are lies that the devil has used to strip people of their belt of truth in the past. Don't fall for his tricks.",

      "Jesus said in Luke 9:23: <br><strong><em>… If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</em></strong><br> If you will truly follow Christ, you must be ready to suffer for His sake. No one follows Christ without taking up his or her cross. An evangelist might have told you to just give your life to Christ and everything will be beautiful. That is true, everything in your life will indeed be more beautiful because you have given your life to Christ. However, there will still be some suffering. Jesus Christ said that when we come to Him, He will take our heavy yokes from us, but He never said that He will leave us without a yoke. Rather, in Matthew 11:29-30, He said: <br><strong><em>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. </em></strong><br>Jesus said that He will give us His own yoke to carry. His yoke is lighter than the one we were carrying before we got born again, but it is still a yoke. <br>The reason many people fall when temptations come is that they were not prepared to suffer for Christ. You must be so determined to follow Christ that you literally say, “If I perish, I perish!” (Esther 4:16). When you do this, your strength will be great, and you will not faint in the day of adversity (Proverbs 24:10). Those that do not faint in the day of adversity always enjoy great benefits when the adversity is over. <br>In Genesis 39, after all that Joseph had gone through in the hands of his brothers, the biggest test of his life came; the wife of his master wanted him to lay with her. He said, “How can I do this thing and sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9). He was willing to face whatever consequence will come with Him following and obeying God. He went to jail, but as soon as God saw that he carried His yoke willingly, He arranged for him to meet Pharaoh, and by the time we get to Genesis 41, he had become the Prime Minister of the greatest nation on earth at that time. <br>Your destiny depends on the answer to this question: are you ready to suffer for Christ?",

      "In today's Bible reading, Elijah came to the widow of Zarephath, who had only one meal left. The Bible Isays in Luke 4:25-26 that there were many widows in the land, but Elijah was only sent to her. This is because God had chosen to bless her with supernatural provision. Even though God had chosen to bless her, she needed to give something to bring the blessing into manifestation. When Elijah asked for her last meal, she could have said, “You want to take the last meal out of the mouth of a widow and her son? And you call yourself a man of God.” However, she obeyed and brought the meal to Elijah, and from that moment on, lack became a thing of the past in her family. <br>God is the owner of heaven and earth; He can get whatever He needs without the help of any human being. He said in Psalms 50:10-12 that if He was hungry, He could eat any of the cattle on a thousand hills because they are His. However, as great as He is, He sometimes requests that a man should give Him something. When He does this, it is because He has chosen to bless that man. God could have provided for Elijah in any way; He had been feeding him for months using birds. In 1 Kings 19:4-8, when Elijah was hungry, an angel brought food and water, so when the brook dried up, God could have sent angels to feed him. It was not Elijah that needed help, it was the widow of Zarephath; she was the one in serious need. When God decides to meet your need, I pray that you will not resist His will. <br>In 2 Kings 4:8-17, you will see the story of the great woman of Shunem. She saw the man of God passing by, and God moved her to invite him to eat. Elisha refused, but the Bible says that she constrained him. Something within her said, “Don't let that man of God go until you have blessed him.” Elisha ate the meal and kept coming back for more. She kept feeding him and even built an apartment for him. Then one day, God put an end to her barrenness when Elisha prayed for her. God prompted her to do the things she did, and although they cost her money, she got what money couldn't buy in return. May you cooperate with God on the day He decides to bless you, in Jesus’ name.",

      "God is Love (1 John 4:8), but He is also a consuming fire (Hebrew 12:29). Many people are on His consuming side, but they think they are on His loving side. Don't be deceived by those who tell you that once you are a child of God, you can behave anyhow. They usually say so because the Bible says that grace came through Jesus (John 1:17). However, the Bible did not say that Jesus is grace, because Jesus is far more than grace. He brought grace, but you will never find anywhere in the Bible that says that Jesus is grace. <br>If Jesus was full of grace alone, John 1:14 would have said 'full of grace' and stopped there, but it went further to add 'truth'. In John 14:6, Jesus said: “I am the way, the truth and life…”. He never said I am grace. <br>When many of my children want to be funny, they will draw a caricature of me wearing a bow tie and holding a tambourine. No matter how funny the drawing looks, when people see the bowtie and tambourine, they will know that the drawing was made in reference to me. I am usually seen with a tambourine, but I am not the tambourine. Let us assume that the tambourine makes me smile at you. If I have the tambourine in my hand as I am relating with you and you do something wrong, I can decide to put down the tambourine, stop smiling, and scold you. <br>In Titus 2:11-12, the Bible says that grace brought salvation to us, teaching us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts. When someone is ungodly and embraces worldly lusts in the name of grace, that fellow has rejected the salvation that came by grace and, as such, will see the consuming side of God. <br>Beloved, I advise you to be wise; enjoy the grace of God, but don't take it for granted. Even though Jesus Christ is full of grace, if a person takes that grace for granted, He will show the fellow His consuming side. Make up your mind never to frustrate God's grace upon your life (Galatians 2:21). God's grace is meant to help you overcome sin; it is not a licence to dwell in sin. <br>Do exploits for the kingdom with the grace that God has made available to you through Jesus Christ.

      "In over 50 years that I have been serving God, I have observed that He always rewards those who give to Him and work for Him. As long as you live a holy life as His child, He will thank you for whatever you do for Him. <br>Some years ago, I was going to Port-Harcourt, a city in Southern Nigeria for a crusade. God told me about a man that I met at the Full Gospel Business Men Fellowship International Conference and said that I should stay in his house. I had only met this man once. I called him and told him what God said, and he shouted and cried in joy. I stayed at his house and grew very fond of his firstborn, who was a very small boy. One day, I was getting ready to go for the crusade when the children arrived from school. I didn't see my little friend, so I asked his father about him, and he told me that he was at the hospital battling for his life. He had ingested some poison while at school. Immediately, I heard God say, “That was why I asked you to stay here.” <br>God had seen in advance that danger was coming to this man's house and that was why He told me to stay there. I later discovered that this man had told all his colleagues in The Full Gospel Business Men Fellowship that he would pay for all their outreaches for one year. With such a sacrifice, it was not surprising that God decided to protect his home from danger. I went to pray for the boy in the hospital on my way to the crusade that evening. When I got there, the Doctor signaled to me that there was no hope, but I prayed, and by the time I returned, I met him at home because he had been discharged. The boy's father had pledged to give to God, and in turn, God rewarded him by saving his son from death. <br>God rewards us bountifully whenever we give Him anything from the depth of our hearts.

Many times, we need to cry to God until He answers us. There are people who will say that you don't need to open your mouth when you pray. While it is true that God knows everything, even before you cry, if you go through the Bible, you will see many instances where people cried to God. In Psalms 120:1, David said:<strong><em> “In my distress I cried unto the Lord and He heard me.” In Psalms 77:1, the psalmist said, “I cried with my voice,” </em></strong>not “with my heart” as many might suggest, saying that you can close your mouth and cry with your heart.<br> David said, <strong><em>“I cried with my voice, and He heard me from His holy hill”</em></strong> (Psalms 3:4). I pray for you; whenever you cry unto God, He will hear you, in Jesus’ name. There is, however, one thing that can prevent God from hearing you, and that is sin. The Bible says that if we regard iniquity in our hearts, God will not hear us (Psalms 66:18). However, if a sinner repents and cries to God for mercy, He will hear. In Psalms 34:17, David said: <strong><em>“The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles”.</em></strong> If you are ready to cry to God today, He will deliver you from all your troubles. <br>I remember when I came to Lagos to work as a lecturer at the University of Lagos way back in 1969, somebody came to me and said, “This is what people do in Lagos – they give money to a prophet so that he will be fasting and praying for them. So, you have to do the same.” I thought to myself, “Ignorant people, the prophet will just take your money and do nothing.” Thank God that we can call on God directly and He will answer us. Isaiah 59:1-2 says:<br><strong><em> Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. </em></strong><br>You don't have to pay anyone to pray for you.

      "Wisdom is the correct application of knowledge Acquiring knowledge and applying it are two different things. For example, if a man is driving on a road and sees a road sign that says, 'Narrow bridge ahead,' as soon as he sees that sign, he has acquired knowledge. However, what that man decides to do with that knowledge will tell if he is wise or foolish. If the man is wise, he will slow down because the bridge ahead is narrow, and there might be an oncoming vehicle. <br>On the other hand, if he is foolish, he will keep driving at the same speed or even increase the speed of the vehicle. God said in Proverbs 4:7 that wisdom is the principal thing. Principal refers to the most important thing. This means that to God, getting wisdom is of utmost importance. The Bible tells us that there are two types of wisdom. The first one comes from fearing God. <br>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: Psalms 111:10 Wisdom begins when the fear of God is established in your life. When you fear God, you won't do anything to annoy Him because you know that He determines your beginning and end. The Bible calls Him a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29); therefore, He is the last person you should offend. Also, if the Consuming Fire is on your side, you have nothing to fear because the word of God says that if God is for you, nobody can be against you (Romans 8:31). Wisdom teaches you to fear God, thus fear Him wherever you go and at all times. The second type of wisdom is the wisdom of this world (1 Corinthians 1:20). This wisdom is not from God and is actually foolishness (1 Corinthians 1:18-25). <br>The world does not recognize God, and as such, worldly wisdom is based on human logic and things that the human mind can grasp. With worldly wisdom, some things can be deemed impossible. However, the Bible tells us that with God, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26).<br> Do not go with the world's wisdom, as it is foolishness before God. Choose to fear God, obey His word, and He will give you wisdom, which is the principal thing that you need to succeed in life. When you embrace godly wisdom, you will be honoured and crowned with God's glory in everything that you do.",

      "Our Bible reading for today tells us that withoutcounsel, purposes are defeated. In other words, if you plan to do something and you don't have any advice, you might not be able to achieve it. Proverbs 20:18 says: Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.<br> Getting advice or counsel, as the Bible calls it, is very needful. Do not begin any endeavour without getting good advice. Proverbs 24:6 says, “…in multitude of counsellors there is safety.” When you surround yourself with many good advisers, you will be safe and unlikely to make costly mistakes in life. Note that it is not every piece of advice that you should take. God said in Proverbs 8:14 that counsel and sound wisdom are His. Every counsel you take must ultimately be from God, and as such, you should ensure that every bit of advice you receive aligns with the word of God before you accept them. This is because some clever people might come to you with pieces of advice that sound very good but that are ungodly and misleading. God is the best counsellor. In fact, that is one of the names of the Lord Jesus Christ according to Isaiah 9:6. <br>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Whenever you get advice from anybody, check for what the word of God says concerning it. If you discover that it is not in agreement with the word of God, then you should know that it is not coming from godly wisdom, and you must reject it. <br>This is why you need to know the word of God yourself so that when somebody gives you a bit of advice, you will be able to differentiate if it aligns with the word of God or not.

      "God has a purpose for everything He does. In Exodus G8:1, He said to Moses, “…Go unto Pharaoh, and 8:1, He said to Moses, “…Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.” God's reason for delivering the Israelites from bondage was so that they could serve and worship Him. Likewise, your salvation comes with a purpose, as the passage in today's Bible reading reveals. <br> In Mark 1:40-45, a leper came to Jesus and said, “I know that You can make me clean if You are willing.” Jesus answered, “I am willing.” With one touch, the leper was cleansed, and he went everywhere testifying. God heals so that there can be testimonies. Also, anytime He sets captives free, it is for a purpose. In Mark 5:2-20, the madman of Gadara was delivered and was ready to follow Jesus everywhere, but Christ said No! He had been delivered for a purpose – to be a witness. God also sets free for His name to be praised.<br> In Mark 3:1-5, the man with the withered hand received his healing because Psalms 47:1 says, “O clap your hands, all ye people…”. A withered hand cannot be used to clap for God, so his hand was restored. What is the purpose of a miracle? The Bible says in Acts 3:1- 11 that when the lame man at the Beautiful Gate received his miracle, he started walking, leaping, and praising God. When you receive a miracle, it is so that you can begin to praise God. Also, miracles lead to the salvation of souls. In Acts 4:4, we see that Peter's speech after healing the lame man led to five thousand people being saved! God does miracles to draw people to Himself. In Luke 5:1-11, when Jesus stepped into Peter's boat after he had laboured all night and caught nothing, he received a huge miracle that frightened him. The Lord said, “From now, you will no longer catch fish but men.” Peter got a breakthrough that drew him to serve God because the Bible says that he forsook all and followed Him. You should ask yourself,<br> “Why has God delivered me from darkness and kept me healthy? Why did He save my soul?” He did all these for a purpose. Have you discovered that purpose? Don't just thank God for healing, salvation, deliverance, and provision; remember that He did everything for a purpose. You must continually seek to discover His purpose for your life and fulfil it.",

You will be surprised at the level of unbelief demonstrated by many who claim to be children of God when they are faced with adverse situations. At such times, fear makes many lose their hold of God's infallible word; this is what happened to the disciples in today's Bible reading.<br> They were so afraid of the great storm threatening their lives even though Jesus was right there in the boat with them. At that moment, they forgot all the great deeds they had seen Him do and all the powerful things they had heard Him teach. Think about yourself, how do you react when you are in trouble like the disciples? Do you blame God, or do you act as if He is not even there with you at all? You must always remember that Jesus Christ is with you in the boat of life. Not only is He with you, but He can also feel the turbulence of the boat and will come to your aid once you call on Him. Hebrews 2:18 says of Him: For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. He personally promised to be with you always, even to the end of the world (Matthew 28:19-20). <br>How comforting! In addition to this promise, He also said to you in Isaiah 43:1-2: Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. I must, however, point out that only the redeemed of the Lord can lay claim to His promises in this Scripture. Have you been transformed by the redeeming work of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary?<br> Do you have the assurance of salvation in your heart? If you are genuinely saved, I congratulate you. Nevertheless, our Lord wants you to demonstrate faith in Him by trusting Him in the midst of adversity. It is impossible to please God without having faith in Him (Hebrews 11:6). I, therefore, encourage you with these words of the Master in Mark 11:22 that says: …Have faith in God.",

      "Peter's encounter with Jesus at the Lake of Gennesaret\xa0is a pointer to the fact that our Lord is indeed a generous rewarder (Luke 5:1-7). <br> He allowed the Lord to use his boat as a pulpit and was rewarded with such a great catch of fish that his boat began to sink; he had to call additional hands to help him manage his breakthrough. <br> There are many areas of service that attract God's generous rewards. One of such is partnering with God to advance the agenda of heaven; this was what happened in Peter's case. Another act that brings heavenly rewards is obedience to the Lord's instructions. You can see this in the story of Abraham, who obeyed God when he was instructed to get out of his father's house to a place God would show him (Genesis 12:1-4). He obeyed, even though he did not know where he was going. As if that wasn't enough, when he was eventually blessed with Isaac, the child of promise, he was asked to sacrifice him as a burnt offering, and again, he obeyed. As a result of his obedience, God rewarded him with an everlasting covenant of blessing and multiplication (Genesis 22:15- 17). <br><br>Another area of service that receives God's attention for generous rewards is hospitality. An example is the story of the Shunammite woman who was so generous to Prophet Elisha that the Lord rewarded her with a son - a gift money could not buy (2 Kings 4:8-17). The story of the widow of Zarephath is another example of how God rewards hospitality (1 Kings 17:9-16). She sacrificed her last meal and that brought about meals that sustained her family throughout a famine. The Bible says in Hebrews 13:2:<br> Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. <br>God also rewards people who host His presence in their homes. According to 2 Samuel 6:11-14, God blessed Obed-Edom so much for housing the ark of the covenant that he became the envy of the king. This is a great lesson to those who are reluctant to submit their homes as house fellowship meeting centres.<br> Such people don't know the blessing they are missing out on by denying God the use of their space. Beloved, as today's memory verse declares, our God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek, serve, obey, and honour Him. Use this to your advantage today.",

      "The joy that comes from knowing God is immeasurable. However, joy is just one of the many benefits enjoyed by those who know Him. From our memory verse, you will understand that those who know their God will be strong and do exploits. As a Christian, you do not have to be fearful about the challenges that come with everyday life. God has empowered you to overcome whatever obstacles you might encounter. The Bible says in Romans 8:37: …<br> we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<br> Furthermore, knowing Jesus empowers you to walk in victory every day and to be bold in the face of trials (Proverbs 28:1). Fear can paralyse a fellow, but God has not given you the spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Knowing God and understanding His perfect love for you enables you to live above fear. The Bible says in 1 John 4:18:<br> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<br> After his encounter with the Lord, Paul was so full of joy from knowing the true God that he penned the words of today's Bible reading, in which he confessed wholeheartedly that Jesus was everything to him. Even after he had attained great heights in the Lord, he still longed to know Him better because he discovered that the more of Jesus he knew, the more joyful, fulfilled, satisfied and hopeful of eternal life he became. I pray that you will experience this type of joy, in Jesus' name.<br> Beloved, knowing Jesus increases your faith in Him, and as you increase in faith, you please God more. The Bible says in Hebrews 11:6 that without faith, it is impossible to please God. The joy of having eternal life is drawn from knowing Jesus. John 17:3 says: And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<br> To know Jesus is to know peace because He is the Prince of peace (Isaiah 9:6). Knowing Jesus is knowing prosperity and abundance (Matthew 14:14-21, 2 Corinthians 8:9). Knowing Him is knowing divine healing and, better still, divine health (1 Peter 2:24). All these and more are the benefits of knowing our Saviour. Beloved, do you truly know Jesus?",

      "In today's memory verse, the Lord reveals Himself as the source of power for prosperity. It is the blessing of the Lord that gives riches without any sorrow (Proverbs 10:22). Those who desire to prosper without sorrow will therefore pay attention to the path of prosperity He has set out in His word. Today's Bible reading also contains truths from God's word that can deliver any soul from the bondage of poverty. Your Father in heaven wants you to prosper greatly, and so, we will examine a few of these truths today.<br> Firstly, the Lord told the children of Israel that the land He was giving them was being taken care of by Him from heaven. In other words, the land would yield its best to them because He was in charge of it, not because of their own efforts. To emphasize this, the Lord described the land to them further, saying in Deuteronomy 11:12: A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. <br>Therefore, to prosper in this world, you need to look away from the present economic situation around you and focus on the economy of heaven that is managed all year round by the Almighty Himself. <br>For the economy of your life to respond to the laws of heaven, you must be subject to the laws of heaven. Many people get excited about God's promises but fail to do their part, therefore, they do not experience the fulfilment of the promises. God gives those who acknowledge Him as their Creator, Redeemer, and Lord the power to prosper. Do you regard God as your Creator? Do you honour Jesus Christ as your Redeemer, or do you take His death for granted by going back to sin even though you have been saved? For God to prosper you, you must honour Him as God indeed. Today, He is asking you the same question He asked the Israelites in Malachi 1:6:A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? <br>If you truly desire the power to prosper from God, you must ensure that your life honours Him. You must also ensure that you fear Him and love Him with all your heart, soul and mind (Matthew 22:37).",

      "Many children of God do not fully comprehend the fact that our God is Omnipresent. When you really understand this truth, your heart will be filled with resounding joy, irrespective of whatever situation you might be going through. In Psalms 46:1, the psalmist revealed Him to us as the Present Help. To reassure us of this, God spoke to us through His prophet in Isaiah 43:2, saying: <br> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .<br> To further convince us beyond any shadow of doubt, God manifested Himself in the flesh and said to us in Matthew 28:20: …lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. <br>How comforting and encouraging this is. No wonder Paul was able to say in Romans 8:31: What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? <br>The reason no one can be against you is that the presence of God is always there to chase any kind of danger and shame away from you. It was the Present Help who saved me from the financial embarrassment of not having enough to feed the crowd that came for one of our conventions. My wife came to me asking for additional money to keep feeding the crowd when the convention was just halfway through. I did not have any money, but the Lord showed up in His usual way of proving Himself mighty in my life. He sent people to me who met this need, and in the end, we had more than enough to feed the crowd. Another time, I was almost stranded during one of my trips to a foreign country because my flight was delayed for one day, and I had spent all the money with me. I prayed to the Present Help, and before I went to bed that night, I had more than enough for the rest of my trip. <br>In today's Bible reading, you are encouraged to be of good courage because God is with you in spite of the enemy's plans to harm you (1 Peter 5:8). <br>Beloved, to enjoy this divine comprehensive insurance, you need to belong to the family of the Present Help.

Some students are focused on the teacher's clothes, some on how he talks, others on impressing other students, and so on. What is worthy of note is that those who focus on less important things lose a whole lot in the end.<br>This same thing plays out in God's kingdom; many Christians do not focus on the right things. All some Christians want from God is a new car, a new house, a promotion and so on. I pity such Christians because they might get what they are focused on but lose out on the more important things they have ignored. <br>Jesus Christ said that you should seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all other things shall be added to you (Matthew 6:33). In other words, if you just focus on making it to heaven by being righteous here on earth, cars, houses and other material things will automatically come your way. I am a living testimony of what Jesus said in this verse of Scripture. I set my focus on the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and now, I can't count how many of these other things I have. The best part is that I am also on my way to heaven.<br> Why focus on things that are temporary instead of things that are eternal? Focus on the eternal things, and the temporary things will follow. Many people never reach the heights that God has ordained for them because somewhere along the line, they take their focus away from heaven and start pursuing material things. Their prayers change from, “Lord, help me to love You more” to “Lord, give me this and that.” You need to remember that when the roll is called up yonder, none of these things will matter anymore.

      "The most difficult instruction Jesus Christ gave to His disciples is probably what we have in today's memory verse. He wants us to love our enemies if we are to be genuine children of God. What are we to do about this seemingly difficult command? Firstly, you should note that His commands are not grievous (1 John 5:3). Also, when you consider the benefits of being a child of God, you will realise that what the Lord commands is just a little price to pay. Amazed by these benefits, John the Apostle wrote in 1 John 3:1: <br> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: <br>The commandment of the Lord to love your enemies is not just a New Testament doctrine. God commands us to do so because He is love Himself (1 John 4:7). He loved us even when we were in His enemy's camp as sinners (Romans 5:8), and since He has commanded us to be perfect even as He is (Matthew 5:48), it means that we have to be like Him in all things (Ephesians 5:1), even in loving our enemies. <br>Why is it so important to God that you love your enemies? One reason is that it practically reflects the true nature of your Father, showing Him to be different from what the devil portrays Him to be (Genesis 3:1-5). When unbelievers experience such uncommon love from you, they are convinced beyond reasonable doubt that your God is good. Many people testify that they gave their lives to Christ because of the benevolent acts of Christians. Your perceived enemies today may be your best Christian brothers and sisters tomorrow if only you will heed the Lord's instruction to love them.<br> Through your love, their wickedness will melt away. One of my relatives, who was an idol worshipper and was well known for his wickedness, decided to follow me to church when he experienced the goodness of the Lord flowing through me into his life. When he was confronted by others as to why he abandoned his deity and foolishly followed me to serve the Lord, he confessed that he was left with no other option but to join me in serving Jesus Christ because of the love I had shown him. He asked those questioning his decision, “Can't you see how my life has been spiritually and materially transformed?” <br>Beloved, be good to your enemies and never repay them with evil.",

Are your hands clean? Are you living holy? The Bible says that if you are not living holy, you are at such a distance from God that He cannot even hear your prayers. Because people who are living in sin are far away from Him, He will not hear them. God hates sin and cannot come close to sin at all. If you want anything from Him, stay away from sin.<br>Some people feel that they can force God to do things for them. Since they do not want to stop their sinful lifestyles and also know that God will not hear their prayers, they will seek an anointed man of God to pray for them. They believe that God will answer the prayers of the anointed man of God. Several times, I have prayed for people for healings, deliverance, and breakthroughs without results. On several occasions, I have cried to God, “What is going on? This fellow is your child, why are you not answering my prayers?” A lot of times, God will say, “You don't know the whole story.” It doesn't matter how anointed a man of God is, God cannot be compelled to listen to his prayers over sinners. <br>My Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, used to say that it is what a father has that he will use to take care of his children.

      "James 1:22-25 tells us that we must not be hearers only, but doers of the word of God. It says that people who are not doers of the word are deceiving themselves and are qualified to be called fools. According to our Bible reading for today, a fool is someone who hears the word and will not act on it. Such a person is like someone who is building a house on sand. Some of the people God called fools according to Psalms 14:1 are those who say that there is no God. <br>If I were to ask many Christians if they believe there is God, they are likely to say 'Sure'. The question is, why then are they careless with His words? Those He calls fools are those who do not take His words seriously. Those who don't obey the word of God do not have the fear of God. Proverbs 1:7 says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. If we all fear the Almighty God, we will not disobey His words. Those who disobey God are fools.<br> For some people, their ideology is, “I obey when I want, the way I want, and only the part of the word that is convenient for me.” Such people have lost the fear of God. In Matthew 21:28-32, Jesus told the story of a father who said to his son, “Go and work on my farm.” The son replied, “I am not going.” He later repented and went. How can your father give you an instruction, and you tell him to his face, “I am not going?” If you were raised the way I was, some lashes will definitely follow such effrontery. As for the second son, the father also gave him an instruction, and he said he will obey, but he did not obey. Proverbs 25:19 says that such a son is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint; someone who lets you down at a critical moment. However, there was a third son that you may not easily notice in that passage; He was the one telling the story. Jesus Christ Himself was the Son who said, “I will go,” and went (Isaiah 6:8). In Matthew 26:39, this same Son said, “…not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<br> Let your disposition to God's word always be, “Not as I will, but as thou wilt.” My prayer is that you will always do the will of God, just like Jesus Christ.",

      "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1:7 The above passage tells us clearly that the Holy Spirit which God gives to us is not a Spirit of fear. This also implies that fear is not a feeling, but a spirit, and that spirit is not from God. As Christians, whenever we find a spirit that is not of God around us, we must banish such a spirit immediately. Today, fear is banished in your life, in Jesus' name.<br> The antidote to fear is faith. Ephesians 6:16 says: “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” When this Scripture was written, soldiers had to go to war with shields as it was essential for their survival against the attacks of the enemy. Likewise, we are to quench the fiery darts of the enemy with the shield of faith. <br>What are these fiery darts? They are the imaginations through which the spirit of fear creeps into a man's life. This is why 2 Corinthians 10:5 says:<br> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; <br>The knowledge of Christ casts down fearful thoughts and imaginations. The more of God you know, and the more aware you are of His power and love for you, the less afraid you will be. You must subject every negative thought to the truth of God's word. When the thoughts come, you should respond with the word of God that counters them. As you do this over and over again, you will overcome those fears. <br>You cannot know God without studying His word, hence, to truly banish fear from your life, you need to study God's word consistently. The Bible says in Romans 10:17: … faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.<br> The more of God's word that you constantly listen to, the more your faith will grow. This will ensure that there is no room for fear in your heart. Study the word of God and meditate on it every day. Memorise His word, especially the portions that speak specifically to the fears you have. As God's word dwells richly in your heart, every form of fear will disappear.",

      "Revelation 22:15 tells us that as far as God is concerned, liars and dogs are in the same category. John 8:44 says that the devil is a liar and the father of lies, so, if you tell a lie, you are declaring openly that your father is the devil. <br> Years ago, I travelled to Ilesha and on my way back to Lagos, I decided to visit my late father in the Lord. I was close to his house when I remembered that he had taught us not to visit men of God empty-handed. So, I stopped to buy some oranges in Surulere. As my father in the Lord was eating the oranges, he said, “Wow, these oranges are sweet, did you buy them on the road?” I understood that the road he was asking about was the road between Ilesha and Lagos, not Surulere, however, I said, “Yes sir”. The moment I said so, the Holy Spirit said, “You lied”. I said, “What is the difference? After all, I bought them at the roadside in Surulere.” Again, the Holy Spirit said, “You lied”. I said, “How does it affect the sweetness of the orange?” <br>The Holy Spirit did not leave me alone, so I said to my Father in the Lord, “Papa, you asked a question just now. I actually bought these oranges in Surulere.” The old man nodded his head and said, “Hmmm, Holy Spirit.” He knew who was dealing with me. This is why it is surprising that many Christians have gotten so used to lying, even in the church. A lying tongue is an abomination to God (Proverbs 12:22). God is irritated by lies, irrespective of where it is told.<br> If God hates lying lips, it means that the prayers of a liar will be unanswered. God does not want to hear the voice of a liar. This is why many are struggling; the lies they love to tell have become a barrier between them and God. Lying can cut a man's life short. In Acts 5, the man and woman who lied to God's representative fell down and died. This is a warning to every child of God who tells lies. God does not want you to be destroyed. Do not tell lies.",

You are not allowed to steal as a child of God. Stealing means taking that which does not belong to you without the permission of the owner or using that which is not yours as if it were. <br>When I was a lecturer, I wrote a personal letter and wanted to use an official envelope. Then, God said, “Don't!”. I replied, “Why not?” He said, “That's for official letters, not personal letters.” I responded, “Lord, how much does an envelope cost?” and He said, “If you know an envelope is that cheap, go and buy yours.” <br>Jeremiah 17:11 tells us: As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool. <br> The scripture above is saying that if a person acquires wealth by fraudulent means, it will not last, and the fellow will eventually regret his or her actions. For example, in 2 Kings 5:20-27, Gehazi fraudulently sought to amass material possessions from Naaman but ended up becoming a leper.<br> Several years ago, I was chairman of a high school's board of governors. I decided to help the school by building a boys' and girls' hostel, a school hall, and the principal's quarters. The principal decided that it was also an opportunity for him to build a small house in his hometown with some of the resources provided for the school's building project. So, as the school buildings were being constructed, he was also building his little mansion. When he finished, somebody surfaced and said, “Who built on my land?” He said, “I bought this land from so and so.” The real landowner replied, “You bought it from the wrong fellow.” The principal said, “Okay, let's not argue, how much do you want for the land?” The man said he was not selling the land and asked him to remove his house. The house is still there today, uninhabited. The landowner didn't bother using the land, he clearly didn't even need it. All the principal's efforts were wasted, and his dreams were dashed because the word of God is clear. <br>The life of a thief is a terrible one.

    bodyText:
      "These days, many people have tried to water down the standards of God because of modernisation. However, the Bible clearly states in 2 Timothy 2:19 that God's foundation stands sure. God said clearly in Malachi 2:16 that He hates divorce. Mark 10:9 also says clearly:<strong><em>What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. </em></strong><br>The moment a man and a woman are joined together in holy matrimony, they are no longer two people but one flesh. Just as you cannot decide to cut yourself into two and continue living, a married couple should never be divorced – God hates divorce. They are joined until death separates them. This is why my late Father in the Lord used to say to brothers who were about to get married in the church, “Once you carry her, you have carried her for life.” Luke 16:18 says that if you divorce to marry someone else, you are committing adultery. The court may give you papers of divorce and a new marriage certificate; however, in heaven, you are recognised as an adulterous fellow. If you are married, know this very well, God does not intend for you to ever get divorced; marriage is a lifetime commitment.<br>Knowing that the moment you are married, you are joined to your spouse for life, you must take extra caution to marry the right person if you are yet to be married. If you have not heard from God with several confirmations, don't get married yet. It is better to be single and make heaven than to be married and have your marriage lead you to hell. Believe me; you will be doing yourself a lot of good if you wait on God to lead you before you get married. <br>If your marriage is troubled, getting a divorce is not the solution. You have already made a vow before God that you will be with your spouse until death separates both of you, and you must uphold that vow (Ecclesiastes 5:5). Rather than considering divorce, go to God, the One who created the institution of marriage and cry to Him for help. Is there anything too hard for Him to do? (Jeremiah 32:27). The answer is ‘No’, for nothing is impossible for Him to do (Luke 1:37), and this includes providing a solution to the problem in any marriage.<br> God hates divorce, and if you are truly His child, you will not want to do anything your Father hates.",

      "In Matthew 6:9-13, the Lord was teaching the disciples to pray. He said in verse 13 that they should cry to the Father, “Lead us not into temptation and in case we have already fallen into trouble, then deliver us from evil.” This part of the Lord's prayer bothered me for a while. Can God really lead someone into temptation? Then I read in Proverbs 22:14: <br>The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein. This means that when someone is abhorred of God, such a person will be pushed into the mouth of a strange woman so that he can be destroyed completely. You will understand this better when you read 1 Corinthians 3:17:<br><em>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. </em><br>So, if you notice that it is becoming very difficult to overcome any temptation, you should go on a retreat for some days and cry to God for mercy. He has promised that He will always make a way of escape for you (1 Corinthians 10:13).<br> Watch your steps. Don't get yourself into a situation where God will say, “I have had enough of you. Go ahead and do as you like, and we will see the result of your actions.” Have you toyed with sin and said to yourself, “There was no repercussion for the things I did in the past, so all is still okay?” Don't deceive yourself; everything you do on earth is recorded in heaven, even your idle words (Matthew 12:36). If you don't stop, one day, God will open that book and say, “Is this person taking me for a fool? I will show him that I am not a fool and cause him to destroy himself.” May that not be your portion, in Jesus' name.<br> Now, I know there might be someone reading this now who is still not willing to stop sinning. This is the kind of fellow described in 1 Timothy 4:2. <br>The truth is, your holiness does not help me in any way; it helps you. I am not asking you to live holy so that I can make it to heaven, I am asking you to live holy so that you will not spend eternity in hell. I have done my duty by bringing this message to you.

      "Many people dwell on their past achievements in the kingdom of God. They talk about the days they were on fire for God, how they used to pray for long hours, and how they used to win souls for God. Currently, however, you cannot see any sign of that same zeal they talk about in them. These are the kind of people we call 'old soldier' where I come from in Nigeria.<br> An old soldier in this context is someone who used to be very active in the army but who, after a while, became old, unfit and irrelevant. Old soldiers, in this sense, are Christians who used to be very vibrant, win souls for God, heal the sick, and perform many wonders in Jesus' name. However, somehow, they started to lose their zeal and became unfit, so that now, when people are talking about zealous Christians, they hardly mention them. Such Christians have moved from hot to cold in the things of God. If this describes you, then you need to retrace your steps and return to your first love.<br>You need to go back to the days when you put God's will above your comfort and convenience; the days when the things of this world were not enticing to you and all you cared about was doing the will of God. You need to go back to those days because being an old soldier in the body of Christ is a very dangerous thing. Jesus Christ said in Luke 9:62 that if anyone places his hand on the plough and looks back, he is not fit for the kingdom of God. To God, past glory is gone; what is more relevant to Him is your current spiritual state. In Ezekiel 18:24, He said that if someone has been righteous all his life but turns around and starts sinning, if that fellow dies in sin, he or she will be condemned. As far as God is concerned, the path of the righteous will shine brighter every day until the perfect day – which is the day he sees Jesus in glory.<br> Like Apostle Paul said in Philippians 3:13, forget those old days of glory and begin to seek God afresh. Make your Bible your best friend more than ever before. Intentionally set out quality time to pray daily. Look for a vibrant fellowship of believers that you can associate with regularly and ensure that your zeal for God's kingdom keeps growing.",

      "One of the ways the devil attacks and hinders God's plan for people's lives is to lead their hearts into a state of hopelessness. It is unfortunate that some people in the church today have yielded to the devil's devices and are living a life that is full of hopelessness. In Ecclesiastes 1:1-14, we see the richest and wisest king in the world speak with a tone of depression and loss of hope. This tells us that money, power, and all the material things of life cannot give anyone joy and hope. Those who allow the deceitful pleasures of sin to erode the love for God from their hearts will one day look at themselves and feel empty. This was what happened in King Solomon's life as we see in 1 Kings 11:3:<br> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. <br>The Bible warns us in Hebrews 3:12 that we should take heed, “…lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.” Solomon departed from God, and his life became empty even though he was a rich king. <br>There is no joy or satisfaction in having material wealth and losing your connection with God. Mark 8:36 says: For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? <br>Money and fame cannot give you hope. Only Christ in you can give you hope for a better tomorrow. With Christ, you not only have high hopes for your future here on earth, but you also have an assured future in eternity. If you have Christ, hold on tight to Him because that is the greatest possession you will ever have. 2 Peter 1:3 says:<br> According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: <br>If you have backslidden at one point or the other, do a self examination, identify where it all went wrong, and go to God in genuine repentance. You should also ensure that you seek help from other believers around you. Never be too proud to speak to someone that can help you regain your connection with God. If your heart has been turned away from God, I pray that He will restore your connection with Him and take away every feeling of hopelessness you might be experiencing, in Jesus' name.",

In Genesis 3:6, Eve ate the forbidden fruit because she felt that it could make her wise. When you are lured to do something to show off, beware! <br>Usually, the enemy catches people who think that they can never be caught (1 Corinthians 10:12). When a fellow says, “I believe in holiness, and I practise it, so the devil can never get me,” he or she should take heed. For example, in Luke 22:31-34, the Lord said to Peter, “Satan desires to have you.” Peter said, “Lord, even if it involves death, the devil will not overpower me.” Jesus replied, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.” <br>In today's Bible reading, we discovered that Samson fell because he was over-confident. Delilah did not hide her intentions, she clearly asked for the secret of his power to know how to overpower him. Samson thought that with his track record, he could not be captured and so, he decided to play a game with the devil. Don't play games with the devil, he has been around for a long while. His track record shows how many great people he has destroyed. 1 Thessalonians 5:22 says, “Abstain from all appearance of evil.” If it looks like evil, don't think that you can withstand it. Run!<br> I know someone who said that he joined one of the secret cults on his campus because he was curious. He said he did it for fun, believing that he would not get involved in the terrible things they do as if that were possible. Don't joke with the devil. The Bible says in Proverbs 16:18 that pride goes before destruction. Proverbs 29:23 says that a man's pride shall bring him low.<br> Some years ago, a lady was to be employed as my private secretary, and I said, “No way!” I know the nature of my work; I work day and night. What will I say I am doing alone in my office at night with another man’s wife. Some people came later and said, “Sir, we thought you were anointed.” I said, “I know, but does the anointing turn your body to stone?” <br>If you think you cannot fall, you are already on your way down because your pride will make you get close to the trap enough for it to eventually catch you.

      "Today, I will discuss the second quality that makes the devil's baits effective. The devil uses baits which are pleasant to the eyes and taste to get people in his trap. For example, Eve considered the forbidden fruit to be pleasant to the eyes and good for food when the devil tempted her with it (Genesis 3:6). Presenting sin as if it is pleasant is an old trick of the devil to trap man, and every believer must be wary of it. <br>If a fellow is controlled by physical senses, he or she becomes vulnerable to the devil's bait. This is why you must be dead to the flesh. When people always want to satisfy their flesh, they will not be able to control their sexual desires, eating habits, and so on.<br> The very dangerous thing about the devil's bait being pleasant to the taste is that if a fellow tastes it once, it can become difficult to stop, just as I described three days ago. The key to avoiding the bait is not to taste it at all. Yes, it looks attractive, but you must not go near it at all. An African proverb says, \"What you should not eat, you should not sniff.”<br> Ask anyone who is addicted to something bad, and they will tell you it all started with a taste. Those who masturbate only tasted it once, and when they saw that nothing happened to them, they did it again and again until they found out that they had become addicted. Those who are addicted to alcohol usually start out as casual drinkers before becoming heavy drinkers. When the trap snaps shut and many of these people look back at their lives, they regret the first day they ever tasted the enemy's bait. If a snare is prepared by the fowler and you stay away from the bait, you will not be caught in it. <br>During the Nigerian civil war, there was a slogan used by one side of the conflict: “The price of safety is unresting vigilance.” Please, my beloved, stay as far away from the devil's bait as you can. If you are addicted to a sinful habit, you need the power of the Most High God to break free from it. Seek help from a spirit-filled man of God and you may also consult a Christian professional counsellor to break free from that addiction. <br>By the grace of God, you will not become the devil's prey, in Jesus’ name.",

The fowler's bait is usually attractive and difficult to ignore. <br>The devil studies a fellow and knows the things that he or she is attracted to. You will hardly see a man commit adultery with a woman he considers ugly. The bait the enemy will use is usually attractive. Don't be fooled by its attractiveness; it has death in it. In Judges 16:4, Samson 'fell in lust' with Delilah and threw all caution to the wind. The devil used his attraction to her to bait him into a trap that eventually destroyed him. There are probably things around you that you are attracted to that are sinful or that may cause you to sin. It is a trap that you should beware of so that you will not become prey to the devil. <br>If a man is attracted to light-skinned women, the devil will put them all around him as temptations to commit fornication or adultery. If he is attracted to flashy cars, the devil will keep bringing flashy cars his way. If he lets his lust for flashy cars push him to steal, then the devil has caught him. This is why Christians must circumcise their hearts to change their affections. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. Colossians 3:2 <br>Do not be too attracted to the things of the world. You must soak yourself in the word of God. Let His word abide in you so much that the only things that are attractive to you are the things that please Him. Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it flows the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23). Beware of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:16). If you discover that things of the world are becoming more attractive to you than the things of God, it means that you are vulnerable to the devil's snare. Declare a fast for yourself, go on a retreat and spend quality time in God's presence till that lust dies.",

      "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? Isaiah 49:24 <br>According to the word of God, anyone who catches prey with a trap like I described yesterday can legally lay claim to it. There are lawful captives of the enemy. We have tried to cast demons out of people before, and they would say, “You are trespassing because this fellow belongs to us. They walked into our trap.” For example, I once had a student who was on his way to his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) station when he fell sick. The doctor said he was allergic to rice. When they brought him to me, and as l was about to pray for him, the Lord said that he had to make restitution. It turned out his father stole a neighbour’s bicycle to pay his school fees, and the owner placed a curse on the thief. His father died from an allergic reaction to rice, and now the son was on the same path. If that had not been revealed to me, we would have prayed in futility because the boy was a lawful captive. <br>l told him to buy a bicycle for the man's son because the man was late. Incidentally, when he returned after doing so, I was about to eat rice. He ate my rice, finished it, and nothing happened to him. Another boy was brought to me for prayers because he was barking. This boy had been having sex with their dog in the house. I prayed, but the barking did not stop. I advised the parents to keep bringing him for the Holy Ghost service every month and be hopeful that God will have mercy and deliver the lawful captive from his captor. When a fellow walks into the trap of the enemy after being lured by his or her lust, the devil can lawfully lay a claim on the fellow.<br> In our Bible reading for today, Apostle James tells us clearly that God does not tempt anyone, but rather, people are tempted by their own lusts, which result in sin and then death eventually. The bait the devil uses does not usually look like death. The bait has three major qualities to make it effective: it is usually attractive to the prey, it is pleasant to the prey’s taste, and it invokes the prey's pride.<br> I will discuss these qualities in detail in the following days because I believe God that after this study, you will never fall into the devil’s trap.",

      "The Bible teaches that there are some people called fowlers who hunt for souls. A very good example of a fowler is an adulteress (Proverbs 6:26). The Bible says that she hunts for precious life. The chief of all fowlers is the devil (1 Peter 5:8).<br> A fowler uses a snare to entrap prey. I grew up on a farm, and we used to get our meat by trapping animals. In the evenings, we would get traps, dig into the soil, put the traps in the hole, cover them with leaves, and sprinkle soil on the leaves so that everything would look normal. After setting the traps, we would put baits (usually corn) on both sides of the traps and then go to bed. At night, when an animal sees the baits around a trap, it will go close and eat some of the corn. When it sees that nothing happens, it moves forward, eats a little more and then goes on until it finishes all the corn on one side. Since it has eaten all the corn on one side, it ignorantly attempts to cross over to eat the corn on the other side, and suddenly, as it steps on the trap, it snaps shut and catches the animal. By morning, it is in our cooking pot. There are countless people in hell today because they tasted sin and nothing seemed to happen, so they kept sinning until they got caught in the devil's trap.<br> Many young ladies from good homes who were taught to keep their virginity have ended up badly because they had sex once, and since nothing happened, they continued until they got pregnant, contracted a disease, or became fully immersed in that terrible lifestyle. One thing a trapped animal experiences when the trap snaps shut is great fear. Likewise, one of the signs that a fellow is in trouble is fear. <br>The one who is caught in the trap of the fowler is called prey. Interestingly, prey sounds like pray. If a Christian does not pray, he or she will become prey. Psalms 91:3 says that the one who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will be delivered from the snare of the fowler. If you don't want to fall into the snare of the fowler, your secret place with your Father must be on fire. If your altar grows cold, you may soon find yourself in the devil's cooking pot. Pray fervently for at least one hour every day, and it will be difficult for you to be the devil's prey.",

      "Light can be shining brightly outside, but if your eyes have grown dim, it will not matter because you will be unable to experience its brightness. Genesis 27:1 says that Isaac waxed old, and his eyes became dim that he could not see. This tells you that when a person's vision dies, it means old age has set in. In Ecclesiastes 12:1-3, when Solomon said, “…those that looked out of the windows be darkened,” that was his way of saying, “When your eyes can no longer see as a result of old age”. So, one of the ways you will know that you are in your old age is when you no longer have visions. Joel 2:28 tells us that you get to an age when visions become replaced with dreams. The right visions drive people to run (Habakkuk 2:2) to ensure that they are fulfilled, while those who dream usually do nothing to bring their dreams to reality. <br>Some years ago, I was talking to three elders who are also my special friends, and I told them that the definition of old age is 'dreamers'. As long as you still have a vision you are pursuing, it means you are not yet old. This is why I sometimes joke that only those who are older than me are elders because I am still pursuing my vision. So, I am still young, even at 82. It is pathetic to see young people who are already old because they have no vision. Yes, they talk about dreams for their future, but they are mere wishes because you don't see them pursuing them at all. When I see such young people, I often think to myself, “Young fellow, where is your vision?” <br>When a person becomes a dreamer instead of a visioner, then the fellow is old. Such a person's day, which is the time he or she has to spend on the earth, is almost over. The word of God says in Proverbs 29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.” In other words, when a person's vision is gone, the fellow is on his or her way out. I believe God is talking to a specific reader of this devotional. You had great visions, but now, you have forgotten about them. Wake up!",

      "To some, eternity seems like a far-off idea that should not be given much thought. However, it is a reality you must not lose sight of. The truth is, everyone will have to ask themselves, where will I spend eternity? God has provided answers to this question in the Bible and has made them plain and accessible because He does not want eternity and the events surrounding it to take anyone unawares. It is therefore surprising that some Christians live in this world without eternity on their minds. Such Christians can be easily spotted from their lifestyles and attitudes toward the things of God. They live as if they will be on earth forever, whereas Hebrews 13:14 says:<em>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</em> <br>This was not the lifestyle of the heroes of faith. From the things they set their affections on and their confessions, people could tell that they were eternity-minded. Hebrews 11:13-14 tells us that they saw themselves as strangers and pilgrims on earth. Hebrews 11:16 says: <br><em> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. </em><br>What a glorious testimony this is. I desire this for myself, and I pray that you will also have such a testimony, in Jesus' name. <br>Don't let the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches blur your vision of the place Christ has prepared for you. Eternity is real, and where a person spends eternity is determined by the way he or she lives in this present world (Romans 2:3-10). The place Christ has prepared for you is a place where you will no longer die, it is a place of joy and pleasant experiences (Revelation 21:1-7). On the other hand, there is another place where whoever rejects God's grace in Christ will spend eternity. This place was prepared to punish the devil and his demons, but those who live their lives to please the world, their flesh, or the devil will also partake in it (Matthew 25:41). It is a place of everlasting fire and pain. May you not be found there, in Jesus' name. To escape this horrible and eternal torment, give your life to Christ today, and if you have done so, live holy and remain eternity-minded.",

      "Many people who claim to trust God with all their hearts surprisingly depend on their own understanding and attempt to strategise their way through life. The question, however, is, how deep is our understanding? Do we understand as much as God does? You must understand that two captains cannot be in charge of a ship at the same time. It is either you let God take the wheels of your life, or you leave Him out of it. You cannot be in the driver's seat and only remember God anytime you run into trouble; you must trust Him totally and rely on Him for everything. If you are truly a child of God, you must always be led by Him (Romans 8:14).<br> Trusting God does not start out easy; He will work on you, and as He leads you, He will mould and shape you to become a better person. When you trust God to lead you, everything you touch prospers. Abraham was a man who trusted God completely, and he prospered greatly. He left everything he ever knew for a land that God said He would show him. He left without a plan; he was determined to trust God all the way. Shortly after, he grew so big that he had 318 men who could go to war with him living under his roof (Genesis 14:14). He was so rich that he rejected a king's gift so that the king would not take glory for his prosperity. <br>When you trust someone, you don't ask unnecessary questions. When you board a plane, you trust that the pilot knows what he is doing and that he will take you safely to your destination; you don't ask to see his license or inspect the condition of the plane. If you can trust human beings with your life that much, how much more the Most High God?<br> I learnt to trust God very early in my Christian walk because my Sunday School teacher taught me that if a son is at the top of a high place and his father asks him to jump, he will not ask questions because he knows that his father will catch him. The moment I learnt that, I began to trust God so much that once He says “Jump,” I jump, knowing that He will catch me.

Many years ago, I invited some ministers to teach at The Redeemed Christian Bible College.

By the time I got back to the class, the students had believed the people I invited. I needed to convince them otherwise, so I went to get two oranges. One orange was yellow, and the other was green. I raised both oranges up in the class and asked, “Which of these two oranges is ripe?” They all pointed at the yellow one. I asked again, “How did you know?” They said it was obvious from the outside that it was ripe on the inside.

I pray for you today, God will show up for you and give you that long-awaited miracle, in Jesus' name.<br>I remember when I became the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I did everything I knew in line with the word of God to make the church grow.

When I get to the church the following Sunday, at times, the congregation will even look smaller than what we had before the programmes. One day, some weeks before my birthday in 1986, God ended my barrenness.

I think you should really give Him thanks.<br>When people see me dancing in agbada at least once a year to praise God in my mother tongue, many of them do not understand. The day I asked God how He could choose the product of a sinful relationship like Solomon to be king, He also asked me, “Is your mother the first wife of your father?” I had no more questions because, based on the circumstances surrounding my birth, I don't deserve to be called to pastor His sheep. I am always grateful to God because to whom much is given, much is required (Luke 12:48). Even the fact that I am here in this world is something to be grateful for. My mom had made up her mind that she wasn't having any more children because she already had as many girls as she wanted and a boy. However, the boy died, and people begged her to give birth again. She agreed, and I was born. Coming from that background, and also considering all the sins I had committed before giving my life to Christ, it is a privilege that God could save a soul like mine and make me a pastor. So, I know why I dance and sing praises to my God.<br>When we say, “Let us thank God,” those who feel that they deserve everything they have don't see the importance.

      "Today, I will conclude the teachings I began two days ago on how to pray effectively. Many people make the mistake of giving up on their prayers when it appears as if God is not responding. Such people are only cheating themselves when they do that. To really get the desired results from prayers, you have to be persistent. Isaiah 62:7 says:<br><strong><em>And give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. </em></strong><br>You are to give God no rest until He has answered your prayers. Jesus Christ said in John 16:24 that you should ask, then you will receive so that your joy may be full.<br>From our Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ assures you that if you keep knocking on God's door, asking Him for something, He will give it to you. According to Him, even the wicked judge gave the widow what she wanted, how much more the good shepherd. This tells you right away that if you keep praying about that issue, no matter how long it takes, God will answer you. There are prayer points I prayed for 15 years before I got answers. I did not stop after praying for a few weeks. I kept knocking on heaven's doors, telling God, “I will not let you rest until you have answered me,” and He answered me eventually.<br>This is an attitude that you must also imbibe. Some people get angry that God has not answered their prayers after a while and so, they stop praying. God is not your servant that you can command as you please; He is the King of kings. If you want something from a king, you must learn to humble yourself and keep asking until He is ready to give it to you. If you ask for a little while and go away without receiving anything, who would have lost?<br>You or him? You may say, “What if God is not willing to answer my prayer at all?” You have to keep asking Him until He answers you. This is why you must pay attention to hear what He will say when you pray to Him. Don't just keep asking, seek to hear from Him. The Holy Spirit is always available to teach you what prayer points to pray, and if He is the One teaching you how to pray, you can be sure that you are praying right.",

      "Yesterday, I discussed the importance of being totally focused while praying. Today, I will continue the discussion on how to pray effectively.<br>When you pray, you must note that prayer is not a one-way conversation but a dialogue between you and God. In other words, prayer is not complete when you only talk to God and do not give Him the opportunity to speak back to you. In fact, whenever I pray, and I don't get a response from God, I become worried because I really want to hear what He has to say. Even if his response is a rebuke, at least I know He has heard me. Habakkuk 2:1 says:<br><strong><em>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</em></strong> <br>You are to stand on your watch until you hear what God has to say. It is not just a time to pour out all your complaints, wait to hear from Him too.<br>The reason many people don't hear from God is that they just come to the place of prayer and start making requests. Isaiah 55:6 says that you should call on Him when He is near. You must first draw Him near to you before you call on Him. Psalms 100:4 says:<br><strong><em>Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.</em></strong> <br>The Scripture above means that if you want to go near God, as you enter into His courts, you should come with praises and thanksgiving.<br>In our Bible reading for today, Jesus taught the disciples how to pray. He started with praise, saying, <strong><em>“Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.”</em></strong> It is this praise that gets you into His courts and then gives you an audience with Him. Before you pray, praise God first. For a prayer session of one hour, spend at least 50 minutes praising Him. After you have praised Him sufficiently and He has drawn near to you, you can be sure that He can hear you and that you will receive answers to your prayers.",

      "Prayer is a very powerful tool given to us by God for regular communication with Him. As powerful as this tool is, it is rather unfortunate that many people don't use it at all while some who do, fail to make the best of it. <br>The first thing that must be in place for you to pray effectively is focus; all distractions must be done away with. The devil knows that you need to be completely focused to get the best out of your prayer time, and this is why you usually remember some not-too-important things that can distract you during prayers. One of the reasons you see many men of God praying when everyone is asleep is that they don't want to be distracted. In Mark 1:35, Jesus Christ woke up before daybreak to pray while others were asleep. He went to a secluded place to pray. You must try to remove distractions. Find a secluded place where you can always go to pray. That secluded place could be your closet or any other place without distractions.<br>Anyone who does not regularly go to a secluded place to pray will eventually grow cold spiritually; I am saying this from experience. Many years ago, God pointed my attention to the fact that I was growing cold. He asked me, “When last did you spend quality time in my presence? Do you remember when you used to worship me in your car so much that my presence will fill the car, and you will have to park by the roadside because tears would have filled your eyes?” I responded, “Yes Lord, I remember, but that was before I had a driver. If I worship you that much now and my driver sees tears in my eyes, he will think something is wrong.” He responded, “Oh, it is now my fault that I gave you a driver?” I quickly apologised. That night, I left the house when everyone had slept to pray in the auditorium. The moment I started worshipping, the tears came rolling down. I had been praying all the while, but the major difference was that I had not been going to a secluded place to pray, and that had made me grow cold. Now, I have made it a habit to pray in secluded places, and my fire has increased greatly as a result.",

If you want them to behave rightly, let them see you do what you are asking them to do consistently first.<br>When you lie to get a favour for your child in school, and then turn around to tell that child not to lie to you, you are deceiving yourself. If they hardly see you pray and read your Bible, you can't turn around and ask them to read their Bibles.

What they don't know is that when they start looking and talking like them, they are endorsing their lifestyle and some of their negative actions. They can't change them that way, rather, they will only reinforce their negative behaviour. Instead, they should be a standard for the youths to follow. More often than not, the youths know the truth and when they do the wrong things, they actually expect the elders to correct them. Now, imagine their confusion when they see their elders doing the same things they want to be corrected about. In Yorubaland, where I come from, we call elderly people who behave childishly 'agbaya', meaning 'shameless old fellow'.<br>God is counting on elders to guide the younger ones on how to behave for them to have a better tomorrow. God also expects the youths to submit to their elders in humility. Finally, Titus 2:2 says that elders should be sober, brave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity and in patience.

There are other things to spend money on,” and I listened to them. However, one night, God said to me, “Son, who called you? These people or Myself? Who promised you a city instead of a boy's quarters?”. I woke up and made up my mind to keep buying more land, but by then, what used to be N1,000 had gone up to N50,000.

What should a fellow do if he or she has missed his or her flood? If a person has not made good use of his or her flood period, is there any way out before the night falls? If God is keenly interested in such a fellow, He will assist him or her to do one or two things that will turn the situation around.<br>Esau missed his flood when he sold his birthright. When the time came to get the generational blessing, he missed that one too. Genesis 27:34 says that He wept bitterly. Esau repented and cried to his father, saying, “Can't I get just a leftover blessing?” God saw that his repentance was genuine and that his request for just a little bit of blessing was a passionate cry. As God is rich in mercy, He gave him the grace to recover some of the lost grounds. After Esau left his father, he made up his mind to make the best of the little blessing he got from him and prove everybody wrong. By the time we get to Genesis 32:3-7, Jacob sent some animals as gifts through some servants to tell Esau that he was coming home. Those people returned to tell Jacob that Esau was coming with 400 bodyguards to meet him, and the Bible recorded that Jacob trembled with fear. The one who got the original blessing trembled when the one who got the leftover approached him. By the time we get to Genesis 33:1-9, when they finally met, Esau asked Jacob why he sent all those animals and told him that he already had enough. Esau was so blessed that he asked Jacob to keep his possessions. He was indirectly saying, “I might have missed my flood, but as long as I am still breathing, I can still work my way to the top.”<br>You might have also missed your flood, but as long as you are still breathing, it is not too late. You can work your way to the top if you are determined to do so with God's help.<br>Don't give up on yourself. There are people who became successful in their old age. They may be few, but you can be one of the few. What you need is an undying determination and the grace of God.",

Job 12:12 says that wisdom is supposed to be with the ancient; years are supposed to teach wisdom. Job 32:7 says that days should speak, and multitudes of years should teach wisdom.

What lesson can we learn from that? When David was at his peak, he had prepared for the time he would grow faint.

Those that spend their youthful days engaging in all sorts of vices will reap plenty of trouble later in life (Galatians 6:7).

In Psalms 55:17, David said, <strong><em>“Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.” </em></strong>Day is God's unit of measuring the time of man on earth. Psalms 90:12 says, <strong><em>“Teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.”</em></strong> Proverbs 10:27 tells us that although God can lengthen a fellow's days, He can also shorten them.<br>According to the memory verse for today, the morning is the time for growing up, and it is the time for joy (Psalms 30:5). When you are growing up as a child, you have no responsibilities. When children wake up in the morning, they want breakfast to be on the table, and how it gets there is none of their business.

The evening is when things begin to become dim, and the sun is about to set. 1 Samuel 4:15 says that Eli was 98 years old and his eyes waxed dim.

It also means that every darkness around you will be consumed, and you will be basking in His light.<br>When God decides to show you favour, you will achieve more than somebody who is working extremely hard without divine favour. When God shows you favour, miracles happen. For example, Genesis 24:63 says that Isaac went for a stroll and in the 67th verse of the same chapter, the Bible says:<br><strong><em> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</em></strong><br>All the background work in getting Isaac a wife was done by some other people.

I decree that from now on, God will show you favour.<br>Not too long ago, all the universities in Nigeria were ranked, and Redeemer's University came second.

During the first service I attended at RCCG, we were asked to shout hallelujah, and the fellow beside me shouted so loudly that I almost ran out of the church. Where there is power, there must be noise. The Concorde, a plane that could take you from London to New York in about three hours, was grounded partly because people said it was noisy. With its powerful engine, it was bound to be noisy.<br>These days, many Christians have to be cajoled to shout 'hallelujah'. I remember many years ago when I was asked to preach during a Christmas carol at Aso Rock, and all the high and mighty were there. When I asked them to shout hallelujah, they shouted like sophisticated ladies and gentlemen, until I said, “The next fellow to shout hallelujah is the only one who will see the new year.” This time around, they really shouted. Real Christians do not have to be threatened to praise their Father.<br>Many years ago, I was walking and praying within Redemption City in the middle of the night, hungry and thirsty for the power of God. I had been crying, “Lord, I told You from the beginning that I don't want to be ordinary. I was serving You as much as I could when I was still lecturing at the university, making some money to do Your work, but you pulled me out. Now, You have made me a General Overseer, and I lack the power to do the work that must be done. Father, either empower me or take me home.” As I prayed, the ground under my feet shook violently. There was an earthquake that was felt from as far as Ijebu-Ode – it was in the newspapers. An earthquake is not quiet. Noise is necessary for power; stop trying not to be noisy. Don't hinder the move of God with your so-called sophistication.<br>I am at a point in my life where I need other people to carry more fire than me so that when I am leaving, I will know that I am leaving commandoes behind that will take the work of God farther than I did. Stop forming, as the youths will say, when you are in the presence of God. Be free to make a loud noise that will shut the devil out and let the power of God flow.",

      "There are many Christians who say that they do not take nonsense from anybody. However, these same people take nonsense from the devil. Whether you take nonsense from people or not is not very important, what is most important is that you do not take nonsense from the devil. The Bible says: <strong><em>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: </em></strong>1 Peter 5:8 <br>Will you sit around and let him come and devour you? You should stand your ground against him and set his tail on fire so that he can run far away from you.<br>One of my daughters shared a testimony some time ago. Her child was sick, and they took the child to the hospital. On getting there, the doctor said that there was nothing he could do to save the child. The woman asked, “In that case, can you refer us to another hospital?” The doctor referred them, and on their way, they got stuck in a terrible traffic jam. While in the traffic jam, the child died. The woman said, “I am not going to take this,” and after five hours on the road, she suddenly had a brainwave. She said, “At least my father will call his God, and his God will answer. I will call on the God of my father, and I even have a handkerchief that he once prayed over.” She laid the handkerchief on the child, called the child's name and commanded him to come back to life. The child jerked awake, and there was no need to go to the hospital anymore.<br>When you are determined not to let something evil happen, your prayers will be more fervent than usual. There are probably things in your life that the devil has been using to torment you. These things will only stop when you become determined not to take any nonsense from him again. If you have been praying gentle prayers concerning these things, it is time to use your authority in Christ and start issuing commands in your prayers.<br>You must however, submit yourself to God first before you can successfully stand up to the devil. James 4:7 says:<br><strong><em>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</em></strong><br>If you are sure of your right standing with God, when you resist the devil, he will run away from you. Stop taking nonsense from him!",

      "God loves unity; wherever He finds people uniting in His name, He will show up. You can see a good example of this in 2 Chronicles 5:13:<br><strong><em> It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD; </em></strong><br>In the above passage, as the trumpeters, singers and musicians all sang as one, God's presence came down like a cloud and filled the temple. God loves it when His children worship Him in one accord. This is why Jesus Christ said in Matthew 18:20, “Where two or three people are gathered in my name, there will I be.” At the upper room in Acts 2, the Bible says that when the people were in one accord, the Holy Spirit filled the room with a sound like a mighty rushing wind. Wherever believers are gathered in unity, God will show up in His glory. <br>Today's Bible reading tells us that when brethren come together in unity, it is like the anointing oil that was poured on Aaron's head which went all the way down to his feet. Do you know what that means? It means that it is only when God's people are united that the anointing can flow amongst them. Without unity, the corporate anointing will not flow. The reason many churches are not experiencing the power of God amongst them is that they are not united. Where there is gossip, strife and backbiting, don't expect the power of God to flow. These vices are not of God, and so, God cannot be where they exist. <br>1 Corinthians 12:12 says that we are all different parts of one body. If the hand is envious of the eyes and the leg is keeping malice with the head, how can the body function effectively? When we become united in our local assembly and in the body of Christ as a whole, we will see great miracles amongst us that will amaze the whole world. If you are a pastor reading this now, you should ensure that all forms of strife amongst workers and/or members of your local assembly are resolved today.",

This was why I laughed when I heard someone say to me some time ago, “I've been serving you all these years.” I was amazed, so I responded, “Serving me?!” I thought we were serving God together on the same platform. You need to really know whom you are serving. Are you serving God, your pastor, or your Head of Department in church? If you are serving God, you won't only behave well when your pastor or Head of Department is around, but you will do so at all times because the One you claim to be serving can see you all the time. <br>For some people, they are serving their Neighbours. They want their Neighbours to see them as fervent Christians, but, in secret, they keep committing sins. If you really know you are serving God, you will care more about being holy in His eyes than looking holy in public. Revelations 4:11 says, “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” You are to please God irrespective of the people around you. <br>Lastly, some people claim to be serving God, but they are actually serving their needs; they come to Him only because they need something from Him. Everything they do for God is motivated by what they want to get from Him. For example, this is why there are people who reduce their commitment in church or even stop going altogether once they get the job that they have been praying about. For some, they are only in church because they are looking for a godly husband or wife to marry. In John 6:24-26, Jesus sent the people who were coming to Him because of bread and fish away. Such people's service is not acceptable to Him; He can see their real intentions and does not count them among His children. <br>Are you serving God, people or your needs?

Titles are beautiful, but I will rather be a deacon that can raise the dead than be a National Pastor that cannot heal a fly. <br>I preached a message on total surrender one day in church. In those days, only a few members had cars. After the service, a young man came to me and said, “Daddy, from now on, I surrender all to Jesus.” I said, “Really?” He said, “Yes”. I then said, “Good. So, we will now be able to borrow your car tomorrow for a church assignment.” He replied, “But I have to go to work tomorrow”. I laughed and said, “I just wanted to show you that you haven't surrendered all.” I only asked about the church borrowing his car, and that was difficult for him to agree to. What if I had asked for something bigger?<br> What could make an individual surrender totally to God and even serve Him without pay? I found the reason in Philippians 2:5-11 which is our Bible reading for today. It started by saying, <strong><em>“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:”</em></strong> It further told us how great Jesus was and how He humbled Himself unto the point of death, even the death on the cross. Then verse 9 says, <strong><em>“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him…” </em></strong>At that point, I knew that the gain always outweighs the pain. Hebrews 12:2 says:<br> <strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</strong><br> When you seek the things of God first, the other desires of your heart will also be granted unto you according to His will. When you lay your life down for God, He will surely honour you in return. There is great joy awaiting anyone who surrenders totally to God. If you surrender all that you have to Him, He will give you more in return. Beloved, surrender all to God and He will bless you far beyond your imagination.",

      "In continuation of my discussion yesterday, one of the challenges of being anointed is that anointed people are perceived to be stronger than they really are. Because they pray and God answers immediately, people think that they don't need prayers themselves. Also, because they lay hands on the sick and the sick get healed, people think that they are superhuman and can never be weak or tired. Because they preach and souls get saved, there is a tendency to think that they never get tempted, whereas they probably face temptations more than other people. <br>Moses made just one mistake in 40 years of leading the Israelites, but God said he would not get to the promised land. He had been interceding for Israel whenever they did terrible things, and God had been forgiving them. Now, in his own case, there was nobody to plead for him. <br>Do you want to be heavily anointed? Be ready to work endlessly. When I discovered that the Bible says that we should earnestly covet spiritual gifts, I was happy. I asked for double the anointing on Elisha, Peter, Paul and Jesus Christ when He was on the earth and then asked that all should be combined and doubled again. God warned me then that I was asking for a dangerous thing because people would not let me rest. When people see that you are anointed, they will bring all their problems to you. Even after you minister to them from the altar, they will still want to see you personally. You cannot send them away because the purpose of the anointing is to serve. <br>When I employed a personal assistant, and he asked, “What are our work hours?” I said, “We start the day at 5am and only God knows when we will close.” This is why raising other people who will also become anointed is necessary. RCCG is in over 190 nations in the world. How will I cope if every member comes to me with their problems? This is why each local assembly has anointed pastors that can pray for the members; only the cases they can't handle come to me. God has also made things easier by making it possible for me to pray from the altar and anoint handkerchiefs which are used to perform the miracles that people would have called the General Overseer to pray about in the past. <br><br>A lot of responsibilities and challenges come with being anointed, so if you desire to be anointed, you should be ready to embrace them.",

Psalms 23:5 says, <strong><em>“Thou anointed my head with oil, my cup runneth over.” </em></strong>He has more than enough for everybody, but are you willing to pay the price? Are you willing to go through the challenges that come with being anointed? Hebrews 1:9 says that if you love righteousness and hate iniquity, God will anoint you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.<br> Yesterday, I mentioned some benefits of being anointed, but it is also important to note that the anointing also comes with some challenges. The major challenge with being anointed is that power can corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The more anointed you are, the more careful you must be because of the tendency to misuse the power. In Numbers 20:1-13, especially verse 10, Moses said to the people, “Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?”<br> Only a few minutes before then, he was on his face before God, asking for a solution to the problem. The moment God told him what to do, he turned to the people who had been provoking him, called them rebels, and spoke as if the power to bring water out of the rock was from him and not from God. In verse 12, God said that because he did not sanctify Him in the eyes of the people, he will not enter the promised land.<br> I have always told pastors in The Redeemed Christian Church of God that no one must ever feel as if he healed anybody. Left alone, you cannot even heal a rat! It is God who heals, and you are only a vessel through which the healing takes place. You must always see that as a privilege. Since the power to perform miracles is not yours, God can use anyone else to do it. A man of God once said that if you remove God from him, there will be little left. I was surprised because, in my own case, if you remove God from me, there will be absolutely nothing left. <br>Beloved, never forget that without God, you are nothing. Anyone who thinks that he or she can be something without God is clearly on a path to destruction. No matter how anointed you are, never allow yourself to think that you are all-powerful.

Also, you can become a blessing, even to the rich and powerful. You can sit in your room and tell a rich fellow, “Go and wash,” as Elisha told Naaman, and if the fellow obeys, he will be healed. It is important to note, however, that if an anointed person blesses others solely for monetary gains, the problem of the rich will become the fellow's problem as Naaman's leprosy came upon Gehazi (2 Kings 5:20-27).<br> The anointing gives you the power to put smiles on the faces of people who would otherwise have been sorrowful. When I turned 80, I insisted that I wasn't throwing a party. However, some General Overseers gathered in my office after the Holy Ghost Service that day. When they were asked to share testimonies, one of them, a medical doctor who is now a General Overseer, said two of his daughters became terribly sick. One was already gasping for breath when all of a sudden, he thought, “I have prayed, and nothing has happened, at least I know someone whose anointing is more than mine,” so he called me that night. When he told me what was happening, God asked me to tell him to do some things. When he started doing what I asked him to do, the other doctors that were with him started wondering what he was doing. He told them this wasn't medicine, but an instruction that came from Redemption Camp. The children survived miraculously, and today, one of them is a doctor, and I think the other is an engineer. If you want to be able to turn sorrow away from families, pursue God's anointing. <br>The anointing also gives you divine security. Our God is like a coin that has two sides, He is Love (1 John 4:8), and He is also a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29). When He says touch not my anointed, He is saying, “Don't touch fire.” In Africa, we have a saying that even when a dog is mad, it still recognises fire.

Now, the question someone may have in mind is, “What do we do with ministers of God who we believe to be erring?” This is a very delicate situation that requires God's wisdom and direction. For example, in our Bible reading today, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of something they believed he did wrong. At the end of the day, Miriam became leprous, and Moses had to pray to God for her to be healed. <br>It is not in your place to judge God's servants; leave their judgments to their Master. In Romans 12:19, the Bible says clearly that vengeance is His, just report the matter to God, and He will deal with His anointed as He pleases.<br> Anointed ministers of God cannot hide under the canopy of being God's anointed and begin to treat His sheep the way they like. Hebrews 10:31 says that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; believe me, a fellow should not experience God dealing with him or her Himself. The reason we discipline erring workers is to shield them from God doing it Himself. When a pastor misbehaves, and the General Overseer suspends him, it is so that the Consuming Fire Himself will not be the one to do it. So, if a pastor overlooks a fellow's wrongdoings because of his or her contributions to the church treasury, that pastor is doing more harm than good because God Himself will come in, and nobody wants to fall into the hands of the living God.<br> In 2 Samuel 11, David used his position to snatch another man's wife and also got him killed. Nobody could punish him as there was no one who was superior to the king. God had to step in to punish him. From that point on, there was no peace in David's home. Not long after, one of his sons, Amnon, raped his half-sister, and then another son, Absalom, killed him. Later, Absalom rose up against his father.

However, many anointed people believe that the caution to be careful with the anointing does not apply to them. This is not true. The fact that you are anointed does not give you permission to cause another anointed man of God harm. This is one of the major killers of some ministers of God; they speak evil of their colleagues, and when the repercussions come, they go to God complaining and wondering why things are not going well with them.<br> In 1 Samuel 24:1-6, a rare opportunity presented itself for David to kill King Saul, who had been seeking ways to kill him. David's followers were happy about the opportunity, but David refused to kill him. However, so that Saul would know that he came close enough to kill him, he cut off a small part of his clothes. The Bible says his heart smote him, meaning that he was uncomfortable with what he did. Even though God had forsaken Saul, David still acknowledged that he could not lift his hand against him because he was anointed. <br>I remember when I was ordained a pastor and got anointed, for three days after they poured the oil on my head, I didn't take my bath because I treasure the anointing. It took me a while to realise that no amount of soap can wash away the anointing. Once a person has been anointed, the fellow remains anointed even when he or she backslides. Even in that backslidden state, you must be careful of how you treat the person because of the anointing. I have never said anything negative about pastors who have left The Redeemed Christian Church of God dishonourably. The reason is that the oil is still on their head, and I don't want any trouble with God. <br>The only exception is when God Himself authorizes the action. For example, God may use the vessel that He used to anoint a man of God to deal with the same man of God. In this case, the vessel is acting as a representative of God. In 1 Samuel 15:27-29, Samuel refused to worship with Saul, and because Saul didn't want to be embarrassed in front of his cabinet, he pulled Samuel back and tore his clothes. Samuel turned around and said, “Your kingdom is torn from you.” He made it clear that the reason he was making that decree was that the Lord who sent him to anoint Saul was pronouncing judgement on him.",

Roast!” Immediately, fire came down from heaven and burnt the captain and his soldiers. When the king waited, and those 51 soldiers didn't come back, he sent another 50 soldiers with their captain. When the captain got there, he saw ashes on the floor. Speaking to Elijah, he was even more rude and said, “Man of God, come down quickly.” Again, Elijah roasted them. When people disdain the anointing, it may cost them their lives.<br> Years ago, when the military was ruling in Nigeria, the then-military head of state wanted to become a democratic ruler. His spiritual advisers told him that what he wanted to do would not succeed because of a man called Adeboye, who was always praying for the country in the Redemption Camp (now Redemption City). I was in the camp when one of my children who was privileged to hear the information came and said, “Daddy, you have to travel quickly, they are coming for you.” Although I am anointed, I was troubled. Fortunately, my wife wasn't there when the message was delivered. Later that night, I told her that I wanted to go and pray. While I was praying, God spoke. He said, “Don't worry about him, I have taken care of the situation.” Though it was the month of June, God told me to tell people to wish each other a happy new year during the Holy Ghost service. The Holy Ghost service held on a Friday, and by Sunday, the military dictator had been removed permanently. <br>Don't joke with the anointing.

      "An electric iron is really just a piece of iron until it is connected to electricity. When you connect an electric iron into electricity, it becomes something you can smoothen your rough clothes with. A television basically a screen with some components and wires attached to it. When there is no electricity, it is just there, capable of nothing. However, the moment you connect it to electricity, you will be able to see what is happening in another part of the world in real time. This is how the anointing works, it changes the ordinary to the extraordinary.<br> In Judges 15:14-15, when they brought Samson before the Philistines, and they began to rejoice, the Bible says that the Spirit of God came mightily upon him and the ropes binding him were burnt as with fire. Then, he grabbed the jawbone of a dead ass, and as soon as the jawbone came in contact with the anointing, it became a weapon of mass destruction. The anointing turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.<br> Electricity, in its raw form, is like fire. You may not see it that way because it is controlled before it is passed into your house. In the same vein, the anointing is fire. When the Holy Ghost fell on the people at the upper room, they could see cloven tongues of fire on each person's head. The difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle is fire. You can ride up to 100 kilometres on a bicycle using your physical strength, but by the time you are done, they may need to pour water on you. However, if you are on a motorcycle, you will cover the same distance in less time and without stress. That is what the anointing does. When you see a man working like ten men put together, and instead of getting tired, he remains fresh, the anointing is the difference. So, whenever you are anointed, what you are receiving is the firepower to achieve things that are beyond your normal capacity. <br>The anointing is not only for pastors. An anointed doctor will successfully handle medical cases that other doctors cannot handle. An anointed businessman will achieve greater feats than his normal capacity can achieve. When the anointing comes upon you, you are empowered to do more than you can ever imagine. For example, the anointing made Elijah outrun Ahab's chariot (1 Kings 18:46).<br> Beloved, I encourage you to seek God's anointing; it will give you tremendous speed and turn your life around for good.",

      "Many brings about miracles. When they see a man of God lay hands on a sick person and the sick person gets healed, they want to know what passed from his hand into the sick fellow's body that caused the healing. When they say someone fell under the anointing, the question is, what is the anointing? <br>The anointing can be described as 'heavenly electricity', generated by the Holy Spirit. In other words, just like we have electricity here on earth that powers most of our appliances, the anointing is the electricity of heaven. When you see an anointed fellow, that fellow has connected himself to the generator of the anointing in heaven, which is the Holy Spirit, and he now has the heavenly electricity flowing in him. Acts 1:8 says that you will receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you. It is that connection with the Holy Ghost that makes the anointing flow through you. You must note, however, that the anointing is not the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the generator of the anointing. The Holy Spirit is God Himself.<br> How then do you connect with the Holy Spirit in order to get the anointing? The first thing you must note is that He is called the Holy Spirit because He cannot be near anything that is unholy. If you want to connect with the Holy Spirit, you must be holy. God will not anoint a sinner. Amos 3:3 says that two cannot walk together except they be agreed. If you are not holy, the Holy Spirit cannot work in you.<br>Also, just as you connect with a man when you speak his language, you connect with the Holy Spirit when you speak in tongues. The more you speak in tongues, the more heavenly electricity you are generating into your body and the more anointed you will be. You see, how anointed you are depends heavily on how much faith you have. Jude 1:20 says that you build up your holy faith by speaking in the Holy Ghost. So, the more you speak in the Holy Ghost, the greater your faith will be. The greater your faith, the more anointing you will have to do the impossible. You must note also that there are some levels of the anointing that you cannot reach if you don't add regular fasting to your regular prayers (Matthew 17:21).",

You may then ask, “Why have I not been able to perform any miracle thus far?”<br> In Mark 3:13-15, Jesus' disciples were told what to do. They were to keep Him company, preach, heal sicknesses, and cast out demons. The reason most Christians have not been working miracles is that they have not been following this order. How much time do you spend fellowshipping with God? This is the first step in working miracles. You must spend quality time studying your Bible and praying daily. The more time you spend in His company, the more His power will rest on you. <br>You are also required to preach the gospel. In Matthew 28:19, Jesus said,<strong><em> “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” </em></strong><br>Many believers don't evangelize. God will not give you the power to work miracles just so you can show off, He will only do so if you will use it to win souls for Him. If you get these first two steps right, the power to work miracles will follow duly.<br> Many people feel it is not compulsory for them to have the power of God. If I feel it is not compulsory to heal, then I won't pay the sacrifice that will make healing easy. If I am not concerned when somebody dies, I won't pray much before I ask the family members to arrange for the burial of the fellow. If you truly understand that God is expecting you to be the channel through which He will heal the sick and raise the dead, that it is a must that you cast out demons and that some demons won't leave except by prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21), your attitude to food and pleasure should change.<br> If you are His disciple, according to Mark 3:13-15, you are expected to heal the sick. Every now and then, God will send you to raise the dead, cast out demons, and cleanse people with incurable diseases (Matthew 10:7- 8).

      "There are many people who have received an impartation of God's anointing; however, miracles are yet to happen through them. When a fellow receives the anointing, it remains dormant in him or her until it is stirred up. When Elisha got Elijah's mantle, it remained an ordinary cloth until he used it to strike the river and asked the river to part.<br> I once attended a Kenneth Hagin meeting in Tulsa, USA, and saw a raw demonstration of the power of God. I made up my mind to see him, and by God's grace, I was able to. He asked me, “Young man, what do you want?” I replied, “Sir, I want everything in you that has made you who you are.” After attending to everyone else in his office, he turned to me and said, “Young man, kneel down.” I knelt and saw his two big hands coming towards my head – that was the last thing I remembered. By the time I came around, I was on the floor, and he was kneeling by me with his hands on my head while praying furiously in tongues. <br>When we returned to Nigeria, I begged Papa, the General Superintendent of RCCG, to let me line people up and pray for them. In those days, we didn't pray for anybody, everyone prayed by themselves. Papa allowed me, and so, during the evening service on that Sunday, we lined people up. Some people who had been in Tulsa with me saw that people fell when Kenneth Hagin laid hands on them, so, they came to stand behind the people that were lined up to catch them if they fell. I laid hands on the first fellow, but he didn't fall. I wasn't discouraged because I knew that people falling is not necessarily an indication that miracles have happened. However, by the time I got to the seventh fellow, someone fell under the anointing. After that, a couple of others also fell. I stirred up the gift that I had received and then saw it work mightily.<br> If hands have been laid on you, or you have been anointed by a man of God, it is not time to relax. The impartation will remain dormant if you don't use it. Look for opportunities to pray for people and stir up the gift. The first fellow you pray for may not be healed immediately, however, keep stirring the gift, and soon, you will see it work mightily.",

      "Consecration means being totally surrendered to God, in other words, holding on to Him and Him alone. Unfortunately, a lot of people hold on to Jesus with one hand and hold on to the world with the other. How do you explain Christians who claim to have given their all to Christ but who still consult witch doctors over challenging situations? Truly consecrated Christians are ready to go all the way for God. Such people may go through a lot of suffering for the Lord, but they will still count it all joy, as long as God is with them (James 1:2). <br>A good example of a genuinely consecrated person was Apostle Paul. He was totally sold out to God, such that even when God warned him about being apprehended in Jerusalem, he still went there to preach the gospel (Acts 21:11-14). He was so consecrated that he declared in Galatians 2:20: <br><strong><em>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. </em></strong><br>Consecrated people care about God more than anyone or anything else. I was watching an interview on Dove Television one day, and the guest said that in the past, all Christians cared about was for God to use them, but nowadays, people are more interested in how they can use God. Many people just use Christianity as a cover-up to look good in the society, but when a little test comes, they denounce Christ. For example, these days, many Christians compromise their faith to get married. They wear revealing outfits to attract men, attend ungodly gatherings with the hope of finding suitors, and worse still, engage in premarital sex. <br>A missionary's inspiring story greatly impacted my decision to be consecrated to God. She was serving in an area that was hostile to Christianity. On her wedding day, while she was getting ready, the authorities raided her home and arrested her for preaching the gospel. Instead of crying, she smiled, kissed the handcuffs and said, “Lord, I didn't know I was so special to You that You didn't want to share me with anyone else. How beautiful is Your wedding ring to me.” She was so sold out to God that while others saw a disaster, she saw the handcuffs as God's wedding ring to her as His bride. <br>Beloved, are you consecrated to Jesus?",

This tells us that He took that prayer very seriously. Yet, Jesus still decided to go through with the suffering. <br>Jesus did not lay down His life out of compulsion. He said clearly in John 10:18 that He laid down His life willingly. That statement is heavy, and it made me ask, “What kind of love will make a man surrender Himself to be humiliated and slaughtered like this?”<br>I saw the perfect answer to my question in John 15:13 which says: <br><strong><em>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</em></strong> <br>This is the greatest kind of love in the world. Jesus loves you more than anyone in the world can ever love you, and He showed it by laying down His life for you. <br>Again, I asked myself, “What will make a man surrender His life like this?” I saw the answer to this question in John 10:11-12. The Good Shepherd never deserts the sheep when He sees a wolf coming. He stays and protects the sheep from being devoured because of the love He has for the sheep. The devil is the wolf that tries to steal, kill and destroy, while Jesus is the Good Shepherd that laid down His life for you to have eternal life. <br>Jesus is the only genuine protection you can get from the claws of the wolf – the devil. If you believe in Him, and surrender your life to Him, the wolf will have no power over you because Jesus has already died for you. The wolf, however, is free to devour anyone that is not following Jesus or believers that stray away from Him. <br>Beloved, if you don't want to be prey to the devil, give your life to Jesus Christ now.

      "When Jesus Christ was on the cross, He appeared to be helpless. This was a man who could call 12 legions of angels to come to His rescue, yet, He was nailed to a cross, and it seemed like he was helpless. Truly, what can a person whose hands and feet have been nailed to a cross do? For example, while Jesus was on the cross, he said, “I thirst.” Instead of giving Him water, they gave Him vinegar, and He could do nothing about it. This was not because He did not have the power to do whatever He wanted, but because if He had saved Himself at that time, you and I would have become preys to the devil. So, because of His love for us, He was helpless. He became helpless so that you can be helped. If you have been washed by the blood of Jesus, you will never lack help, in Jesus' name. <br>On the cross, Jesus was lonely. He cried in Matthew 27:46, “…My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.” He was not even talking about how His disciples forsook Him. They left Him when He was arrested, but now, even God forsook Him. That was the biggest heartbreak for Him because there had never been a time when God was not with Him. However, He went through all that so that God can be with you always. He went through that gruelling experience so that you will never be alone and so that whenever you call on God, He will answer you. <br>Everything that happened at Calvary was sorrowful for Jesus; you cannot experience such pain and shame and not be sorrowful. He, however, put Himself through that sorrow so that you can have joy. Therefore, if you are truly washed in the blood of Jesus Christ, everything causing you sorrow is banished now, in Jesus' name. <br>He did it all for you to have a life that is beyond what this world can give you – eternal life. The question now is, are you enjoying the benefits of the sacrifice He made for you on the cross? Are you truly washed in His blood? Are you living your life like Christ? The benefits of the sacrifice He paid are only for those who live holy. Anyone who truly lives holy will experience the benefits of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.

Romans 14:12 says that we are all going to give an account of ourselves before God. The messages you read in this devotional are not for everybody, they are for you in particular. <br>Whenever David wants to talk about something very serious, he personalises it. In Psalms 23:1, he said, “The Lord is MY shepherd; I shall not want.” He didn't say, “The Lord is our shepherd.” Whenever some brethren want to close a service, they will say, “Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow us all the days of our lives, and we shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” I always wonder where they got that from because it is not written in my Bible. What is written is, <strong><em>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever” </em></strong>(Psalms 23:6). Goodness and mercy are not for us they are for me.

I cannot thirst and hunger for God on their behalf. Don't let someone else's lack of hunger for God affect you, even if he is your pastor. Your walk with God is personal.

Don't let the devil deceive you with flashy things. Mark 8:36 says that all the material gains in the world will profit you nothing if you lose your soul. Beloved, please do not trade your soul for material gains by stealing. Nothing at all in this world is worth your soul. <br>God frowns strongly at stealing. If you desire to have more, work more. Do not take from those who have laboured for their possessions. Some people try to categorise and rationalise stealing. For example, some people will say corruption is not stealing. Some will even try to explain why internet fraud is different from stealing. Beloved, the moment a person takes something that does not belong to him or her without the permission of the owner or under false pretences, that fellow has stolen. <br>In 1 Corinthians 6:10, the Bible makes it clear that no thief will enter heaven. The devil is the father of thieves because, according to John 10:10, stealing is his first assignment in any man's life. My father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, used to say that your father will take care of you with whatever he has. If your father is God, then He will take care of you with healings, blessings, and long life, but if your father is the devil, he will take care of you with sicknesses, marital problems, death, and the like. Thieves should never expect God to answer their prayers because God is not their father. <br>In Leviticus 6:4 and Exodus 22:1-4 God said that if you have stolen something, you are to return it to the fellow you stole from in double fold.

      "There are many people who become born again\xa0and say that they don't want to preach the gospel. They think that as long as they don't backslide, they are fine. This is a fallacy. You have joined yourself to the Vine, and John 15:2 states clearly that every branch that is joined to the Vine must bear fruit. It is a must to bear fruit if you want to continue to be a part of the Vine. <br>Do you want to be a part of the Vine? You must do the work of an evangelist. Backsliding as a believer does not only start with drawing away from God and committing sin. Refusal to preach the gospel is also a form of backsliding. John 15:6 tells us that any branch the Father cuts off is going straight into the fire. <br>Some people who preach about unlimited grace usually say that once you are born again, nothing can ever send you to hell; I disagree completely with this theology. When people become born again, they become a part of the Vine, but if they do not produce fruits, they will be cut off from the Vine. When a person is cut off from the Vine, he or she will dry up, and men will gather whatever is left to be thrown into the fire – that is clearly what the word of God says. So, in your own interest, make sure you are bearing fruits for the Most High God. <br>Another reason you must win souls is so that your prayers can be answered. John 15:16 says: <br><strong><em>But I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. </em></strong><br>I don't know if you have observed that it appears as if God often sends the answers to the prayers of baby Christians relatively promptly. You probably experienced those prompt responses to your prayers when you freshly became born again, but now, does it appear as if you sometimes command mountains to move, and it seems like they refuse to yield? Has God changed? Does He no longer fulfil His promises? Why then are your answers being delayed? It just might be because you have not been winning souls.",

    bodyText:
      "In our memory verse for today, the Bible says, “I must do the work,” not “I may do the work.” It is neither an option nor a piece of advice. Doing God's work is compulsory for all His children; this simply means that you have no choice in the matter. In 1 Corinthians 9:16, Apostle Paul said: <br><strong><em>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! </em></strong><br>When it comes to doing the work of God, you must not see yourself as a volunteer. Apostle Paul said doing God's work was a necessity, and he even went ahead to pronounce a curse on himself if he did not preach the gospel of Jesus. <br>Apostle Paul clearly did not see himself as a volunteer. God does not use people who see themselves as volunteers. Once God chooses someone, the fellow has no choice but to do the work. In John 15:16, God said you have not chosen Him, but He has chosen you. The moment He chooses you, the moment you find yourself as a minister of God, you must do what He wants. In Philippians 1:20, Paul said:<br> <strong><em>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. </em></strong><br>Workers are not volunteers but soldiers that must do the bidding of the One who has called them. 2 Timothy 2:4 says: <br><strong><em>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this Iife; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. </em></strong><br>Whether we like it or not, this world is a war front. We are at war and so, we should not distract ourselves with mundane things. We must be focused on obeying the commands of our Commandant promptly and completely. We must do the work required of us by Him so that we will be victorious. <br>In Matthew 28:19, our Commandant gave a command that directs those of us who call ourselves His workers and ministers to go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. The assignment is very clear, and it is a direct order. There is no room for deliberation; act now!",

Beloved, if you are in such a situation, I bring good news to you. Curses placed by men can be cancelled, and I pray for you today that all curses placed on you are cancelled, in Jesus' name. I<br>n Joshua 6:26, Joshua placed a curse on Jericho and from that moment on, the people of Jericho suffered under the curse. Many prophets came and went, but the people of Jericho continued to suffer in silence under the curse. At last, when Elijah was taken away, they realised that if they didn't do something about the curse, their land would remain barren, and death would be rampant amongst them forever. So, they called on Elisha to help them. In 2 Kings 2:19-22, Elisha said, “Go and bring me salt in a new cruse.” They brought it to him, and he took it in his hands, went to the source of their river, poured in the salt and said, “Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.” From that day, the curse was cancelled. <br>Any curse on your life or family can also be cancelled today if you refuse to continue living under it. All you need is a person with a higher power and anointing to break the curse. If the curse was placed by your biological father, you can go to your spiritual father, and he can cancel the curse. This is because the spiritual controls the physical. Also, if it was placed by a man or woman of God, go to a minister of God who has a greater anointing than that fellow, and he or she can cancel the curse. If the curse was placed by a witch or wizard, an anointed man or woman of God can cancel it because the anointing breaks yokes (Isaiah 10:27). <br>Beloved, you must, however, also note that beyond going to any man or woman of God to cancel curses on your behalf, you must seek God's anointing as well. You must pray, fast, study your Bible, and fellowship with God so much that you begin to carry His glory and power. When you do this, no curse can rest on you. If God is with you like He was with the Israelites in Numbers 24, you will be blessed, and no curse will be able to rest on you.",

      "The story I shared yesterday reminds me of three Ugandan boys I met at the Christian programme in Kenya. Those boys were probably hungrier for God than any of us at that programme. During break times, while everyone was buying sandwiches, those three boys would sit together, singing praises to God. I asked why they never ate when everyone else ate, and they responded that food was not their concern. Firstly, they had no money to buy food. Secondly, they said they were praying to return safely and not get arrested or even executed by the then-Ugandan military ruler upon their return. For three days, they had eaten nothing and were just glad to be there. For the rest of our stay, whatever little I had, I shared with them. I told them to write to me when they got back home safely, and they did to the glory of God. <br>Your hunger for God should be such that you won't even remember to eat when it is time to seek Him. You should be so hungry for God that you are willing to risk your life just to know Him more. I get amazed anytime we call a fast, and some people grumble. They are not hungry for God enough to fast for just a few days in the year to draw closer to Him. <br>In the 1970s, I used to gather some RCCG youths in a place called 'Youth Camp'. Accommodation and feeding were usually included in our payment for the venue, but people rarely cared to eat after the sessions. I usually had to beg them to eat so we would not waste the food. They didn't care much for food, they only wanted the word of God. Jeremiah 15:16 says: <br><strong><em>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts. </em></strong><br>What exactly are the things you are hungry for? Food? Fame? Money? Put them all aside and let your hunger and thirst every day be for God. Matthew 6:33 says: <br><strong><em>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</em></strong><br> Beloved, please get your priorities right. David, in our Bible reading today, said that his soul will follow hard after God. Can you say the same for yourself?",

      "Nowadays, many churches are set up to make the congregants very comfortable; this is fine. However, we must not get carried away such that we prioritise comfort over why we really come to services – to have an encounter with God. Whether there is comfort or discomfort, when you know that God is in a meeting, forget your social status and rush there! Don't go for Christian programmes to look for comfort; there are no big men in the house of God (James 2:1-9). If you go to church to flaunt your social status, there is something deeply missing in your Christian life. <br>The first time I went to a Christian programme outside Nigeria was in Kenya around 1975. Our group could not afford a hotel or even travel tickets. We had to pray for God to provide the tickets, and He did. Fortunately, there was a boarding school with dormitories that were made available for free to anybody coming for the programme. I was a university lecturer, and there were so many of us in those dormitories, but I didn't care; we weren't there to show off, we went to seek the Lord. Thank God I went through that because I can never forget the experience; that was the first time I saw God's throne room. I will gladly sleep on the floor to see God's throne room. <br>One thing I know about God is that you must search for Him if you want to truly know Him. This is why Isaiah 55:6 says that you should seek Him while He may be found. You have to seek God diligently if you really want to get to know Him. When you are seeking His face concerning something, how comfortable you feel should not be a hindrance. <br>I remember one time when I had been praying concerning a matter for about two years. I was invited to preach at a meeting, and that was where God answered me. If I had missed that meeting, I might never have heard from God concerning the matter. God shows up when two or three are gathered in His name, so, if you have been seeking Him concerning a matter and He hasn't shown up, go to a fellowship where people are gathered in His name and remind Him of His promise in Matthew 18:20. After the fellowship, whatever discomfort you may have experienced in seeking Him would be gone, but your encounter with Him will remain forever. Sometimes you may have to choose between getting your miracle and comfort – I hope you choose wisely.",

      "Over the past two days, I have been discussing some lessons from Philippians 3:10, and today, I will be going even deeper. Apostle Paul said clearly that he wanted to know the fellowship of Jesus' sufferings; in other words, he wanted to partake in the sufferings of Jesus Christ. Ordinary Christians don't pray this kind of prayer; the prayer of the ordinary Christian usually sounds as follows, “God heal me, set me free, give me a car, prosper me, promote me, make me fruitful.” You won't hear an ordinary Christian praying, “God, let me suffer for you.” I pray for you that you will leave the company of the ordinary today and enter into the company of the extraordinary, in Jesus' name. Paul was a great example of an extraordinary Christian. He was eager to know God and to suffer for the gospel of Jesus Christ. <br>Romans 8:16-17 says: <br><strong><em>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint\x02heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. </em></strong><br>It is when we suffer with Jesus that we can be glorified with Him. Paul said, “Let no man trouble me, I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ” (Galatians 6:17). In other words, he was saying, “I have scars to show that I suffered with Him.” <br>God glorifies those who are partakers of the sufferings of Christ. It's just like a responsible man whose wife suffered with him during tough times. When things get better, there will be nothing money can afford that he will not buy for her. One of the reasons I value my wife greatly today is that when I resigned from lecturing and moved into the middle of nowhere, telling everyone that it is a city that God promised me, she moved in with me. It was tough, but she backed me all the way and partook in my suffering. Now that things are better, she is partaking in the glory. <br>Are you seeking for opportunities to experience the fellowship of Jesus' suffering? Have you suffered with Him in any way? Congratulations if you said, 'Yes' genuinely to these questions because when it is time to be glorified, you will be glorified with Jesus. If you, however, are among those denying Him, remember that He said that He will also deny such persons before His Father in Heaven (Matthew 10:33).",

      "When Apostle Paul said that he wanted to know the power of His resurrection in Philippians 3:10, he was saying that he wanted to know the power that raised Jesus from the dead. There is a power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. That power, according to Romans 8:11, is the power of the Holy Spirit, the power that can quicken your mortal body. That power is still available to the children of God even after Jesus Christ died, rose, and went to heaven. <br>It is a great thing to be baptised in the Holy Spirit. However, there is an experience and encounter that goes far beyond being baptised in the Holy Spirit. When you are baptised in the Holy Spirit, you speak in tongues, but speaking in tongues is not enough; you need to be baptised by fire too. Speaking in tongues is wonderful, and I encourage it, but you can't go to some nations, get into their marketplaces, and start speaking in tongues and think you will win souls for Christ; you might lose your head or spend the rest of your life in prison! You need the fire of the Holy Ghost. <br>Whether you believe it or not, every force that is in heaven, on earth, or underneath the earth, is subject to that power that raised Jesus from the dead. This is why the world fears Pentecostalism. If there was one dead fellow that the devil did not want to rise, it was Jesus Christ, because he knew that if Jesus rose from the dead, he was finished. However, that power that raised Jesus from the dead was so powerful that with all the things that the devil tried in Matthew 27:62-66, Jesus still rose from the dead. He is higher than all principalities and powers, and His rising from the dead opened the door for you and me to also be higher than them. Ephesians 2:6 says: <br><strong><em>And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: </em></strong><br>The scripture above shows clearly that believers in Jesus Christ are now seated with Him in heavenly places. Once you know that power that raised Jesus from the dead, no witch, wizard, demon, or principality will be able to overcome you. You will begin to command demons, and they will obey speedily. If you want to know that power, pray today's prayer point with all your heart.",

To know God the way He ought to be known is very beneficial. If you know Him as He should be known, you will gladly surrender your life completely to Him. You will gladly surrender your future to Him because you will suddenly say, “What am I anyway, that did not originate in God? Who am I anyway, if God didn't make me who I am? What can ever happen in my future that He doesn't know already?” Total surrender only becomes possible when you truly know Him. You can only go wherever He asks you to if you know Him as you should. <br>A young married couple came to Africa for a missionary trip on their honeymoon. While walking around, they came across a really huge fence with gates. They found the gateman and asked, “Who are the people behind these walls?” The gateman answered, “Lepers,” and the couple asked another question, “Has anyone preached the gospel to them?” The gateman said, “Anyone who goes in there doesn't come out. We throw food to them over the gate.” The couple insisted that they needed to go in to preach to them. The gateman reiterated that anyone who goes in never comes out. The husband looked at his wife, and she said, “What the Lord said is ‘go’. He didn't say anything about coming back.” That was one couple that really knew God! <br>You can't know God through preaching, you can only know Him if He reveals Himself to you. I never went to any Bible college. Even though I learnt a lot from my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi and Pa S.G Elton, God had to reveal Himself to me. Only God can reveal Himself to you, and this was why Jesus said to Peter, “Flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven” (Matthew 16:17). The first time I heard people praying, “Oh God of Adeboye, come and do this for me,” I was shocked, and I asked myself, “Who is Adeboye?” However, somebody must have thought to himself, “We may not know God so well, but there is somebody who knows Him.” I pray that you will know Him the way He ought to be known, in Jesus' name.",

Another question which I consider even more important than the initial one is, when your time is up on earth, what account will you give to God of how you spent your life? Hebrews 9:27 says: <br><strong><em>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: </em></strong><br>In other words, death is not the end of our existence, but rather a transition to another state. One way our lives carry on after death is through the things we are remembered for. There are those whose remembrance brings gladness and joy, while the remembrance of some others brings bitterness and sorrowful memories. <br>One woman who was remembered for good after she died was Dorcas. She was one of the early believers in our Lord, and she lived a good life of service and righteousness. This is the testimony of her life as written in Acts 9:36:<br> <strong><em>…this woman was full of good works and alms deeds which she did. </em></strong><br>A lesson here for us is that our good works play a great role in showing our faith and commitment to God. Speaking on this, James 2:15-17 says: <br><strong><em>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. </em></strong><br>The gospel of Jesus must find practical expression in your life through your good works; the testimony of the brethren concerning Dorcas confirms this. She was so full of good works that the church found it difficult to accept her demise, and so, she was brought back to life. Psalms 112:5-6 says: <br><strong><em>A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.

When a person lives for God, he or she would not abuse any privilege or opportunity. <br>Joseph is a good example of someone who lived for God and his fellow human beings, particularly his brothers. Even though they eventually repaid him with evil, his selfless service made him go the extra mile to find them and deliver their food to them when he couldn't locate them initially. He could have returned home with the supplies he took with him, but he didn't. You can find the story in Genesis 37:13-28. Joseph's love for God caused him to reject the sexual advances of his master's wife. He could not bear doing anything that will displease God, and this made him say in Genesis 39:9: <br><strong><em>There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</em></strong> <br>Furthermore, his love for people made him interpret the dreams of his fellow inmates, which led to him becoming the Prime Minister of Egypt. When he eventually came into power, he did not consider the hardships he endured due to the cruelty of his brothers when they sold him into slavery. The love of God in him made him realise that his sufferings served a higher purpose for God and humanity. He said in Genesis 50:20: <br><strong><em>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. </em></strong><br>Our Father in heaven wants us to live a selfless life so that we can attain the fullness of His purpose for our lives.

      "The more we are in our local assemblies, the merrier our services will be. If we are not many, how can we make a joyful noise? The more we are, the louder the noise we can make, and the merrier it will be to praise God together. Let me tell you what I believe to be the origin of clapping. One day, the fingers woke up and heard the birds singing, and they said, “O God, we also want to praise You.” They tried to make a sound individually, but no sound came. Suddenly, they said, “If two of us should cooperate, maybe we can produce some sound.” So, one finger cooperated with another finger, and they discovered that there was a little snapping sound. They took it further, and one finger cooperated with the other palm. They made a better sound, and then another finger decided to join in. The sound improved, and yet another finger joined in. Before long, all the fingers were jamming together in praise, making a joyful noise to the Lord. <br>In the same token, the more we are, the greater our impact will be in the world. When we are many, the impact we will make cannot be ignored because it will be significant. When ten people come together against a policy of the government, the government can easily ignore them. However, when 10,000 people come together to speak against the same policy, it will be very difficult for the government to ignore them. The governing powers in the environment where your local assembly is situated will take you more seriously when you are many. As a result, your local assembly can influence the culture and policies in that environment. <br>When we are many, projects become easier to accomplish. When ten people come together to do something, they will have to put in a lot of effort and personal resources to get it done. However, if 100 people come together to do the same thing, they obviously will need less individual effort and personal resources to get that thing done. Therefore, projects are done faster and easier when we are many. <br>Beloved, if truly God is your father, you should be committed to the expansion of His kingdom. Preach the gospel anywhere you find yourself and set a personal target to win at least one soul to Christ per day. If you cannot go to the mission field, support missionaries with your prayers and your personal resources. The more Christians we have around the world, the greater our impact will be.",

      "After Jesus' resurrection, He showed Himself to His\xa0disciples. He did this for two major reasons. The first was for them to see Him and know that He wasn't dead but alive (1 Corinthians 15:6). The second reason was to give them final instructions before leaving the earth. What instruction was so important that He had to give them before leaving? That instruction is in Mark 16:15-18. <br>Now that He had paid the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus said, “Go and tell everyone around the world that they don't have to perish in hell. If they can just believe in Me, they will have power over sicknesses, demons, and poisons, and also end up in heaven rather than hell.” This is the instruction He gave to His disciples before He left. Are you one of His disciples? If your answer is 'Yes', have you been obeying this instruction? <br><strong><em>Have you been preaching the gospel to sinners? How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomans 10:14 <br>I want you to ponder on the Bible verse above and on the fact that many people will go to hell if no one tells them about the gospel. Ponder on the fact that some of your friends, neighbours, and colleagues may go to hell if you don't tell them about Jesus Christ. A man had a dream where he saw an angel coming from hell with a letter for him. The angel said, “This letter is from somebody who said he knows you.” The fellow was his friend. In the letter, he wrote, “I am here because you didn't tell me about the dangers of this place. In all the years we were together, you did not tell me I was heading for danger.” The man woke up, and as soon as it was daybreak, he went to his friend's house to preach the gospel to him. When he knocked on the door, a fellow came to open it and said, “You have heard?” He responded, “Heard what?” The fellow replied, “Your friend passed away in the night.” This man could have saved his friend from eternal damnation. Give your friends and colleagues the opportunity to escape eternal damnation; tell them about Jesus Christ. Tell everyone you come in contact with about Jesus Christ.",

When I went to the toilet at the backyard before I slept around 10pm, I saw my Father in the Lord praying. Around 5am, I went to the toilet again, and he was still on his knees praying. Later that morning, I asked him if there was any problem as I thought praying overnight meant there was a serious problem at hand. He smiled and said, “There is no problem. Don't worry; you will understand soon.” I was shocked to know that there was no problem, yet he prayed all night. I also knew that God had told me to emulate Him. <br>One pastor came to me years ago and said, “When we started this journey together, we were on the same level. Now you are far ahead of us. Tell us the secret.” I said, “There is nothing I am doing that you don't know; I fast, pray and keep vigils. If you want to be as I am, do the same.” Another man of God from another ministry was praying, “God, give me ten per cent of what you gave Pastor Adeboye; I will be satisfied.” God told him, “Do what Pastor Adeboye is doing, and I will give you what I gave him.” He asked God, “What is he doing?” God said, “He started with 40 days of fasting and prayers.” He said, “God, I think I am okay the way I am.” Only those that are willing to make sacrifices will be great. You cannot be great by loading your body with food and your mind with entertainment – those things only give surface and temporary benefits. Someone with financial issues can watch a funny movie and laugh, such that people will call him a happy man, but after the movie is over, he will go back to face his problems. The benefits of a life without sacrifice are temporary. Don't be deceived by temporary pleasures; pay the price to fulfil your destiny and achieve greatness. <br>The taller a building will be, the deeper its builders must dig before laying its foundation.

Because the fire came on him, he took the jawbone of an ass, and it became a weapon of mass destruction in his hands. <br>When you are anointed, everything you touch comes into contact with the anointing.

Judges 14:5-6 tells us that Samson was going to Timnath when, all of a sudden, a lion roared at him. The fire of God came on him, and he tore the lion to pieces. You need the fire in case the enemy roars, then you can tell him, “I am more than ready for you.” As you grow in the Lord, there is bound to be resistance from the enemy, and you will need the fire of God to uproot obstacles to the work of the Lord. <br>John 4:48 says that some people will not believe the word of God unless they see signs and wonders. These signs and wonders can only happen when you have been baptised with the fire of God. I have been privileged to win many great and influential people to Christ because of the mighty miracles they saw God performing through me. <br>I am going to ask you to cry to God to be baptised with the heavenly fire today so that your life will be filled with signs and wonders.

      "When you see a man of God laying hands on people, and they get healed, it is because those hands have been in contact with the fire of God. Ordinary hands become anointed once they come in contact with the fire of God. <br>In Exodus 3, when Moses threw his rod on the holy ground, it became a serpent, and the Lord asked him to pick the serpent up by the tail. As Moses bent to pick up the serpent, his own hands also brushed the ground that the fire had touched. From that day on, his hands became special. In Exodus 17:8-13, we see those hands deciding the outcome of a war between Israel and the Amalekites. Every time he lifted his hands, Israel won, but when his hands got heavy and were going down, the Amalekites began to win. Aaron and Hur were with him, they had four hands combined, but they knew that Moses' hands, which had touched the holy ground, were different from ordinary hands. So, rather than lift their own hands, they helped Moses keep his hands up. In Exodus 14:16, God said to Moses: <br><strong><em>But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</em></strong><br>God had anointed Moses' hands, so He ordered him to stretch them over the Red Sea to divide it. So, in Exodus 14:21, when Moses stretched out his hands over the sea, it had no choice but to part into two. In Deuteronomy 34:9, those hands also transmitted wisdom into Joshua.<br><strong><em><span class=\"ql-cursor\">\ufeff</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. </em></strong><br>The power of God turns the ordinary into extraordinary. If you read John 9:1-7, where Jesus saw a man who was born blind, He spat on the ground, made some mud out of it and anointed the blind man's eyes. Ordinary mud can become anointed mud; it all depends on whose hands the mud is in. Your hands can also become anointed today, but first, they must be holy hands. Psalms 24:3-4 says that only those who have holy hands can ascend into the hill of the Lord where they can come in contact with the fire of God.",

      "When you are in a service, and everyone is praying that fire should fall, you must beware, because when the fire of God falls, some people die, and some others rejoice. When the fire of God falls, those who do not belong to Him are consumed, while those who belong to Him are empowered. <br>In Daniel 3:19-30, when they threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the fire, their yokes were destroyed by the fire, they walked out of the fire into promotion, but those who were not on the side of the Lord that got close to that fire were consumed. <br>Some years ago, as I was preaching during a service, the fire of God fell. While people were getting their healings, a woman ran out of the service. From outside the hall, she beckoned on the fellow she came with to bring her bag so that she could go home. Surprised, the fellow asked her why she couldn't come in to get her bag herself, and she said that there was fire in the place and she couldn't come in for fear of being burnt. When the fire of God comes down, while it brings healings and promotions to God's children, it can destroy those who are not on the Lord's side. So, before you join those who are asking for fire to fall, if you are not already on God's side, please cross over. <br>I should also note that sometimes, the fire of God comes down unexpectedly in the middle of a service. Even the preacher may be unaware that God is about to rain down fire. When the fire falls, only those who are on Christ's side will be safe. The reason I chose the passage in our Bible reading for today is that I want to speak particularly to those who are workers in the church and who are still dipping their hands into sin. Surrender your life completely to the Lord Jesus Christ because if you are standing by when the fire begins to fall, and you are not on the Lord's side, the result might not be very pleasant. <br>God usually gives room for repentance, but that is until His fire falls. The day the fire falls is the day of consequences – there is no repentance after that. Many are nursing diseases and other terrible issues because when the fire of God fell, they were not on His side.",

Anything that the Holy Spirit has touched has been touched by fire, and when fire touches something, it changes permanently. <br>Exodus 3:1-5 tells us that the fire of God touched the ground of that backside of the desert, and from that moment onward, God called it holy ground. When Moses got there, God told him to take off his shoes because the ordinary soil He had touched had become holy ground. <br>Exodus 4:1-20 tells us how holy the ground was, because everything that touched that ground also changed permanently, such that in verse 20, the Bible says: <strong><em>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</em></strong> <br>After the encounter with the fire of God, Moses left for Egypt, and amongst all the things he took, he took the rod of God. The ordinary rod of a shepherd had now become the rod of God because it touched the holy ground. <br>Some years ago, a woman fell so ill that the doctors said that there was nothing they could do to help her. Her children were advised to take her home so she could die with her family around her. The woman told her children, “Don't take me home; take me to the Redeemed Christian Church of God headquarters.” They told her, “Mama, but there is no service today. The pastor will not be there.” She said, “I didn't say I want to go and see the pastor; just take me there.” They took her to the church, but because she was very weak, she could not walk by herself, so she asked them to help her reach one of the pillars of the building. The moment she got to the pillar and touched it, she became completely healed, and she walked back to the car herself. She experienced a brush with the fire of God through her faith, and she became healed. <br>There is tremendous power in anything that has touched holy ground.

Mark 16:17- 18 says that if you are a believer, some signs will follow you, and this includes healing the sick. When you, however, study Matthew 8:14-18, you will see that the moment you have the healing gift, crowds will come. Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law, and then, in the evening, they brought all those who were sick and demon-possessed. The news spread so much that many people came to Him for healing. <br>If you want to be able to lay hands on the sick for their healing, you must be ready for hard work – you will preach, heal, and comfort the brokenhearted. If anyone is in any form of trouble, they will call on you. You will also have to set the captives free, so demon-possessed people will be paying you constant visits, and according to Ephesians 6:12, casting out demons involves spiritual wrestling. Spiritual wrestling is not for the lazy, so if you want to be anointed, you cannot afford to be lazy. The Lord Jesus had the anointing (Acts 10:38), but in Mark 6:31, He had to tell the disciples, “Let us take a break,” because He became so busy that there wasn't enough time to even eat. If you really want to be anointed, you must be ready to work. I am not saying this to frighten you, I am saying it to get you prepared because someone reading this devotional now is going to get powerfully anointed soon, in Jesus' name. <br>Many years ago, I read 1 Corinthians 12:31 which says: <strong><em>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. </em></strong><br>I realised God approves for His children to be covetous of the best spiritual gifts, so I told God, “Lord, I want double the anointing on Elisha, Paul, Peter, and Jesus when He was on earth.

This is why I am amazed when I see preachers who do not go out of their comfort zones to preach the gospel – preachers who just stay in their local assemblies where they are comfortable and preach from there. They ignore the rest of the world and act as if it is not their business if people go to hell. <br>When you become anointed, your first assignment is to begin to preach the gospel to those that are around you and then progress until you get to the uttermost parts of the world. When you start going out to preach, you will see how many people around the world still don't know about Christ. If you take a walk around Redemption City in Nigeria, there are several banners that show pictures and names of countries where Christianity has hardly gotten to. This is to remind us that we are not called to remain in our comfort zones, but we are to go out and win souls for our Lord.<br>I am 82 years old, and even at my age, I have not stopped going everywhere I can to preach the gospel because I know that it is the very first reason that God anointed me.

      "Many times, when we go to Christian gatherings and the message or sermon being preached starts to sound a bit hard to swallow, there's always a tendency for us to feel that God is talking to our neighbour and not to us. I believe you must have felt like that before. Once in a while, as the preacher is preaching and condemning certain things that make us a bit uncomfortable, we console ourselves by saying, “He can't be talking to me. He must be talking to my neighbour.” Don't deceive yourself when the word hits you; God is talking to you and not someone else. Every time you hear the word of God, don't go pointing fingers. Look within yourself, and wherever you see that you are not living up to His standard, make adjustments immediately. <br>In the Bible reading for today, a prophet came to King David and told him the story of a rich man who robbed a poor man of the only lamb he had. The rich man killed the lamb and used it to entertain his visitors instead of taking one out of the many that he had. David went into a rage and said, “That man shall surely die.” Then, the prophet turned to him and said, “Thou art the man”. Many times, God brings messages like that to us, and just like David, we start to condemn others, but, if we take a moment to reflect on the message, we just might be the ones being described. <br>The way to grow as a Christian is not to assume that certain messages or scriptural verses are meant for other people and not you. Listen or read as if you are the one God is talking to directly. Face the fact that you might not be doing some things right and ensure that you do what must be done to make things right if that is the case. <br>The reason we have many so-called Christians who don't behave like Christ is not because God does not correct them; it is because when He corrects them, they assume He is correcting other people. Unfortunately, if they keep doing that, they will get to a point where they could be destroyed. Beloved, God is speaking to you today. He wants you to surrender all to Him completely without holding anything back. Don't be like those who harden their necks because the end of such people is destruction (Proverbs 29:1).",

In our Bible reading today, Joseph's brothers planned to do evil to him, but they did not know that God had gone ahead to use their evil plot as a means to fulfil his destiny. What a master plan! We see another example in the book of Esther where God had already made Esther the queen before Mordecai began to plot evil against the Israelites. Many times, when we think that some things are happening for no specific reason, we have no idea that God is setting one of His plans in motion. <br>In 1 Samuel 17, the Bible tells us of a big giant that was terrorising the army of a nation on the battlefield for 40 days. Back in the country, nobody knew about the terrorist, but a man sent his young son to take food to his older brothers that were on the battlefield. That young son happened to be David, the man that God had anointed to be the next king of Israel. Before this, God had arranged for David to be trained to kill giants by sending a lion and a bear for him to kill as practice. When you read the story, you will hear David telling the king about the training he had received in the forest which qualified him to face the giant and kill him. <br>Acts 16:9-40 tells us about another clever plan of God. God wanted to save the soul of a man and his family, but because of the nature of that man's work, there was no way he could attend any crusade. As a jailer, he couldn't leave the prison he was working in as he had to look after the prisoners. Therefore, God needed somebody to go to the prison to preach to him. In that story, you will see clearly how God planned it; in a vision, somebody told Paul, “Come to Macedonia and help us.” Paul went to Macedonia in line with the vision, cast a demon out of a girl, and ended up in jail because of a family that had to be saved. <br>Trust God and obey whatever instructions He gives to you.

Not long ago, a friend of mine called very late in the night and said, “Daddy, I have a problem.” He told me the problem, and we ended the call. Soon after, I called my driver, and we left the house. About an hour later when I called him, he thought it was to tell him that I was still praying, but what he heard was, “Please tell them to let me in at the gate.” He was surprised to see me, but I told him, “What are friends for?” Any time of the day that I needed him, he always ran to me. Now that he needed me, I also ran to him. <br>If people show commitment to you, you must also show commitment to them. Many people have lost their right-hand men because they refused to honour them. Whenever it is possible, I usually rearrange my schedule so I can be at the birthday celebrations of some of the people God has placed as my right-hand men. You may not know it, but that fellow who has been very committed to you might have been mocked at one time or the other because of it. There might have been times when you unknowingly did something that offended the fellow, and he or she endured it because of his or her commitment to helping you achieve your vision. In return, whenever you have the opportunity, you must also show your commitment to your right-hand men. That will really go a long way in encouraging them",

      "God can give you a right-hand man, and He can also make you another fellow's right-hand man. None of these two is greater than the other. Whether God gives you a right-hand man or you are someone's right-hand man, when you do your assignment as God intends it, He rewards you greatly.<br>I had such a man in the late Pa Abiona, popularly known as Papa DGO (Deputy General Overseer). When I became General Overseer as a young fellow, I had been in the church for only seven years, and there were people who had been there from the very beginning. Some of these people were determined that I would fail, and there was nothing I said that they did not criticise. Papa DGO, however, had my back all the time. He was old enough to be my father, but he always stood by me. He fought my battles and always ensured my instructions were carried out to the letter, regardless of the complaints from those opposing me. In those early days, there was one town in particular where the brethren often quarrelled amongst themselves. Once I was informed that they were at it again and I mention it to Papa, he wouldn't even let me finish before he would say, “I will go and deal with them.” He is in heaven now wearing his crown of many stars because he was a good right-hand man. <br>In Exodus 24:12-15, when God summoned Moses to come into a cloud, only Joshua went with him. When Moses was leaving the world, Joshua, not one of the elders or the leader of any of the tribes in Israel, but someone you could call Moses' errand boy, was the one God chose to continue the work and lead the children of Israel to the promised land. <br>In 1 Samuel 3:1-9, God called Samuel one night, but he thought it was Eli who was calling him. In the middle of the night when Samuel was supposed to be sleeping, he kept running to answer Eli because he felt Eli needed him – that is a good right-hand man. In return, God gave him the ability to become a kingmaker and a king-remover. <br>Beloved, if the Lord has assigned you to be a right-hand man to someone, consider it a privilege. Ensure you serve to the best of your capacity, and you can rest assured that God will reward you tremendously.",

    memorizeVerse: "Exodus 17:12",
    bodyText:
      "For everyone who becomes great, there is always at least one person God provides to be his or her 'right-hand man'. For example, in Exodus 4:10-16, when Moses told God that he could not go to Egypt because he couldn't speak well, God appointed Aaron to assist him. In Exodus 17:8-13, when the Amalekites came to attack Israel, Moses went to the mountaintop with Aaron and Hur and told Joshua to lead the army in the valley below. Moses lifted up his hands and Israel prevailed, but when his hands got tired, Aaron and Hur gave him a rock to sit on and held up his hands. In the meantime, Joshua was in the valley below fighting. All these people were right-hand men to Moses. <br>We find another example in Genesis 24. Abraham called his lead servant and asked him to get a wife for His son amongst his (Abraham's) people. That lead servant was Abraham's right-hand man in this case. I should, however, also note that the term is genderless, as a woman can also be a 'right-hand man' to another woman. The right-hand man is someone who is close enough to his or her leader to know what the latter needs at every moment, and be proactive in providing it. <br>You should also identify your right-hand man if you haven't. Your right-hand man can say what you cannot say yourself or might have a way of presenting the matter that will effectively pass on your intended message. He or she can be the lifter of your hands, the one who will help you when your hands go weary. Such a person is the one who can provide you with something to sit upon when you are tired; someone who can make you comfortable even at his or her own discomfort. Like Joshua, he or she is the one who can fight your battles even when you are not there. <br>Your real right-hand man is one who, despite your closeness, will never take you for granted because of familiarity. Your right-hand man is one who will see your weaknesses and not use them against you or go around telling others about them; he or she will rather cover them as Aaron and Hur did for Moses. Your right-hand man is one to whom you can entrust things and be sure that they will do it as you want it done. Note that God may have you serve as a right-hand man to someone as well.",

Well, as we see in the Scriptures, God sometimes wants partnerships.<br>In Genesis 2:19, after creating everything, God brought them to Adam and said, “Please name them for me.” In Exodus 14:15-28, when the children of Israel got to theRed Sea and were crying for fear, Moses asked God for help and God said, “I will make a way in the Red Sea, however, I need your cooperation. Stretch your hands across the sea.” If Moses had refused to stretch his hands that day, the book of Exodus might have ended there, Israel might have been wiped out, and God probably might have had to find an alternative way for Jesus to be born. I pray that when God needs someone He can rely on in times of crises, you will be available.<br>Years ago, when we were starting the church in Zambia, I visited the country for the first time. While discussing with my host, we got talking about a man they called Cobra. He was a really terrible and dangerous person. As we spoke, I heard God say that he must be saved. I told my host that I wanted to go and preach to Cobra and asked him to take me to his house. He told me that I was not likely to come out alive. I insisted, and at last, he agreed to take me within a walking distance to Cobra's house, wait for 15 minutes after I enter, and leave if I didn't come out in that time. I said, “No problem.” God wanted me to partner with Him to win that soul, and I knew I had to go. I went in to meet Cobra and within 15 minutes, he was on his knees in surrender to Christ!<br>God needs partners to do His will on earth, but those who will partner with Him must be willing to go all the way for Him. When you hear God say, “I have found a man who will do all My will,” it means that He has been searching for someone to do all His will. Can God count on you to partner with Him and do all His will?",

      "Many ministers of God talk about prayers and lead prayers often, but hardly pray. When it is time for prayers, they announce the prayer point, ask people to pray, and all they do throughout is encourage the people to keep praying; they don't pray in prayermeetings or in private. This is one of the reasons many don't fulfil the call of God on their lives.<br>Apostle Paul was a man of prayer. In 1 Thessalonians 5:17, he said, “Pray without ceasing.” When I want to leave my house on a journey, I pray. When I get into the car, I pray again. When I get on the airplane, I pray again. The Bible says pray without ceasing – keep praying. A songwriter said:<br><strong><em>Christian, seek not yet repose,</em></strong><strong><em>Hear thy gracious Savior say;</em></strong><strong><em>Thou art in the midst of foes: Watch and pray..</em></strong><br>Around 1985, I had tried everything I knew, but the church wasn't growing as I expected. Then, I heard about a pastor in South Korea whose church was growingrapidly, and who usually held a yearly Ministers' Conference. I didn't have the money to go, but I prayed and God sent help. I went and I saw what I had never seen before. I heard the pastor saying on the pulpit that those who had come that Sunday should not come the next Sunday because of space, this was despite holding seven services every Sunday in a hall that could take 50,000 people. During the conference, they took us to his prayer mountain where we were assigned to grottos where we could pray privately. I lost track of time while praying in my grotto and by the time I finished, those who came on the same bus with me had been waiting for me for at least one hour. When I got into the bus, they were angry and asked, “Why have you delayed us?” I said, “I'm sorry, I thought we came to pray.” They said, “Are you going to pray everything in one day?” Nobody spoke to me all the way back and that was fine because, in my heart, I was still roaring in prayer. Some years ago, I went back to South Korea. The first time I went, I couldn't get close to the man of God, but this time, I was able to meet him – Dr Yonggi Cho of blessed memory. He said, “I have heard about you, will you please pray for me?”<br>Beloved, I encourage you to pray always (Ephesians 6:18).",

When Godcalls you for an assignment, He will support you all the way so that you can succeed despite the forces that try to stop you. However, Romans 8:31 says, “If God be for you, who can be against you?” The answer is, 'You!' If God is for you, yet you cannot control your body not to work against you, then you may not fulfil His call.<br>Not only must you stay away from sin, you must also do everything in moderation. You cannot afford to sleep anytime you like, eat as you wish, or be intimate with your spouse as many times as you want.

Paul said that he kept his body under, in other words, I tell my stomach when it is going to eat next and my eyes when they are going to sleep next. People have asked me how I fast for 40 days and nights, and I say, “Simple. The night before I start, I go to an almanac, count 40 days, and mark when thefasting is to end. Then I say to my stomach, 'That date is the next time you will get food.'” The stomach will grumble because it doesn't like that kind of situation. When youdrive along the street, every restaurant on the route will seem to be calling you, and you will smell the food in another house from almost a quarter kilometre away.

When God calls you for an assignment, you must be extremely grateful to Him for the privilege of being called and for every single achievement as you walk in your calling because, without Him, you can do nothing (John 15:5).<br>As I mentioned earlier in this series, I studied people who were called before me and who succeeded in their callings. One of them was Apostle Paul; He was an academic like me before he was called by God. I noticed that Paul was always grateful to God. He wrote in 1 Thessalonians 5:18:<br><strong><em>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</em></strong><br>In our Bible reading today, we see how grateful Mary was for being chosen to give birth to our Saviour Jesus Christ and she succeeded in her calling.

On my way back to the hotel, I discussed the great things that happened in the service with those that were with me. When we arrived, the fellow sitting in the front seat of the car opened the door to get down and as he slammed the door shut, my finger got caught in the door frame. Up until today, I have no idea of how my finger got caught in the doorframe. I cried out in pain and everyone rallied around me saying, “Sorry”. As I went upstairs, I asked God, “Lord, why did you let this happen to me?” He said, “You were talking about all the great things I did in the service and you didn't even turn to Me to say, 'Thank you Lord.'” I realised my error, apologised and thanked Him.

      "Many people that are living in the world today are carried away by the pleasures of sin. They think they are living the life now, but they have forgotten that they should be more concerned with their end than their present state. The time we have on earth is like a passing wind. There is a place where everyone will report to when they close their eyes in death, and we will all be in that place for eternity. My question to you now is, when you get to eternity, on what side will you be, on the side of heaven or hell?<br>The Bible says that when the Lord shall return, He is going to separate the people into two; the sheep will be on His right-hand side and the goats on the left (Matthew 25:31-46). Ask yourself sincerely, “Which side of God will I be at the end?” It is not where I am now that matters most, but where I will end up in eternity. One reason I am not afraid of death is because I am sure that dying in this world only gives me access to the eternal presence of God in heaven. If you are not sure where you will go when you leave this world, then you should be afraid of death. The interesting thing is, whether you fear death or not, everyone has an appointment with it that cannot be missed. When that day comes, I hope you will be on the right-hand side of God.<br>If you are standing for God now, please keep standing. Pray to God that He keeps you standing unto the end because it doesn't matter how long anyone may have served God, if he backslides and death catches up with him in his backslidden state, he will perish in hell as we see in Ezekiel 18:24:<br><strong><em>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</em></strong><br>On the other hand, someone may have been a sinner all his life, but close to when he is to die, if he repents and begins to live like Christ, that fellow will make it to heaven at the end (Ezekiel 18:21-22). It is only those who endure unto the end that will be saved (Matthew 24:13).",

    bodyText:
      "I\xa0have come to understand that the difference between the right and the left hand is more than\xa0their positioning on our bodies. For example, in Matthew 5:30 when Jesus was talking about everything you must do to make sure you don't miss heaven, He said, “If thy right hand offend thee...” He could easily have said, “If thy hand,” but He obviously emphasised the right hand because of its importance. In Genesis 48:8-20 when Jacob was to bless Joseph's two sons, he deliberately placed his right hand on the younger son and the left on the older son. As a result of this, the younger son became more blessed than his elder brother (Deuteronomy 33:17). <br>Now, if the right hand of a man is that powerful, then you can imagine how powerful God's right hand is since we were made in His image (Genesis 1:26). <br>Psalms 17:7 says that God saves by His right hand. In other words, when a sinner is snatched from the jaws of hell, it is God's right hand at work. This is why you must pray for God to raise His right hand on behalf of all your family members that are not saved. Furthermore, Psalms 139:10 says that He leads by His right hand. Isaiah 41:10 says that God also upholds with His right hand. After He has saved you and led you with His right hand, He will also keep you standing with the same right hand. <br>In Exodus 15:6, the Bible says that His right hand is not just powerful, but also glorious in power. This tells us that God fights with His right hand. In Exodus 15:11- 12, the Bible says that His right hand swallowed the enemy. In Mark 14:62, the Bible tells us that the right hand of God is the right hand of power. The right hand of God is also where you will find joy and everlasting pleasures (Psalms 16:11). <br>Beloved, you should note, however, that only the redeemed can be at the right hand of God (Matthew 25:34). If you are not yet born again, you better surrender your life to Christ now because those who are at God's left hand suffer greatly. They are the ones who weep and gnash their teeth because of the evils they experience. Give your life to Christ today and get on the right-hand side of God.",

      "To live and survive on this earth, you need more than\xa0food. Jesus said in Matthew 4:4 that you need every single word that proceeds out of God's mouth. This implies that you must be very particular about hearing from God regularly. Many people think that prayer is a one-way traffic, that is, they go to God, tell Him all their problems, and that is all. No! The most important part of prayer is hearing what God has to say concerning situations. It is the entrance of His word that brings light (Psalms 119:130).<br> Many times, when I face a difficult situation, and I cry to God for help and he does not say anything back to me, I say, “I'm in trouble,” and I continue crying unto Him. When at last I hear from Him, then I know that the problem is over. Even if what I hear is a rebuke, the fact that He is answering at all shows that He has heard me and that something is going to happen.<br> The Bible recorded in 1 Samuel 30:1-18 how David and his men had lost their family members and possessions to the Amalekites and how they recovered all after seeking guidance from God. It was a very dark moment for them before God spoke to them. The men had cried themselves sore and were so dejected that they began to contemplate killing David. Thankfully, David acted wisely and sought the face of God on what to do, and when they acted on God's counsel, they recovered all.<br> In the memory verse for today, Habakkuk said that he will stand upon his watch to see what God's response to him will be. Beloved, what is God saying about the prayer requests you have put before Him? What is God saying about your family, your future, and your career? If you are a child of God, you should note that God also wants to speak to you concerning your situation. Unfortunately, many believers fail to wait on Him to hear what He has to say to them. <br>In Jeremiah 33:3, God said, “Call on me and I will answer.” He didn't say, “I may answer” or “I will consider answering.” He said, “I WILL answer.” So, when you go to Him in prayers, tell Him, “Lord, I will not rest until you have answered me.”<br><br>",

      "Hebrews 11:6 says that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. You only reward someone who has done something of good report and has done it well, therefore, what the passage is really telling us is that God wants people to seek Him diligently. This is why God told David clearly to seek His face, and what was David's response?<br><strong><em> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</em></strong> Psalm27:8 David said, “God, when you ask me to seek your face, my heart says, 'Your face will I seek.'” Today, God is asking you to spend time seeking His face. What will your response be?<br> You seek God through Bible study and prayers. While others do these things like every other activity, those who diligently seek God go the extra mile. They study their Bible for hours, going deeper and deeper into just one topic until they really understand God's mind about that topic. To them, prayer is not an event, it is a lifestyle. Every time you see them, they are praying because 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says that we must pray without ceasing. When they actually set out time to pray, they don't just put words together, they pour out their hearts to God and their major yearning is, “Lord, I want to know You more.” They spend multiple hours just having heart-to-heart talks with God.<br> Beloved, seek God's face daily until you fall asleep and even while you are sleeping. Solomon said that even when He is sleeping, his heart is awake, and can hear his beloved asking to come in unto him (Song of Solomon 5:2). David also described how he thinks about God on his bed at night and how his soul follows hard after God in Psalms 63:6-8. These are descriptions of how true love is expressed. Is this also your experience with God as your beloved?<br> There is great reward in diligently seeking the Lord. Beloved, spend your days seeking God and God alone. Seek Him while you are eating; let all your yearning be for Him. When you diligently seek Him, He will open Himself up in ways that the regular Christian may never see. There are things God has revealed to me in the Spirit that I cannot share publicly because people who have not sought Him diligently may never understand.",

      "There are different kinds of people in the church workforce today. Some are so relevant to the work of God that if they are absent on a service day, everyone will notice. There are some other people, however, who hardly do anything, even in the department where they claim to function. Worse still, there are people who are members of the workforce on paper, but physically, they are nowhere to be found. They hardly attend workers' meetings not to talk of actually working for God. I don't know which of these categories you belong to, but if you are not so active that people can easily notice your absence, then you need to do better. <br>The first set of church workers in the Bible were the seven deacons mentioned in Acts 6:5. Phillip was one of them, and in Acts 21:8, he had become someone referred to as the evangelist. The Bible specifically referred to him as 'the evangelist', which means that there might have been 'an evangelist', or 'some evangelists', but he was 'the evangelist'. Furthermore, the passage referred to him as being one of the seven to remind us that he was one of seven deacons that were chosen. However, asides Stephen and Phillip, we never heard of the rest.<br> One of my grandchildren once asked me, “Grandpa, do you know the Bible very well?” I said, “Yes” then she asked, “Who is Prochorus?” I said, “I don't know him”. She said, “What about Timon?” I said, “You mean Simon?” She said, “No, Timon”. I replied, “I don't know Timon either.” Then she said, “Prochorus and Timon were ordained along with Stephen and Phillip as deacons.” I said, “Is that so? God have mercy on Prochorus. I know Stephen, I know Phillip, but this Prochorus fellow, what did he do that is worthy of note?” In the same vein, when your name is mentioned in your local assembly, can people recognise the things you do that are worthy of note? <br>This is not to say that you must go around trying to show everyone that you are working. However, your impact must be felt in the department where you choose to work. For example, if you are in the sanitation department, everyone must know that if you are around, the church is always sparkling clean.

      "I\xa0have seen people who help others and at every opportunity, refer to the time they helped them. That is a very terrible thing to do, and it is not how God taught us to do good. Jesus said in Matthew 6:3 that when you give alms, you must not let anyone else know about it. In Matthew 5:16, He said that as your light shines and people see your good works, they must glorify God. In other words, you are not to seek any glory for yourself as a result of the good works that you do; all the glory must be to God and God alone.<br> When you help someone, and you go back to tell the fellow, “Remember how I helped you that other time,” you are indirectly trying to make them your prisoner. Don't ever make anyone feel like they owe you because you helped them at one time or the other. When you do good, do it unto God. Don't become a pain in somebody's neck or a source of remembering their shame just because you once helped them. You must note that it is God who ordained for you to perform that good deed for that fellow. He already planned on doing it, you were only privileged to be the one He chose to use. Ephesians 2:10 says:<br><strong><em> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</em></strong><br> If God created you for good works and ordained that you walk in them, and you turn around to announce the good works as your own doing, proclaiming yourself as the helper of someone else's destiny, what you are doing is trying to take God's glory, and if you know anything about God at all, you will know that He does not share His glory with any man. Isaiah 42:8 says: <br><strong><em>I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</em></strong><br> Don't try to contend with God over the good things He is doing in the lives of others through you.

In 1 Samuel 16:1-13, a shepherd boy was anointed to be king, not because somebody liked him or spoke for him, but because God decided to promote him. I believe God wants to promote someone reading this today and that will be you, in Jesus' name.<br> When God begins to promote a man, there is no telling how high He can take him, because His arms are everlasting (Deuteronomy 33:27). 1 Samuel 2:8 says that He can pick a beggar from the dunghill and continue to lift him until he begins to sit amongst princes – that is real promotion.<br> My father was so poor that poor people called him poor. The day he bought an umbrella there was jubilation in our home as if we had just bought a new house. If God could pick the son of a poor farmer and cause him to be someone that Heads of States will be delighted to meet, then you really cannot tell how high He can lift you. He promoted David from being the least recognised member of his family until he became the father of the King of kings (Revelation 22:16). <br>Now that you know that there is no limit to how far God can take you, the next thing you must ask is, “How can I become a candidate for divine promotion?” The first thing you need for God to choose you for promotion is mercy. He said in Romans 9:15 that He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy. He is sovereign; He chooses to promote whomever He pleases. One kind of person, however, that I know God will never ignore is one with a broken and contrite heart (Psalms 51:17). This is when a fellow's will is so broken that all he or she desires is to please God at all times. Such a person never wants to offend God, and whenever they mistakenly offend Him, they become sorrowful and immediately ask for forgiveness. <br>This is the kind of person God was searching for when He needed someone to become the king of Israel. He said in Acts 13:22 that He had found a man who will do all His will. This is the kind of person God will promote. If you are like that, then you have become a candidate for divine promotion.",

He chose you before He said, “Let there be light” in Genesis 1:3. Ephesians 1:4 says:<br> <strong><em>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</em></strong><br>When I see people that are anxious about their future, I tell them, “Relax.

Do you think He is sitting in heaven, scratching His Almighty head and asking for advice on what next to do?” God settled your future before the foundation of the earth. This is why I am not worried; my future was settled before I was born. This is why you should be humble because you didn't choose yourself (John 15:16). You are not chosen because you are educated or connected, it is the exact opposite.<br>1 Corinthians 1:27 says that God chooses the foolish things, the weak things, and the things that are nought. If God chose you, it means you are foolish by human standards; you are weak, and you are nothing by human standards. Even if it appears as if you are wise by human standards, the moment you surrender all to God and begin to live strictly by His standards, the world will begin to see you as a foolish person. So, never raise your head in pride about your achievements. Nebuchadnezzar tried it and found himself in the bushes. For the rest of your life, you must be grateful to God.

      "From today's Bible reading, we see that when God beckons on you, it is an invitation to rest.<br> There is a difference between hard labour and other types of work. God expects you to work. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says that if you don't work, you are not to eat. However, labourers, especially those who labour at menial jobs work from sunrise to sundown. At the end of the day, they earn just enough money to keep body and soul together. I decree that you will no longer struggle before you eat, in Jesus' name.<br> One of the reasons you are reading this now is because God beckoned on you. When He beckons, He is saying, “Destiny is calling you.” In Exodus 3:1-10, Moses was at the backside of the desert when he suddenly saw a bush that was burning but was not consumed. He said, “I will turn aside and see.” That was a beckoning, and by the time He responded, God told him that his days of staying in the wilderness were over, and it was now time to fulfil his destiny. In Mark 3:13-15, Jesus went to the top of a mountain and beckoned to those He desired and they came unto Him. Those people (except Judas Iscariot) later became the Apostles we know today. <br>The first thing you are to do when He beckons is to take up His yoke, in other words, make His desire your concern, and pursue the things He pursues. When you think of the greatest thing that God pursues, it is souls. If you really want to fulfil your destiny, you will take up the yoke of winning souls, and you will begin to see how He arranges things for you to fulfil your destiny. <br>My major pursuit was to become the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa, but God beckoned on me, and I took up His yoke of winning souls. That is how I got to fulfil my destiny and now Vice Chancellors call me Daddy. You have no idea what your true destiny is until you start winning souls and doing the work of God.<br> Just in case you think soul winning is only for evangelists and pastors, please study Matthew 28:19-20 carefully. All followers of Jesus Christ are commissioned to make disciples of all the nations, and this includes you.",

After you have said, “God bless you,” they still say, “Pray for me.” Being blessed by God is a summon to all the forces in heaven, on earth, and underneath the earth to assist you to succeed – that is the meaning of 'God bless you.' Believe it or not, even demons will be summoned to assist you when God is carrying you. <br>A few years ago, I was in an African nation for a programme. As we were heading to the venue of the crusade, we encountered a serious traffic jam. Even though we got a Police escort to help clear the traffic on the way to the venue, we were still stuck as nobody was obeying the Police escort. All of a sudden, a madman came to the front of the car we were in and began to clear the way. The man was so mad that if you looked into his eyes, you could see devils dancing in them. He cleared the way until we got to the end of the traffic jam. When the road was free, he came to the side of the car I was sitting in and bowed. When God carries you, everything will work together in your favour.<br> If you want God to carry you, you must become like a child. In our Bible reading for today, there were many adults around, but the only ones Jesus carried were the children. If you are not like a child, you will be too heavy for Him to carry. This means that you must be humble, obey His word, not hold grudges, and have faith in Him like a child that believes whatever his father tells him",

      "<strong>I</strong>f you want the results of a particular man, copy that man. when Elijah left the earth and dropped his mantle, Elisha took it, rolled it together as his father did, went to River Jordan as his father did, smote the river as his father did, and called on the God of his father to answer him like He answered his father – and God answered! Apostle Paul said, “Follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). The secrets of people's successes lie in the things they do daily. If you can find those things and do them, you will also produce similar results. Romans 2:11 says:<br> <strong><em>For there is no respect of persons with God.</em></strong><br> Our God is not partial; the success He gave to that fellow you admire, He can give to you too if you will do the needful. Genesis 4:6-7 says:<br> <strong><em>And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</em></strong><br> God was essentially telling Cain that if he had done what Abel did, he would have gotten the same result he got. <br>How many books about successful people have you read? How many of them have you watched documentaries about? How many autobiographies have you studied? These are the ways to know what these people did that got them the results they got. In a book, you can learn within one hour things that took a man 70 years to learn. Once you have learnt them, you just have to put them to use and you will get the same results; there's no need for trial and error. This is one of the beauties of the Scriptures and I believe it is the reason the stories of great prophets of the past were recorded for us to read. James 5:10 says:<br><strong><em> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</em></strong><br> You are to take the men of God that have gone before as examples to follow, just as Paul stated in the memory verse for today. You should however note that Jesus Christ is the ultimate model to be transformed and conformed unto. Yes, the children of God are encouraged to learn from those that have gone ahead, but such emulation must be in line with God's will and directives.",

      "<strong>I</strong>n our Bible reading for today, you will see God's mind about follow-up; you will see He doesn't take follow-up lightly at all. He said pastors, and this includes anyone God has put in charge of others, should feed the sheep. When they fail to do so, they are invariably scattering the sheep, and there are woes in store for such persons. He said in verses 7 and 8 that He doesn't just want to be known as the God who brought His children out of Egypt (the bondage of the enemy) but as the Lord who brought His children out of bondage and brought them to their own land (Zion or Heaven).<br> God is never satisfied with you just preaching to sinners. Beyond encouraging them to confess their sins and give their lives to Christ, He is more interested in you following them up until they see Him in glory. Learn from the apostles of old; after Paul had won souls in a place, he would stay with them for a while to ensure that they become grounded in the faith (Acts 18:11, Acts 19:10, Acts 28:29-32). Even after he left, he would keep sending them letters to strengthen them even more. Those are the origins of the letters that we read in the Scriptures today and which strengthen us to date. He also often made out time to visit them so that they may be further established (Romans 1:11). In Acts 15:36, the Bible says:<br><strong><em> And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</em></strong><br> Relating this to modern times, after you have won a soul, get their contact details so that you can keep calling them and sending text messages to strengthen them. You must also visit them to see how they are faring. Visit the local assembly they attend to see if they have joined the workforce there and if they are fervently serving God. Give them the opportunity to ask you questions about their walk with God. New converts always have lots of questions to ask; be there to answer their questions and explain the Scriptures to them. Don't leave them to become prey to the devil; follow them up so well until they are fully established in Christ.",

    bodyText:
      "<p>If God is ever going to use you to bring a harvest of souls into His kingdom,then you must be hardworking. This is because harvesting requires way more labour than sowing. Farmers will tell you that sowing is hard work; if you are going to sow on a large farm, you are going to work hard. However, reaping involves more hard work. This is because there is a time limit for harvesting. If you don't harvest within the time limit, the fruits will rot. The harvest of souls that God has prepared in this end-time revival is great and we have limited time. I pray that God will give you the grace to bring in the harvest, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;<br>When Peter cast his net into the sea in Luke 5:1-10, he did it alone without help, but when the harvest came, he realised that he needed more effort to bring it in. Proverbs 12:27 says that the slothful man will not roast the meat he caught while hunting. Do you know what that means? It takes hard work to hunt and harder work to prepare what was caught so it will not rot. God is not going to waste His anointing on a man who will win souls and not follow them up.<br>Soul winning is an easier job than following up new converts till they mature in Christ. This is why some people prefer the work of the evangelist to that of a pastor. The evangelist gets on a podium, preaches the gospel of salvation, makes an altar call, and leaves thereafter, leaving the pastor to do the hard work of training the new converts, setting them in systems that will help them grow spiritually, answering all their questions, and teaching them regularly until they can stand on their feet. In a time of revival, you must not only be ready to do the work of an evangelist but that of a pastor as well. John 15:16 says that you must win souls and ensure that they abide, implying that they never return to the devil.&nbsp;<br>As painful as it is, giving birth is still easier than taking care of a baby until adulthood. Parents will tell you that the work of a mother over her children never ends. Are you ready to nurture new converts till they make it to heaven? If your answer is yes, then God will really find you useful for His work.</p>",

      "<strong>I</strong>n the Bible reading for today, the various kinds of vessels that can be found in the house of a great man were identified. It says that you will find some vessels unto honour and some unto dishonour. This may make you wonder, why does the great man keep vessels unto dishonour in his house, why doesn't he just throw them away? This is the same question that many ask when they consider the body of Christ today. They say, “Why does God not kill all fake pastors? Why does He not expose all those who are using His name to amass wealth and fame for themselves?” The answer to that is in Matthew 13:24-30. Verses 29 and 30 in particular say:<br><strong><em> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</em></strong><br> Our God does not act rashly; everything He does is for a reason. There are some fake pastors that some genuine Christians believe to be real. If God destroys such pastors, it could affect the faith of those who are following them. As such, the tares would have been gathered but the wheat would have unfortunately been rooted up with them. Don't worry about the mixed multitude in the church, God is coming to separate the wheat from the tares and when He does, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br> If you claim to be a Christian, yet you are bringing dishonour to the Lord, you better change now. If such a person refuses to change, that is not a problem. The fire that will consume him or her is getting hotter every day. Such a person can keep enjoying the benefits of being called a Christian for now, however, God is coming with the reward for such deceivers, and on that day, He will take no apologies. <br>Beloved, if you are one of such deceivers, it is in your best interest to genuinely repent now, forsake your sinful ways, and truly surrender your life to Jesus Christ. It is the only way to escape the judgment that is coming for all those that are vessels unto dishonour.",

Jesus Christ was addressing the Pharisees and He said to them in John 8:44:<br><strong><em> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</em></strong><br> The question then is, how do we tell a child of God apart from a child of the devil? The Bible answers this question aptly. For example, the Bible says that people who love the world do not have the love of God in them (1 John 2:15- 16). This clearly implies that such people cannot be described as God's children. When you see someone who loves material things more than God, that fellow does not have the love of God in him and hence cannot be His child if he or she remains in that state. <br>A child of God on the other hand is one who is born of the Spirit and focuses on spiritual things rather than worldly things. John 3:3-7 says that anyone who wants to enter into the kingdom of God must be born of the Spirit, and of course, only the children of God can enter into His kingdom. This is why you must be born again.<br> Beloved, when you are born again, you are born of the Spirit, and you truly become a child of God. When you are born of the Spirit, you will begin to live by the Spirit and be led by Him. You will begin to exhibit the fruit of the Spirit as written in Galatians 5:22-23.

If you have not yet been baptized in the Holy Ghost, you better ask Him for the baptism. A big revival is here, and He doesn't want to use the pastors alone; he wants to use all His willing and available children. The question, however, is, are you fit for the Master's use?</p><p><br>There are two major things you need to be fit for the Master's use in this revival. They are stated in 2 Timothy 2:21:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If a man therefore purge himself from these,he shall be a vessel unto honour,sanctified,and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The first thing you must do is purge yourself of any iniquity – you must be sanctified. Sanctification comes through constant study and dependence on the word of God (John 17:17).</p><p><br>Secondly, you must be prepared to work. God cannot use you if you are lazy, He only uses people that are prepared to work hard. Proverbs 18:9 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</strong></i><br><br>God describes the lazy man as being just the same as a waster. God won't waste His anointing on you if you are lazy. When He gives you the anointing, it is not the time to relax but the time to work even harder.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, it takes hard work to become a champion, but it takes even harder work to remain one. When you are struggling to become a champion, you stretch yourself and train vigorously. Once you become one, you will suddenly realise that from that moment, everybody starts coming after your crown to take it from you. Clearly, it is better not to have become a champion than to be an ex-champion while still at one's prime. The pain of the ex-champion is not the bruises on his body, it is the shame of walking in the streets and seeing those that had been hailing him as a champion suddenly turn their faces away from him.</p>",

The Peter after Pentecost was different from the Peter before Pentecost. He was now bold and could speak about Jesus Christ to anyone regardless of their status in the society.</p><p><br>Acts 4:13 says that the boldness of Peter and John was beheld by the people around them.

      "Today's Bible reading passage starts with 'Now' .This implies that after the incident that happened before, something new is happening. Acts 2 tells us about the day of Pentecost and how everyone at the upper room was filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. Now then refers to something that was about to happen in the lives of Peter and John as a result of that incident. Clearly, that was the working of miracles.<br> When you get baptised in the Holy Ghost, you carry divine power within you. You have the power to work miracles, heal the sick and raise the dead. Unfortunately, many Christians become baptised and are satisfied with just speaking in tongues. You received more than that when you were baptised in the Holy Spirit; you received the power to go out and do the work of God. <br>Many years ago, I prayed to God for many weeks for power to do His work, but He didn't respond. At last, one night, He told me to keep quiet and began to ask me some questions. “Have you been baptised in the Holy Ghost?” I said, “Yes”. He said, “What is written in Acts 1:8?” I knew it offhand, so I quoted it to Him. Then He said, “You received power after your baptism in the Holy Ghost.” I responded, “Lord, but I don't feel powerful.” He replied, “Did I say the just shall live by feelings?” <br>The next morning, a sick child was brought to me for prayers. I was afraid, but then I remembered the conversation I had with God the previous night, so I laid my hands on the child and prayed. Not long after, I felt the child go numb, and I thought to myself, “Has this child died?” When I finished praying and opened my eyes, I realised that the child was sound asleep. The mother said that the child had not slept in days, but now, she was sure that God had healed her child. <br>Go out and use the power that God has already given to you, if not, it will remain dormant. When I realised that I had been empowered by God, I was hungry to keep laying hands on the sick. That is how I've gotten to the stage where many great miracles happen through me today. I have been using the power God gave me since I was baptised in the Holy Spirit and it has been growing since then.",

      "<p>Yesterday, I distinguished clearly between being a son of God and being a servant of God. I am quite sure that you choose to become a son of God rather than a servant. How then can you become a son of God?<br>Being a son of God requires that you fulfil some obligations. A son is a major stakeholder in whatever the father does. He takes whatever belongs to the fatheras his because he is not a servant but a son. John 10:12 says that the hireling (servant) will not give his life for the sheep, but Jesus, the Son of God, gave his life for the sheep. In the same vein, you must be ready to spend and be spent for the salvation of men on earth. Nothing must be too hard for you to do so that people will not perish in hell. A servant can see souls perishing and turn the other way, but not a son; a son will go out and preach the gospel to them until they give their lives to Christ and remain steadfast in the Lord. If you are not an incurable soul winner, your sonship is in doubt.<br>A son resembles his father. It is only what he sees his father do that he does. That is why 1 John 3:9 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</strong></i><br>True sons of God hate sin. Don't mind those who tell you that once you have given your life to Christ, you can go ahead and commit sin – they are liars! Real children of God have the seed of God in them, and that seed makes it difficult for them to sin. If they fall into sin, that seed begins to bite them, and they become very sorry for what they have done. They go back to their Father, like any genuine child will do, and plead for forgiveness. Nobody can keep committing sin on purpose and claim to be a son of God – that fellow is a liar. A child that does not resemble his father is called a bastard.<br>It was recorded that Jesus loved righteousness and hated iniquity (Hebrews 1:8-9). If you are truly a child of God, you will hate sin and love righteousness because of His seed within you.</p>",

      "Whenever I insist that I am not a servant of God, but a son of God, some wonder if there's a difference between children of God and servants of God. Simply put, a son of God has several advantages that a servant of God does not have.<br>In John 8:35, the Bible says that, unlike a servant, a son abides in the house forever. A servant can resign or be sacked, but a son cannot be sacked. When a father says, “I reject you as my child, I disown you,” it is a joke because his blood is running in the child; he can't take the blood away. Hence, a child will always be in the house. The implications of this alone are many. Psalms 23:6, for example, says: “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.” The one who dwells in the house forever has the assurance that goodness and mercy shall follow him forever. Also, according to Psalms 91:1, “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.”<br>A servant is always a visitor; he comes into the presence of the master when he is needed and goes out when he is not needed. A son, however, is a dweller; he stays in the house all the time. Furthermore, according to John 5:20, the son sees everything that the father does; the servant does not see everything his master does. There is beauty and joy in knowing what God is doing and being able to see ahead of time what God is going to do. For example, years ago, when problems were brewing, I told those close to me, “Trouble is coming, but at the end of it, somebody is going to laugh,” and so it happened because I have the privilege as a son to see what my Father is doing.<br>There are certain things that can happen to servants that will never happen to children. For example, as good as Job was, God called him “My servant,” little wonder God allowed Satan to experiment with him (Job 1:8-12). My Father will never permit the enemy to experiment with my health, resources or anything that concerns me because I am His son.<br>Tomorrow, by His grace, I will commence a study on how to become a son of God.",

      "The temple of God is much more than all I have discussed in this series so far. In fact, if I want to call God's temple any particular name, I will probably call it the house of praise and power. In our Bible reading for today, you will discover why David said:<br><strong><em>I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Psalms 122:1</strong><br>The temple is a house of praise. Psalms 22:3 says that God inhabits the praises of Israel, and we saw a manifestation of this in our Bible reading today. The temple is also the house of thanksgiving because our Bible reading passage today also says that they were thanking God too and not just praising Him (2 Chronicles 5:13). In fact, David says in Psalms 100:4 that you should enter God's gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise. As praise and thanksgiving go on, His glory fills the temple powerfully. So, when you go into the temple, you are actually going into God's glory. That glory rubs off on you, and everywhere you go after that, you just begin to experience supernatural goodness and mercy.<br>God's temple is also a house where goodness and mercyabound. In Psalms 23:6, the Bible says:<br><strong><em>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</em></strong><br>There is a song I love so much, and it goes thus:<br><em>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days, all the days of my life (2x).</em><em>And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever,</em><em>and I will feast at the table set for me.</em><em>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days,</em><em>all the days of my life (2x).”</em><br>Beloved, I encourage you to sing this song prophetically, and if you do not know the song, you can just speak the words into your life. You must, however, go beyond merely singing or speaking the words, you must live it. Dwelling in the house of the Lord precedes feasting at the table set before you. Whether the enemy likes it or not, when you are in the house of the Lord praising and thanking Him, a table will be set before you, and nothing can tamper with it!",

      "God's temple is also a house of grace. Hebrews 4:16 calls the temple the throne of grace. It is the place where you can go and obtain grace and mercy in times of need.<br>You may be in need of strength and grace to overcome a particular situation; the good news is that the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:9 that God's grace is sufficient for you, and His strength is made perfect in your weakness. You receive this sufficient grace when you come into His temple. People who go to the occult for power know that they have to keep visiting the shrine regularly to renew their powers. The devil only tries to copy God's methods; we who own the original must also always go to the temple of God to keep renewing our strength and receive fresh grace to surmount challenges that we may be faced with daily.<br>There are people who, when they have committed a sin, avoid going to church because they feel dirty – that is wrong. At that point, they need the mercy of God and where they can get it is at His throne of grace. That is the time they need to be in church the most. When you get to His throne of grace, go in humility. Even if you are a worker, don't try to keep up an appearance; tell God you have erred and that you are sincerely sorry. Tell Him to please have mercy on you.<br>Many people go to the temple and keep up appearances like the Pharisee in Luke 18:10-14, while some others go in like the Publican in the same passage. This is why many people keep going to church and are yet filled with so much junk within them. Even if you are the pastor of the church, when you are before the throne of grace and in need of mercy, don't put up a false appearance of piety; go before God pleading for mercy.<br>The devil knows that you can always access mercy and grace in the presence of God, so he will do everything he can to discourage you from coming unto Him. He used tohave that privilege of being in God's presence, but he lost it when iniquity was found in him (Ezekiel 28:14-16), and of course, he does not want you to enjoy what he has lost.Beloved, don't let anything keep you away from coming into God's presence to access his mercy and grace.",

However, David went on to say that he not only wants to behold God's beauty, but he also wants to be there to enquire of Him. In other words, if you have any questions for God, bring them to His temple; come and ask Him in the temple.<br>When you come into His temple, you will receive revelations; He will begin to tell you certain things that you will not learn at home. This is why you must always go to church with your writing materials. It is a place to go and learn new things and get new perspectives. There have been many times that I was confused about a matter, but while listening to the word of God, light will begin to shine on the matter, and I will receive revelations on how to resolve the situation.

      "Beyond being the house of prayer and healing, God's temple is also the house of sacrifice. Anyone who wants to sacrifice anything has to take his sacrifice to a designated place. In Yoruba land, where I come from, when they want to sacrifice to thedevil, they take the sacrifice to the crossroad, and when they want to sacrifice to witches and wizards, they put it behind an Iroko tree. For us who give sacrifices to the Most High God, He said in 2 Chronicles 7:12 that He has chosen His temple as the place where He will accept our sacrifices. Furthermore, Deuteronomy 16:16 says that you should not come empty-handed when you are coming to the temple of God because He wants to accept your sacrifice.<br>A friend of mine used to say whenever he was takingofferings, “If you have none, borrow from your neighbour so that when the basket is going round, God will see you putting something in.” Then he would add, “It will not be long before you too will lend to others.” God takes giving a sacrifice in His temple so seriously that He always observes what people drop in the offering basket. In Mark 12:41-44, Jesus watched the offerings that people gave and weighed which ones were sacrifices and which were not. This tells you clearly that God is keen on accepting sacrifices in His temple.<br>Some people say that because they don't trust their pastor, they will rather give to the poor than give in church. First, I don't understand why they have a pastor they believe to be a thief. Secondly, it is good to give to the poor; Proverbs 19:17 says that when you give to the poor, you are indirectly giving to God. However, you must never neglect giving your sacrifices in the house of God itself. If somebody says he likes me and gives my children money whenever he sees them by the roadside, but he refuses to give when he sees that there is a need in my family, despite knowing the way to my house and having money to give, I will begin to suspect such a fellow. It will be clear that he isn't giving to my children because he likes me but for other reasons. This might be because he just wants to be seen in public as a giver or that he wants to gain some undue influence over my children. It's the same when you claim to give to the poor in the name of God but never give in the house of God itself.",

      "The temple is not just the house of prayer; it is also the house of healing. In Matthew 21:14, after Jesus chased all those who were buying and selling in the temple, saying, “My house shall be called the house of prayer,” the Bible says that the sick cameunto Him in the temple and were healed.<br>In our Bible reading for today, Jesus went into the synagogue and met a man with a withered hand. There were some scholars who felt that people shouldn't behealed on sabbath days. When they asked if He would heal the man with a withered hand, He told the man to stretch his hand, and he was healed. Note that the mandid not ask to be prayed for; just seeing a case like that in the temple compelled Jesus to heal him. Some people have challenged me before, saying: “You people who claim that you have the power to heal, why don't you go to the hospital and heal everybody there? Why do they have to come to the church to be healed?” Truly, God can heal anywhere, but He specifically heals in the temple. There are many people who, by juststepping foot on Redemption City, got their healings. Nobody prayed for them; the mere fact that they had entered God's temple brought them their healing.<br>Going to God's temple regularly is like going to the doctor regularly. Even when you are feeling well, and you go to see him, he will examine you, and whatever strange thing he finds in your body, he will deal with it. There are people that are carrying one sickness or the other in their bodies that they don't even know about yet. When you go to church, and the power of God falls on you, such sicknesses disappear because you have come to a place of healing. This is why I wonder if people know what they are missing when they decide to stay at home and watch a church service on TV. If you are far from the place of worship and God sees that you sincerely will like to attend physically but cannot be there, that is a different case. However, when you decide to stay at home and connect to a service that you could have easily attended, you cannot get the same atmosphere as those who are in the service physically.",

I know you can pray anywhere, and God will hear you, but there is a difference when you pray in the place that was originally assigned as the place of prayer. In such a place, the atmosphere is already charged, and there are heavenly protocols in place already to ensure that prayers said there are answered. When a place has been dedicated as a house of prayer, there is tremendous power there.<br>For many years when I lived in the house that is now known as Open Heavens House, I had a small room that I called my prayer room. It is a room that was assigned as a place to pray and meet with God. As a result of the constant prayers that went on there for long hours, a portal between heaven and earth was created there, just like the one we see in our Bible reading for today. Many people had prayed for certain situations without results, however, when they entered that room to pray, testimonies followed. For example, there have been records of people entering the prayer room with glaring physical defects, and by the time they would come out, the Lord would have touched them, and the defect would have disappeared. What made the difference was not so much in the words they said but that they prayed in a place that had become a portal between heaven and earth.<br>When a place has been dedicated as a place of prayer, and intense prayers have been going on there for many years, you better believe that such a place is saturated with immense power.

Such friends will challenge you to do more for God and can tell you the truth when everyone else is afraid to do so. They are people that you can have as a shoulder to lean on when the chips are down.<br>Acts 3:1 says that Peter and John went to the temple. You may ask yourself, after the Holy Ghost descended on 120 people in Acts 2, why is the Bible bringing only these two to our notice? The reason, I believe, is that they were friends who were part of Jesus' inner circle. They were three in that circle – Peter, James and John. Out of these three, Peter and John had a close relationship even before Jesus died. If you read John 13:21-26, at the last supper, when Jesus said somebody was going to betray Him without telling them who it was, Peter beckoned to John and told him to ask Jesus. That is an example of a friend you can ask to pray for you concerning a matter you are not clear about, and he will hear from God for you.<br>After Jesus died and rose from the dead, the link between them obviously grew stronger. In John 20:1-8, when Mary Magdalene discovered that Jesus had risen and came to tell the apostles, two of the apostles ran to the tomb; they were Peter and John. It's interesting to note that John is the one who wrote the story, and he stressed that he outran Peter and got to the tomb first – in fact, he repeated it twice! I always wonder, “Why are you telling us that you beat him so emphatically?” There seemed to be a friendly competition as to who loved Jesus more between them.<br>You need friends you can have healthy competitions with on who can pray the longest, who reads more Scriptures, who wins more souls and so on.

If your prayers are always selfish, God will not make you one of His best friends. In fact, He will not answer your prayers when they are born out of your lusts (James 4:3).<br>Those who will be one of God's best friends are people who pray God's prayers and want to partner with Him to establish His will on earth. They are people who say regularly, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” When such people go to pray, they don't go with preconceived prayer points at all times. They make a habit of going into His presence with a burden to hear from Him about what He wants to be done on earth and to pray those things into existence.<br>Every now and then, God needs someone to stand in the gap for His people, He needs someone to pray about a particular situation so that He can have the legal right to step into that situation. If you are an intercessor, always willing to pray God's will into existence, He will draw you closer to Himself.

      "From yesterday's discussion, I believe you must be very interested in becoming one of God's best friends. If you truly are, you must study those who have been best friends with Him and do what they did. One major thing you will notice about such people is agreat level of faith. <br>Faith is a major attribute that is required of anyone who wants to become God's friend. Those who will be one of God's best friends will not only have faith but have so much faith that they will be doing things that do not seem to make sense according to human understanding. <br>Romans 4:18 says that Abraham hoped against hope – that is a great level of faith! He not only hoped in his heart, but it also showed in his action when he told everyone to start calling himself and his wife 'father of nations' and 'mother of nations' respectively, even when they were old and didn't have a child. Romans 4:19 says that he did not consider his body that it was dead; he believed God like a fool.<br>Can you have that much faith in God that you will begin to say and do things that would make people who do not understand God's ways wonder if you are normal? Will you see the word of God as more real and potent than anything else, including natural laws? When God sees this kind of faith in someone, He draws the fellow closer to Himself.<br>Early in my Christian walk, I learned during a Sunday School class that faith can be likened to when a child jumps from a high surface at his father's instruction without being scared of falling because he knows that his father will catch him. When I heard that, I started jumping without being scared of falling because I know from His word that He will catch me. I noticed that every time I made audacious statements or moves of faith based on God's word, He drew me closer to Himself.<br>You can have a close relationship with God if you can just be audacious with your faith. If you can hope against hope and become a fool to others because of what you so obsessively believe in the word of God, not only will you see His word come to pass in your life, but you will also discover that He has brought you close to Himself to makeyou one of His best friends.",

      "It may surprise you to know that God has best friends. God's best friends are so close to Him that they know things about Him that no one else knows. They are people with an experiential knowledge of Him that most people don't have. Such people don't like to talk deeply about how much of God they know because those who haven't gotten that close to Him will misunderstand them.<br>Abraham was one of God's best friends. He was so close to God that God said He could not do anything significant on earth without first informing him (Genesis 18:17). Moses was also one of God's best friends. He was so close to God that God Himself testified in Numbers 12:8 that He spoke to Moses mouth to mouth and that he beholdsHis similitude which is translated as 'form' in modern English. John the Beloved was another man who was clearly one of God's best friends. Of all the people on earth, Jesus decided to tell him all the things that will happen in the end time (Revelation 1:1).<br>All these people had such a close relationship with God that they saw sides of Him that others never saw. They heard things from Him that they never told others and made Him change His mind on several occasions (Genesis 18:24-32, Exodus 32:9-14). Probably the most obvious example is reflected in Jesus' relationship with Peter, James and John while He was on earth. Because they were with the Lord Jesus Christ on the mount of transfiguration, they saw His glory (Matthew 17:1-2). When He went to raise Jairus' daughter, He allowed only the three of them to follow Him, and so they saw Hisresurrection power (Mark 5:35-37). They were so close to Him that they saw Him in His time of distress at the garden of Gethsemane when He was crying for God to take awaythe cup from Him (Matthew 26:36-39). Jesus invited them specially to watch with Him. These three experienced special moments with Jesus Christ that no one else did.<br>It indeed is a special honour and privilege to be one of God's best friends. I believe every sincere believer should desire to be in God's special inner circle of friends, and so I will be discussing what it takes to become one of God's best friends in the next couple of days.",

      "Today, I will be discussing how needful it is for men to also open a book of remembrance of God's goodness so that they can give Him praise like the psalmist in our Bible reading today.<br>Over the years, I have come to realise that many people easily forget the goodness of God to them. For example, when things are going fine, it is easy for a fellow to be full of praise for his or her Maker. However, when things are not going well, the same fellow may momentarily forget all that the Lord has done for him or her and immediately begin to complain. David also realised this tendency in men to forget what God has done for them quickly, hence the reminder he set for himself in the memory verse of today.<br>After setting the reminder in Psalms 103:2 for himself, David went on to open the book of remembrance of God's blessings upon his life and began to praise Him (Psalms 103:3-5). He praised God for forgiving his sins, for healing him, and for saving him from destruction. He went further to praise God for crowning him with loving kindness and tender mercies. David also praised God for satisfying him with good things and for renewing his strength like the eagle's.<br>Beloved, it is very important that you always remember the goodness of the Lord upon your life. You were created in His image, and this is enough reason for you to thank Him at all times. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross of calvary for your sins and indeed the sins of the entire world is another major reason to be thankful to God at all times. You should thank Him always for saving you from the consequences of sin and all sorts of evil in the world today. Like David, you must give thanks to God for His lovingkindness and tender mercies. The Bible says that you would have been consumed if not for His tender mercies (Lamentations 3:22), so you owe yourcontinued existence to Him.<br>I am sure that I can go on and on, and I still will not be able to exhaust the list of reasons you should praise God at all times.

      "Yesterday, I mentioned some wonderful things that can happen to God's children when He opens the book of remembrance in their favour. Today, I will progress in the discussion by looking at what happens to the enemies of God when He opens the book of remembrance concerning them.<br>In our Bible readings today, the Amalekites attacked the Israelites for no just cause, and God recorded this evil act against them. He also promised to wipe them off from theface of the earth. Many years after, their past evil action against the children of Israel was brought to remembrance, and the Lord commanded Saul to wipe them off the face of the earth. I pray that a negative book of remembrance will never be opened to you, in Jesus' name.<br>Beloved, a terrible book of remembrance was opened to all men because of the sin of the first man and woman in Genesis 3:19:<br><strong><em>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</em></strong><br>This terrible book of remembrance is re-echoed in Romans 3:23 and Romans 6:23. Beloved, the only way to escape the consequences of this terrible book of remembrance that was written because of the disobedience of our first parents is found in the last part of Romans 6:23:<br><strong><em>…but the gift of God is eternal life throughJesus Christ our Lord.</em></strong><br>God has provided only one way of escape from this terriblebook of remembrance, and that way is Jesus Christ (John 14:6). Jesus' blood was shed on the cross at calvary to write off the consequences of this terrible book of remembrance for everyone who accepts Him as their Lord and Saviour. Beloved, if you have not truly surrendered your life to Jesus, there is no way you can escape the ultimate consequence of this terrible book of remembrance, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23). Surrender all to Jesus today and commit to living a holy life if you are yet to do so. Only then can you experience the mercy of God and have the book of life opened to you.<br>I declare that every evil book of remembrance concerning you shall be shut down permanently from today, in Jesus' name.",

      "I prophesy to you today that as you read this, a pleasant book of remembrance will be opened in your favour, in Jesus' name. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the word remember means to be able to bring back a piece of information into your mind or to keep a piece of information in your memory. In Genesis 8:1, the Bible says that God remembered Noah. Ordinarily, one cannot imagine that God can be forgetful and notremember the family He put in an ark. Thus, when the Bible said that God remembered Noah, it could only mean that God was now paying attention to Noah's situation. The same thing applied to Rachel in Genesis 30:22-23 where the Bible says:<br><strong><em>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and open her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son; and said God hath taken away my reproach:</em></strong><br>The above scripture reveals another meaning of remembrance: the taking away of reproach by a higher power. When God remembers a barren woman, she conceives and becomes a mother of children, like in the case of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1:1-28. She had been constantly provoked and humiliated by her rival because of her barrenness, and it seemed like her case was hopeless. However, God remembered her and intervened in her situation when she cried out to Him in Shiloh. When she returned to Shiloh, she was carrying her testimony in her hands.<br>In our Bible reading for today, God intervened in the case of Mordecai against his adversary, Haman. Mordecai and his niece, Esther, prayed, and there was a breakthrough. The king was unable to sleep, and he commanded that the record books be read to him. While this was being done, the good deed of Mordecai that had been forgotten was brought to remembrance. That could only have been God. Nehemiah understood the things that can happen when God remembers a fellow, and that was why he prayed that prayer in today's memory verse.<br>Beloved, I encourage you to ask that the Almighty God should open a book of pleasant remembrance for you this year. I join my faith with yours, and I pray that He will remember you for good all through this new year and beyond, in Jesus' mighty name.",

God indeed desires that you should enjoy all-round wellness, and this includes recovering all that you might have lost to the enemy. I declare that you will recover all that you may have lost to the enemy, in Jesus' name.<br>Our Father in heaven said in His words, “I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:” (Isaiah 45:2). In other words, the Lord is assuring us of His presence as we pass through this new year. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave us an added assurance in John 16:33:<br><strong><em>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</em></strong><br>These infallible words in the Scriptures are an assurance to you that regardless of what you might have experienced in the last year, it shall be well with you in this new year.<br>Beloved, for it to be well with you this year, you must learn a lesson from our Bible text for today. David consulted God before pursuing the enemy, and God assured him of victory. I encourage you to cultivate the habit of seeking divine direction this year as you go about all your lawful endeavours. David, even though He was an army General of high repute, did not rush into pursuing those who raided his camp while he was away. Instead, he consulted with his Commander-In-Chief, Jehovah-Nissi, for divine assurance. God told him to pursue after the invaders, and when he did, he recovered all that they had stolen from him.<br>Are there things you know that the devil has stolen from you? Are there opportunities you believe you have lost? Are there steps you ought to have taken but failed to, and you feel all is over? I want to assure you today that my God can help you recover all if you trust Him and surrender all to Him.<br>I declare once again that as you truly surrender all to Jesus and seek His guidance, you will recover all the losses you may have suffered, and it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.",

      "In continuation of the discussion about God's declaration that it shall be well with the righteous (Isaiah 3:10), it is important to note that the state of a person's health is another indicator of the fellow's wellness. An individual that is always in and out of thehospital because of health challenges cannot say that it is truly well with him or her. I declare in the mighty name of Jesus that from today onward, you will begin to live insound health.<br>The story in our Bible reading for today reveals the healing power of our Lord Jesus Christ and also shows that sin can be a source for sickness. This is the reason theHoly Spirit through the writer of Acts 10:38 said:<br><strong><em>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</em></strong><br>For you to live a sickness-free life in this new year, you must desist from any sin that might exist in your life. Confess them to God, ask for His forgiveness, andgenuinely repent from them. If you do not genuinely repent of any sin that exists in your life, you are setting yourself up for great torment by the devil, as Jesus told the sick fellow in our memory verse for today.<br>Jesus gave a parable about putting new wine into old wine bottles in Luke 5:36-38. You cannot receive a miracle from God and remain in a sinful state; it is like putting new wine in an old wine bottle. As Jesus warned in His parable, such a person will surely be destroyed.<br>In our Bible reading today, Jesus pronounced healing on the sick fellow and, after a while, upon seeing him again, gave him a warning that he should not commit sin again. A lesson here for us to learn is that it is not enough for a fellow to receive his or her healing or any other miracle and go about committing sin afterwards. Such a fellowwill definitely lose the healing or miracle. As I have pronounced healing and sound health upon you today, may the Lord keep you away from sin so that you will not lose your miracles to it, in Jesus' name.",

Unfortunately, many people still live in poverty becausethey have not surrendered all to God, Who is the only source of true prosperity that has no sorrow in it (Proverbs 10:22).<br>The Bible makes us understand that man became poor as a result of sin:<br><strong><em>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,</em></strong><strong><em>saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread...</em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Genesis 3:17-19</strong><br>Thankfully, Jesus Christ came to redeem mankind from sin and all its consequences, including poverty. The Bible says that Jesus became poor so that we may, through His poverty, become rich (2 Corinthians 8:9). When a person surrenders his or her life to Jesus Christ, He will redeem that fellowfrom poverty and make him or her a partaker of the immeasurable riches of the Most High God.<br>My God is Jehovah Jireh (Genesis 22:13-14), meaning He is the Lord that provides. He is also El-Shaddai (Genesis 17:1, 35:11), meaning, He is the Almighty and All-sufficient One. He has immeasurable riches in His treasury. He declared that silver is His and gold belongs to Him (Haggai 2:8). He also said, <strong><em>“For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.”</em></strong> (Psalms 50:10). God's original intention was for man to partake of and control His immeasurable riches, especially on the earth (Genesis 1:26-30).<br>Beloved, if you are not truly born again, surrender your life to Christ now, and He will become your provider.

However, when Jesus intervened, the young man was instantlyhealed. Surprisingly, some Bible translations have tried to downplay the importance of fasting and praying in the life of a Christian by deliberately omitting verse 21 from the 17th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The word of God is settled forever in heaven (Psalms 119:89). Our Lord Himself did not only pray; he also fasted a great deal (Luke 4:1-2).<br>Beloved, as you pass through this new year, add fasting to righteous living, prayers and praises to the Almighty God. You will experience His abundant goodness, and it shall be well with you. Experience has convinced methat fasting does not kill; it can only make you physically and, more importantly, spiritually stronger. My life is a testimony; I will be 82 years old in a couple of months by the grace of God, and I still fast regularly! I am stronger than many young people who eat three square mealswith snacks in-between!<br>As a young Christian, I did not start with marathon fasting, so if you are not used to the spiritual exercise of fasting, you can start by skipping your breakfast and praying instead. You can then move to skipping bothbreakfast and lunch. Before long, you will graduate to fasting for 24 hours, and then you will graduate to engaging in marathon fasts for days like Jesus Christ, who fasted for forty days and forty nights.<br>Lastly, I should mention that when you are fasting, you are bound to be hungry. You will need a lot of self-discipline to ensure that you do not break your fasts prematurely. May God grant you the grace to fast and pray, and it shall indeed be well with you all through this year and beyond, in Jesus' name.",

Our memory verse for today affirms this as well.Beloved, I encourage you to live righteously in this new year if you want it to be well with you, your family, your business, your finances, and everything that concerns you. <br>One question you might, however, be asking yourself is, “How can one be righteous in this perverse generation when the Bible says in Romans 3:23 that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God?” The answer to thisquestion is very simple; the Bible tells us in 1 John 1:9 that if we confess our sins, God will forgive us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, will cleanse us from all sin. Isaiah 64:6 also says:<br><strong><em>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</em></strong><br>The above scriptures establish the truth that we cannot cleanse ourselves and become acceptable to God by our own efforts; only the righteousness of God, which is obtainable through Jesus Christ, who died for our sins, is acceptable to God (Philippians 3:3-9).<br>Truly, many forecasts have projected that the year may be challenging, but I assure you that those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under His shadow (Psalms 91:1), and they will be shielded from anyevil that may be lurking ahead. The Bible, however, clearly says that God cannot behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). This implies that you must have the righteousness of God through Christ if you want to access the secret place of the Most High.<br>As you surrender your life to Jesus and walk in His righteousness all through this year and beyond, I decree once again that all shall be well with you.",

      "Over the past six days, we have been studying some resolutions I made for this year, and I have been encouraging all users of this devotional to adopt them as well. I have said that in my walk with God this year, I will worship Him, ask for His help, humble myself, give to Him, trust Him and draw close to Him more than ever before. However, all these would be impossible to achieve if I do not make up my mind to live holy more than ever before. This year, I am determined never to do anything that will offend God. I will live holy more than ever before!<br>Amos 3:3 says: <strong><em>“Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” </em></strong>Please check how you have been living in the past years, do you think God will be happy to come close to you knowing fully well that His eyes cannot beholdiniquity (Habakkuk 1:13)?<br>If you really want to get close to God, and you want Him to solve all your problems this year, then you must repent of all your sins and forsake them. Don't continue to live in sin and expect God's help. Shall we continue in sin and expect God's grace to abound? Apostle Paul's response to that question was, “God forbid!” (Romans 6:1-2). Grace is God's help, and it cannot abound upon a sinner.<br>All your seeds, worship, prayers, and so on that you have decided to do this year will be wasted if you do not live a holy life. In other words, if you do not want all your efforts to live by these resolutions this year to be fruitless, you must live holy. God does not hear the prayer of sinners (Psalms 66:18), neither does He accept their sacrifices (Isaiah 59:1-2).<br>Beloved, for all the resolutions we studied over the past six days to produce the desired result, you must be deliberate about living holy more than ever before this year and beyond. This year, I will not only love righteousness more, but will also hate iniquity more. That way, God will anoint me even much more than ever before (Hebrews 1:9).<br>The Almighty God will grant you all-round success as you make up your mind to live holy and also adopt all the other resolutions we discussed over the past six days, in Jesus' name.",

      "My sixth resolution is to walk more closely with God than ever before this year. The Bible says in James 4:8 that if you draw near to God, He will draw near to you. Our God is not a touch-and-go God; He is a God who wants you to abide in Him (John 15:4-7).<br>Some of us are Sunday-Sunday Christians; we go to church only on Sundays, and it is only then that we read our Bibles and pray. The Almighty God wants you to be close to Him, to draw nearer to Him each day. This year, like never before, I am going to draw close to God and ensure He is by my side daily. I have discovered from experience that there are problems you can solve with your efforts in a year, two years or even ten years, but if you draw near to God, He can solve them in minutes!<br>I studied for my PhD at the University of Lagos. To get a PhD in Mathematics, you must solve a problem nobody has solved before. Being a problem nobody has solved before, nobody knows whether it has a solution, and they don't give you a PhD for trying but for solving the problem. So, I began to work out the details of the problem I chose, and eventually, I ended up with 186 simultaneous equations! I had been working on the problem for 18 months and didn't know what to do next. One night, after struggling with the equations till around 10pm, I decided to go and sleep. I, however, decided to study the Bible before going to bed, and I studied Exodus 14:21-28 – the crossing of the Red Sea, and God suddenly spoke to me. He said, “Son, go and bring your mathematics problems.” He began to guide me step by step to put the equations into two different groups – one on the right and the other on the left. Suddenly, I saw something I had not seen before. All the equations on the right had something in common, and all the ones on the left had another thing in common. Then the Lord spoke to me, “Solve the ones on the left together, the ones on the right together, and then bring the two together.” In five hours, I finished the problem I had been tackling for18 months!<br>Whatever problem you might be facing, draw near to God this year, and He will give you a solution, in Jesus' name.",

      "My fifth resolution is that this year, I am going to be very deliberate about putting all my trust in God, and none in man. I will do so because God said, “Vain is the help of man” (Psalms 60:11). You may have discovered that several of the people you thought will help you have let you down, but there is a God who never fails, and He will not fail you this year.<br>I went to my village in the 1980s after I had just become the General Overseer of the RCCG, and someone said to me, “Now that you are the General Overseer, you will need a befitting house to host dignitaries that may have cause to visit you here, especially when you have one ceremony or theother”. I agreed with him, and he said he would help me to build the house. He told me that he produces blocks, so he will supply me with all the blocks I'll need to build the house, and I can pay him for them whenever I can afford to. I believed God was behind it all, and I was very happy.<br>Beloved, when somebody offers you help, check first with God to be sure it's from Him. I built the house, and the very day I roofed it, he asked me to pay for all the blocks he had supplied. I was shocked. This man had said that I could pay anytime I had the money. I had just roofed the house and hadn't even put doors or windows! Deep within me, I was sorrowful. I said toGod, “Lord, you know I have never done anything that I cannot handle; it was this man who lured me into this. Please have mercy on me, don't let me be put to shame.” I prayed all night and fell asleep at my desk. When I woke up, there was a man standing at my doorstep. He said he came all the way from the north, and that God told him to give me an envelope. I collected the envelope, prayed for him, and he left. After he left, I opened the envelope; it was the exact amount that I was owing!<br>There is a God who is the ever-present help in times of trouble.

If you sow sparingly, you will reap sparingly, and if you sow bountifully, you will reap bountifully (2 Corinthians 9:6).<br>This year, like never before, I am going to give because I know that when I give, there will be a harvest. I will give cheerfully because God loves a cheerful giver (2 Corinthians 9:7), and I need His favour. If you are expecting a big harvest this year, make up your mind to sow bountifully.<br>I remember a time when we were preparing for our annual convention, and I needed N17,000 to install roofing sheets on the first auditorium we erected inRedemption City. I had only N1,000 and was praying to God for the remaining N16,000 when one of my pastors came into my office to ask for N1,000. He needed the money to roof the shed he was building to accommodate members under his jurisdiction during the convention. I told him I also needed money and sent him out of my office. As he was leaving, God spoke to me and said, “Call him back and give him that N1,000.” I grumbled because it was difficult, but I obeyed all the same. After the pastorhad left joyfully with my N1,000 in his pocket, God said, “Son, why are you grumbling? There were two problems; I used you to solve one. The one you cannot solve, leave it to me.” Some hours later, someone came all the way from Port Harcourt and said, “Sir, I have just collected rent from my tenants, and the Almighty God said I should bring it to you.” He gave me an envelope, and I blessed him.

      "This year, I have decided that I will humble myself more than ever before. I will ask anyone who can assist me for help, irrespective of their status. Many people do not have a problem with asking for help from someone who is 'superior' to them, but a lot find it difficult to seek for help from people theyconsider to be beneath them. This sort of attitude robs many people of their blessings.<br>When I was in secondary school, I was good at Mathematics and other subjects, but I knew that I needed extra coaching to pass the English Language. In those days, it didn't matter how brilliant you were; if you passed all other subjects and failed the English Language, you'd be considered a failure. I asked a junior of mine who was born in England and had a verygood command of English Language to teach me, and I got an A! He can boast today that he taught me, but it wouldn't matter because I already have my certificate. This year, don't let pride hold you back from the help you can get to fulfil your destiny.<br>Unfortunately, however, many proud people don't know that they are proud. Some of them even boast about their pride and give it fancy names like self-esteem, self-confidence and so on. Beloved, any level of self-esteem that makes people afraid to approach you is pride. Someone may know the solution to your problem, but because of how you carry yourself as ifyou own the world, he or she may not approach you with the solution. You need to humble yourself, smile more, speak warmly to people, and make it easy for them to speak to you.<br>In our Bible reading for today, we can learn a lot from Naaman and his wife. First, his wife was approachable, and the maid was able to talk to her about her husband's embarrassing problem. Also, when Naaman got to Elisha's place and got angry that Elisha did not come out to pray for him, it was one of his servants who advised him, and he heeded the advice. The cure toNaaman's leprosy was tied to people that were considered inferior to him; thank God he was humble enough to listen to them.<br>This year, make it your resolution to humble yourself more than ever before. Remember, God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6).",

This year, I will open my mouth and tell God exactly how things are with me. I have discovered from experience that many people have become so good at pretending that all is well when all is not, even before God, the One whoknows everything.<br>In our Bible reading today, the men of Jericho revealed the true state of their city to Elisha and God used the prophet to put an end to the problem in their land. Come to think of it however, Elijah, the spiritual father of Elisha, walked among the people of Jericho for years, but it was not recorded in the Bible that they informed him of the problems they were facing. They suffered for so long because of their silence! This year, I have decided that I am not going to suffer in silence. I am going to tell the Almighty God what my problems are; I am going to tell Him everything because I know that He will solve them all. I will not wait until I am about to lose things that are precious to me before I cryout like the widow in 2 Kings 4:1-7 did.<br>I visited one of my uncles many years ago and his wife served me pounded yam about the size of a baby's fist. If I had intended to stay for one day, I would have kept my mouth shut, but I was going to stay for one week and pounded yam of that size will not satisfy me at all. I was very young, and I had a healthy appetite. So, I called the woman, “Excuse me ma'am, am I welcome here?” She said, “Yes, of course you are.” I said, “In that case, this pounded yam cannot satisfy me; please let me have some more.” She went into her bedroom, and I did not know what she told her husband, but I heard them laughing. I couldn't have cared less; as long as she came back with more pounded yam, I was fine.<br>This year, ensure that you do not pretend or form as the youths will say, before God. Tell Him exactly where the shoe hurts. Make up your mind like me to ask for His help more than ever before and He will surely answer you (Matthew 21:22).",

One had favour, the other exerted labour. The moment he said that, I made up my mind that I am going to enjoy God's favour in every area of my life.

Please do not treat them like the typical New Year resolutions that are often quickly forgotten in the course of the year.<br>This year, like never before, I am determined to praise and worship God with all my heart and strength.

I will worship and praise God so much that He will volunteer to help me like He did for Paul and Silas in Acts 16: 25-26.<br>My biological father was so poor that whenever the time came for school fees to be paid, he will pick quarrels with his two wives so that they wouldn't be able to ask for thechildren's school fees.

Like David who also enjoyed divine favour all through his life, I will bless God at all times and His praise shall continually be in my mouth (Psalms 34:1). I will never stop praising His holy name.

Proverbs 15:27 says the one who is greedy of gain troubleth his own house. You create a problem for your family when you are greedy. Children can get into trouble because their parents have been greedy.<br><br>Several years ago when we were starting a parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Zambia, a native who was supposed to be our representative was collecting money for the purpose of building the Church and diverting it to His private use. One day, his daughter was playing with their door – a little one installed to stop goats from gaining entrance into the house while fresh air and illumination can come in from the top. Suddenly the door broke off and a loose nail from it pierced the girl’s eye and plucked it out. I prayed for the child, reminding the Lord of her father’s service in the Church. The Lord said I should ask him certain things. I did, further telling him about what God would do if he lied. With his head down, trembling, he said “I have not been faithful. I have been misappropriating the money sent to me to build the church”.<br><br>Those who are greedy may show off their ill-gotten wealth and parade themselves as smart, but as the word of God stands sure, their real pain is on its way. Some are already going through their own pain and are hiding it from the whole world. Don’t get tempted to become like them because you don’t know the sufferings they are hiding in the background.<br><br>Greed is an invitation to take unlawfully what is not yours. The interesting thing is, that thing you are greedily desiring can be yours if only you will patiently go through the right process. Those who allow greed to override contentment in their lives will eventually lose what they have. The devil was an archangel but lost it all because he was greedy for what could never be his. A greedy fellow has no gratitude for God's blessings in his or her life and believes in snatching what belongs to others. <br><br>Think about all God has done for you this year and express your gratitude to Him so he can do more for you in 2024",

Fear not. Before Goliath started terrorising Israel, the stone that would kill him had been formed, waiting for when David would pick it up, put it in his catapult and shoot it at the giant. Before the Philistines came for Samson, the jaw bone of the ass was already there, waiting. Before 2024 arrives, the things you will need to overcome in the new year are already available to you. The tree that will turn bitter water to sweet had been there before the Israelites got to Marah; all that happened when Moses cried unto God is that light shone on a particular tree and God told Moses what should be done with it.<br><br>Isaiah 30:21 says that when you find yourself at a crossroads, you would hear a word behind you, showing you the way. I pray that the way by which you will walk successfully through 2024 will be revealed to you today, in Jesus’ name.

Whether you believe that is possible or not, I decree that in the new year coming, you will be telling God “Lord, these blessings are too many”. That is your portion, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Many years ago, God asked me to sacrifice my first car and I did. After some time, somebody bought me a Mercedes Benz car. In those days, everybody believed that if you are a child of God, you were to remain poor, so I locked it up in the garage. After some time, God visited me in the night and said, “Son, why are you delaying the blessings of my daughter who gave you the car? You had better use it now, because a bigger one is coming”.<br><br>At 3 a.m. one morning, a man came and said “I couldn’t sleep; God said I should give you my car”. I came out to see the car and it was this long limousine with six doors. I laughed! After the man had left, I said to God, “Daddy, you know that even if I am dead and they put me inside this one, I will jump out of it, so there is no way I can use this. Will you please allow me to sell it and use the money for something else?” He said “No problem”.<br><br>However, God was not done. In a single day, a man came with three Mercedes Benz cars. He said, “God said I should give these to you”. I said “God what is happening? What am I going to do? These blessings are becoming an embarrassment”. The Lord then said to me “My son, you haven’t seen anything yet. The only way I can stop blessing you is if you stop living holy”. Now, since I cannot stop living holy because I am going to heaven, those who think I am already blessed haven’t seen anything yet; there is more coming by God’s grace.<br><br>You don’t know what you miss when you refuse to live holy. I advise you to try it for at least six months and you would see how things will change for you completely.

      "A blessing is a manifestation of all the forces in heaven, on earth and under the earth helping someone. When God blesses someone, everything – family, career, finance and so on will be working well for that fellow. If you really want God to bless you, you need to know how to attract His blessings. Psalms 115:3 says God is sovereign, He does as He pleases. He can bless anybody He wants; He can bless the younger more than the elder, He is God.<br><br>In Deuteronomy 28:2 the word of God made it clear: <i>“And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God”.</i><br><br>Deuteronomy 11:26-28 says further: <br><br><b>Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.</b><br><br>The choice you make between living holy and committing sin determines what you attract to your life - whether blessings or curses. If you live holy, you would attract God’s blessings, if you choose to live in sin, you would attract curses. Which one will you choose?<br><br>Blessings don’t come without a cause. In Genesis 27:1-4, Isaac told Esau to go and prepare a very nice meal that would satisfy him, so that he could bless the boy before dying. Though it was Esau that was to be blessed, Jacob who brought the meal first, got the blessing. He provoked the blessing upon himself by doing something to please his father. If you want God to bless you, please Him. The only way to do this is to live a life of holiness. If you refuse to live holy, forget about attracting the blessings of God.<br><br>Don’t mistake money for blessings. A truly blessed man has peace all round.",

Daniel was later given the same task and he said “Give me some time; I have a God who can reveal the deepest knowledge that no one else has ever accessed.” He got home, called his friends and they began to pray, then that night, God revealed the king’s dream and the interpretation, to him.

In God’s banking system, all you need is a relationship with Him - the Owner and you can get permission to withdraw from His bank. For some, He could give unlimited access to withdrawals, for some, He could give as much as they can carry per time, while for yet another set, He would just let them withdraw what they need per time. I don’t know about you, but I want Him to give me unlimited access to withdraw from His bank.<br><br>In 1 Kings 17:8-16, there is the case of a widow who gave her last meal to the prophet of God and from that day on, for over three years, there was abundant supply of food in her house every single day. That was unlimited withdrawal. In 2 Kings 4:1-7, there was another widow who was in serious need. The Lord granted her access to withdraw oil from His bank and as soon as she had filled all the vessels she could had, the supply of oil stopped. That was withdrawal according to her capacity. In Matthew 17:24-27, when some people asked Peter for Jesus’ tax, the Lord told Peter to go fishing and pick money for their taxes from the mouth of the first fish he would catch. That was a case of withdrawal according to the need at hand. <br><br>My Father-in-the-Lord - Pa Josiah Akindayomi, the founder of the Redeemed Christian Church of God told how, one day, he cried to God for provision of food and the Lord said “Tell your wife that from that pot of soup, she should just go on dishing every day, but she must not look inside”. He told his wife what the Lord had said and from that day, there was unlimited supply of all kinds of soup from the pot, until the day she was overcome by curiosity.

However, if you are still committing sin and feeling it is okay to do so, sorry, you have no place in heaven. The place He is preparing in Heaven is only for those living Holy and are without blemish, spot or wrinkle.He is coming back only for this people as they will be presented to himself as His bride. Ephesians 5:27. <br><br>It is interesting to know however, that Jesus may be preparing a mansion with the name of someone on it, but that fellow may eventually not stay in that mansion while someone else takes his or her place. That is why Revelation 3:11 says <i>“Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.”</i> <br><br>In the days when it was considered a crime in a certain country to believe in Jesus Christ, some soldiers five young Christians. In the peak of terribly cold weather, the soldiers stripped these five boys and sent them into a freezing lake. The soldiers built a fire to keep themselves warm and said to these boys, “All you need to do to come to this warm fire and have your clothes on is to deny Jesus Christ”. After a little while, the boys began to freeze in the water. When they were about to freeze to death, one of the boys raised his hand and told the soldiers he was no longer a Christian. They told him to come to the fire. As he started moving towards the fire, God opened the eyes of one of the soldiers and he saw five angels, each one carrying a crown, just waiting for these boys to breathe their last so they could crown them and welcome them home. As the boy who denied Jesus began to walk out of the lake, his angel turned to go away with his crown. The soldier cried “Angel, wait for me, I will take the crown”. He removed his clothes, jumped into the lake, died with the other four and took the crown of that young man.<br><br>Starting a race is of little consequence; what really matters is if you reach the finish line.",

      "Further into my study of how to become God’s favourite, I found that there was another disciple who also followed Jesus on the day He was crucified. It was this disciple that helped Peter access the courtyard as we see in John 18:15-16. This other disciple apparently was John the beloved as he referred to himself in the third person all through his account of the gospel. When you read John 19:26-27, you will find that it was John who took the mother of Jesus into his own house. Anyone who look after your mother must be very close to you. <br><br>I’ve always said that when you describe somebody as a Christian fanatic, it simply means he loves the Lord more than you. In John 20:1-8, the Bible tells us that when they brought news to the Apostles that Jesus was risen, John was the first Apostle to get to the tomb. In John 13:21-26 when the disciples sought to know who would betray the Lord, Peter beckoned to John and told him to ask Jesus, because he knew that John. Even Peter knew that John was the closest to him. Thirteen people were at the table and two of them were speaking in codes the others could not understand. John was so close to Jesus that he could rest his head on His chest(John 13:23). <br><br>In our Bible reading for today, we see that it is only John that Jesus trusted with the identity of who would betray Him. Jesus trusted John with His secrets. When God can trust you with His secrets, you become extremely close to Him. Jesus made John His confidant, that is why you find that in Revelation 1:1-20, it was John the Beloved whom Jesus chose to give the story of what will happen in the end times, Thousands of years ahead of his time. In Revelation 10:4, there are things Jesus revealed to John that He said were for his ears only.<br><br>When you truly love God, you become willing to seek and fulfill his primary heart desire which is to bring souls into His Kingdom.",

      "In my study of what it takes to become a favourite of God, I saw in Luke 5:1-11, where the Bible tells us that after Jesus paid Peter a visit and performed that miracle of a boat-sinking catch, Peter left all and followed Him. He didn’t sell the fish he caught that day. However, all the other disciples also left everything they had and followed Him (Matthew 19:27), so there must be something extra about Peter, and I saw a little bit of it in Mark 14:54 when Jesus was to be arrested and the disciples, fled. The Bible says Peter followed after the Lord. I know that people always like to underline the fact that he followed afar off, but at least he followed. Where were the others?<br><br>Peter always followed Jesus because there was a rope permanently tied to Him and the Lord –the rope of love. The love Peter had for Jesus was like a magnet drawing him closer to the Lord daily.<br><br>As soon as Peter recognised the Lord after His resurrection, he jumped into the sea to go and meet Jesus. He abandoned the great catch of fish that he had just gotten - again. Clearly, this shows that Peter was very much interested in the Lord, not what the Lord could give. He was interested in the Lord Himself. Those who become God’s favourites are people who are not after what God can give them but after God Himself. They just love God with all their hearts - whether He gives them anything or not. It is this selfless love that made God choose Peter as His spokesman.<br><br>In Acts 2:14-40, on the day of Pentecost, who preached? Peter. In Acts 3:1-8 at the Beautiful Gate, who spoke to the lame man? Peter. When God wanted to uproot Ananias and Sapphira - the first pretenders in the Church, it was Peter who pronounced their death. The Lord will not make you His favourite when He sees that your belly is actually your god and not Him (Philippians 3:19). Some people want to be able to command the devil, but he mocks them because he knows that they love the things of the world, so they are under his control, not the other way around.",

These three were the favourites of Jesus Christ and He took them with Him everywhere He went. When He was going to Jairus’ house, He had all the twelve disciples with Him, but it was only those three who He took with Him (Mark 5:35-42). Peter, James and John saw His power; they saw Him raise the little girl from death while the others only heard about it.<br><br>Why did the Lord have a special inner circle amongst His disciples and why did He love one of them specially? Well, the simple answer is that God has favourites.<br><br>Many people say that God has no favorites. This is not true. The question you should be asking therefore is “How do I become one of His favourites?” When you read Romans 9:11-16, the Bible says a woman was pregnant with a set of twins. Before they were born, God said the elder would serve the younger, that He loved one and hated the other even, when they were not yet born. He said He would have mercy on whom He will have mercy and compassion on whom He would have compassion. He said it is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of the Lord who hat showeth mercy.<br><br>In Acts 10:34-35, the Bible says:<br><br><b>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</b><br><br>This passage makes me see clearly that God looks out for certain things in people before He makes them His favourites.

When you are famous, you cannot even take a stroll outside or play in a public place like every other person.<br><br>One of the dangers of being famous is that people tend to forget that famous people are human beings too. I thank God that I have never been after fame so I show regularly that I am as human as anybody can be. I still occasionally buy roasted plantain on the roadside.

They worry about if all they have disappears because Proverbs 23:5 says riches can develop wings and fly away. The Almighty God says “Don’t worry at all” because He is the All-Sufficient God (Genesis 17:1). The One who gave you what you have now has much more in store for you. Philippians 4:19 says you should not worry because He will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory. Do you know how rich He is in glory? Isaiah 6:3 says the whole earth is full of His glory. He is extremely rich in glory and since He has promised to supply your needs according to His riches in glory, then you know that supply will never run dry. Proverbs 10:22 says: <i>“The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.”</i><br><br>If your riches are from God, then you have absolutely nothing to worry about; otherwise, understand that money gotten in sin comes with plenty of sorrows.<br><br>You can be very rich and have many servants, but if they know you are very old, you can call them and they won’t answer.

In Psalms 37:25, David said, <i>“I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.”</i>. The same David told us in Psalms 34:10, <i>“The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.”</i> He concluded Psalms 23 by saying that there is only one thing for you to look forward to if you are on the side of the Lord and that is goodness and mercy all the days of your life (verses 5 and 6).

      "In our memory verse for today, the words “Let not your heart be troubled” simply mean “Don’t worry”. Whenever the Bible says “Don’t worry” it means there is something that could cause a person some anxiety. Whenever you hear God say “Fear not” it means there is something frightening around. The Bible says in Matthew 6:31 that you should not worry because that is what the heathens do. If you really have faith in God, if you really believe He loves you, then you should not worry about anything. The God that feeds the birds in the air is capable of feeding you too. The God that clothes the lilies in the field so beautifully will clothe you too. If you are sure that He is your Father indeed, then you have no reason to worry. The son of a billionaire is never worried about what to eat or what to wear. Your Father is not just a billionaire- all the gold and silver in the world is His (Haggai 2:8). He promised in John 14:14 that if you ask for anything in His name, He will give it to you; anything means ANYTHING.<br><br>While He has promised to give us whatever we ask of Him, we must however, not be lazy. I have discovered that many Christians are lazy. There are jobs I have given to Christians to do and they charge much higher than the normal fee, yet didn’t deliver on time and did the work shabbily, A similar job given to an unbeliever would not only cost less but would be thoroughly done and delivered within the agreed timeframe. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says God does not support laziness and anyone who is lazy should not eat. Anyone who calls himself or herself a Christian and is lazy is not a child of God, and so the Lord is not under any obligation to provide for him or her.<br><br>There are many people who sit around all day saying they haven’t found a job, that is why they are not working. What a lazy attitude! Get up and find something productive to do with your time. Look within you; there must be one skill you have that you can use to meet other people's needs. if you remain focus and continue to improve yourself, you will definitely begin to some income from it sooner or later. Years ago, there was a man who didn't find a job so he started frying akara (bean cakes) by the road and within months, had bought two motorcylcles and was earning income from them.

When a sermon is going on, the Holy Spirit is likely to whisper some things into your ears; they could be prophecies or instructions. You need to write those things down so that you don’t forget. Also, as the preacher is speaking, to help you practice what is being preached, you may need to write down one or two actions you will take in line with the sermon. You need to also write down aspects of the sermon or passages of the Bible that you would like to conduct deeper study on.<br><br>You must understand that these notes are treasures from which you and others coming after you can gain from. At the Open Heavens International Centre, there are some of my old sermon notes from over 30 years ago; they are treasures for many who visit the gallery to draw lessons from.<br><br>In Revelation 1:19, God told John to write the things he was seeing down as a treasure for us today to know what is to come in the end time. We also saw similar instances from our memory verse and Bible reading today. Beloved, you should take notes whenever you are listening to or studying the Word of God.",

      "Over the past two days we have discussed condition and covection as methods of transferring anointing. Toda, we will discuss a third method called 'radiation'. Radiation in this context refers to when the anointing is transferred through the air without any form of physical contact. This is the highest form of transferring of anointing.<br><br>We see the transfer of anointing by radiation in Acts 5:12-16 where Peter did not touch the sick at all; they were only laid on the floor and his shadow healed them. Anointing can be transferred from the preacher on the altar to someone sitting in the congregation or even through a television set, radio, phone and so on.<br><br>With the millions of people who attend our programmes in the Redemptiom Camp, it is impractical to lay hands on everyone, so God increased His anointing upon me and made it possible for me to just wave my hands from the altar and even people at the back of the auditorium would be healed. As the crowd grew even more, God increased the anointing so that it could be transferred through a combination of both radiation and conduction. Now when I wave my hands and pray on people’s handkerchiefs, those handkerchiefs become anointed and the Lord works miracles through them.<br><br>There was a fellow who came to one of our programmes during which, as led by the Lord, I said “Whatever garment you are wearing today is anointed”. The following week, the man was going to work in his car and there was a crowd blocking his way, so he parked to find out what happened. He saw that a vehicle had knocked someone down and the fellow was dead. He suddenly remembered that the jacket he was wearing was the one he wore on the Holy Ghost night, so he pushed the people aside, took his jacket, laid it on the dead man and the fellow got up. Anointing was transferred to the cloth by radiation, then the cloth transferred the anointing to the dead fellow by conduction.",

      "Another way by which the anointing can be transferred from an anointed person to someone who needs it is by convection. Just think of how car batteries are charged. Dead batteries absorb enough power to supply electricity to your car. In the same way, an anointed man or woman can pray on a handkerchief or oil, send it to the place where the anointing is needed, and miracles would begin to happen through that medium. This is because it has become charged with anointing. In our Bible reading today, we see a very good example of transfer of the anointing by convection. Handkerchiefs or aprons that had contacted anointing from the body of Paul were used to heal many sick people and to drive out evil spirits.<br><br>I remember the first time I transferred anointing by convection. I had just returned from a journey overseas and was tired. One of my daughters came to me asking that I come and pray for her grandmother, who had just been operated on, but because of old age, the wound refused to heal. I was too tired to go with her to the hospital, so I prayed on a handkerchief and gave it to her to lay it on her grandmother. She did as I said and by the following day, not only was the grandmother healed, the doctors could not even find the scar from the surgery. The handkerchief transferred the power of healing. You must note, however that this is a higher form of transfer of anointing than conduction.<br><br>If you have just been newly anointed, you may need to spend quality time praying on the medium through which you want to transfer the anointing. As you grow in the anointing, you would get to the point where you can just pray a simple prayer on the medium and it would become anointed. You can reach the point where the medium becomes charged just by touching it. In Acts 19:11-12, the Bible did not say that Apostle Paul prayed on the handkerchiefs and aprons; he only touched them while using them and they became charged, but that was when he had gotten to the point where God was doing special miracles by his hands.",

      "Anointing, just like electricity, obeys certain natural laws and can be transferred by way of conduction.<br><br>Transfer of anointing by conduction is when the anointed fellow has physical contact with the person who needs the anointing. This can be through a handshake or laying on of hands. For example, in Acts 3:1-8, the lame man at the Beautiful Gate didn’t walk until Peter grabbed him. The anointing flowed through Peter’s hands into the lame man. Jesus Christ said in Mark 16:18: <i>“They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover”.</i> Jesus was saying that when we lay hands on the sick, the anointing in us will be transferred to them and the sickness will be gone. Sometimes, it may even be unintentional. For instance, the moment you step on a naked wire, knowingly or unknowingly, the electricity running through it will run through you too. Similarly sometimes, anointing can be transferred by conduction without both parties even trying to initiate the transfer. For example, in 2 Kings 13:20-21, when the dead man’s body accidentally fell into the grave of Elisha, the fellow came back to life.<br><br>A few years ago, I was abroad and decided to go shopping in a bookshop. A man came into the bookshop and made a joke about the large number of books I was buying. He stretched his hand to shake me and I shook his hand without trying to transfer anointing to him. Suddenly he shouted, “Who are you?” because the back pain he had been suffering from for many years suddenly disappeared as I shook his hand. That is transfer of anointing by conduction. Beloved, whenever you have the opportunity to shake hands with an anointed fellow or have them lay hands on you, don’t take it for granted. Your life can change just by that simple contact. This is not to say you should go around trying to touch every man or woman of God you see by force; be respectful and decent about it because the same anointing that heals can kill also, if grieved.",

If you want power from God Almighty, you must be ready to conquer your flesh. When you are ruled by the Spirit, not the flesh, then God can trust you with power. If you can get addicted to fasting, prayer, studying the Bible and holiness, then you are a candidate that God can consider for the possession of divine power. When I talk about holiness and living above sin as one of my major secrets of power, some people think I am only being legalistic, but when you read Hebrews 1:9, you will see that you must love righteousness and hate iniquity for God to anoint you.<br><br>Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:27 that he put his body under subjection. He said also that he fasted often (2 Corinthians 11:27). What was the result of all these? Acts 19:11-12 says that when demons saw his handkerchiefs, they ran; that is power. When I am fasting and emphasising holiness everyday, I know what I am doing. I am seeing the results in my life so I will not stop. Several years ago, the Full Gospel Businessmen’s Fellowship International invited me to preach on ‘The New Anointing’. By the time I had finished speaking, I had to sneak away into the car because everybody wanted to touch me. There was a man running after me with a handkerchief in his hand.

When man promotes, it is temporary; only God gives real promotion that no one can interfere with.<br><br>Since we know now that the only way to really make progress in life is to be promoted by God, then we need to find out His criteria for promotion. God promoted David from being a shepherd boy to becoming the king of Israel for one simple reason – David was sold out to the will of God (Acts 13:22). David was not a man to argue with God. With David, God’s wish was his command. The reason God gave Jesus a name that is above every other is what He said in John 4:34: <i>“…My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work”.</i><br><br>In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus wished the cup of suffering for the sins of the world could be taken away from Him, but He said to God,<i>“Not my will but yours be done”</i> (Luke 22:42). When Jesus was teaching His disciples to pray, one of the prayer points He mentioned was:<i> “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”</i> (Matthew 6:10).<br><br>God wants His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Therefore, when He sees someone willing to do His will, He promotes that fellow to a position of authority. If God promotes somebody because the fellow started in humility and submission to Him, but along the line begins to disregard His instructions, that fellow would be demoted immediately. That is what happened to Saul in 1 Samuel 15:24-28. Saul started out well, but somewhere in-between, he preferred to please the people over doing God’s will. Some people have been asking God to promote them, but they have no regard for His will. Promotion will only come when you surrender completely to God’s will.",

After he lost everything, he discovered that God has a way of making a fellow humble by fire. God used the fire of affliction to remove pride from his life.<br><br>Some people have asked me why I am always saying ‘Yes, Sir’ and ‘Yes, Ma’am’ to everybody. I wasn’t like that before. I was one of the proudest persons you could ever meet - even though I was poor, but God taught me a lesson that settled the issue of pride in my life forever. When I got born again, one of the greatest blessings I received from God early on was the ability to hear Him. I was also the interpreter for the General Superintendent of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. One day, for whatever reason, one of the Pastors came to me and asked me to interpret for him during his ministration. I felt offended. “Who does this man think he is? Doesn’t he know that I am the General Superintendent’s interpreter?” I interpreted quite all right, but I was very upset. After the Service, as I was going to my car, I heard God say clearly, “So you are now too big to interpret for my servant”. I stopped hearing from Him and everything became silent. As soon as the devil discovered that I was no longer hearing from God, he tormented me. I prayed, wept and fasted, but God was silent all through. Believe me, honestly, it is better not to have heard from God at all than for Him to stop speaking to you. God will not leave you alone, in Jesus’ name. <br><br>The period God stopped talking was a terrible time for me.

The first one is the fire of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Peter was one of the first people called by the Lord Jesus Christ in Mark 3:13-19, but he had one little problem: he was always afraid, and the devil discovered this weakness. That is why, on the day Jesus was arrested, the devil brought three people to test Peter, knowing that he would be too afraid to identify openly with Jesus. Indeed, Peter denied Jesus three times. The devil was happy that he had gotten Peter but thankfully, Jesus had prayed for him so he repented and found his way back to God. Now, if Peter was going to be useful to God, Jesus needed to do something about the fear contaminating his heart, so He purified him by fire. On the day of Pentecost, when the fire fell on all the disciples, Jesus was purifying them to make them useful. Immediately that fire sat on the head of Peter; it consumed the fear in him (Acts 2:1-47). The man who used to be afraid suddenly became very bold. The contamination was removed by the fire of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The Holy Ghost Baptism is a refining fire that takes away impurities in the life of a believer. If you are truly baptised - that is, after sanctification (setting oneself apart for God), then that fire will burn off all impurities in you. Note that a person may speak in tongues, but if he is not yet fully surrendered to Christ, if his heart is still after the things of this world, he cannot be purified. Sanctification must happen first before the fellow can truly be purified by the fire of the Holy Ghost.",

      "I would like to give a clear illustration of what we discussed yesterday with the story of Moses. Numbers 12:3 describes Moses as the meekest man on earth, but he had the problem of anger. The devil discovered it in Exodus 2:11-12. Moses saw an Egyptian beating up an Israelite and because he couldn’t control his temper, Moses killed the man. Many years later, while leading the children of Israel to the Promised Land, the devil started hitting on this weak spot. In Exodus 14-15, we see the children of Israel complaining about different things; this was the devil throwing blows at Moses to get him angry but he dodged all of them. However, in Exodus 17:1-7, when there was no water to drink and they turned to Moses to complain again, he said in verse 2, “Why are you chiding with me?” The devil said, “Good, blow number 1 has landed, he is now beginning to respond”. In Exodus 32:15-20, Moses had gone to collect the 10 commandments from God; by the time he returned, the children of Israel were already worshipping an idol. When he came and saw them worshipping the idol, the temper in him rose and he took the two tablets of commandments that God gave him and smashed them. At that point, the devil knew his punches were now landing.<br><br>In Numbers 11:10-15, when the children of Israel were complaining that they wanted meat, Moses turned to God and said, “God, why are you doing this to me? Am I the father of these people?” The devil said, “Good, now I have turned you against your supporter”. By the time we get to Numbers 20:2-13, the people murmured again about water, but this time, instead of speaking to the rock as God commanded, Moses was so angry that he hit it twice. God asked him to speak to the rock, but He decided to strike it. That was disobedience. At that point, the Almighty God said, “Moses, you will not reach the Promised Land”.<br><br>The meek Moses - with only one little contamination called anger, had become, after forty years of ministry, a failure.<br><br>Beloved, kill that little weakness in your life before it kills you.",

The big bucket of clean water becomes contaminated the moment faeces drops into it irrespective of the quantity.

When you and some people do something wrong and one of them tells a lie to cover the entire group and you say, “After all I am not the one that lied”, you are partaking in someone else’s sin and that has contaminated you. In Proverbs 1:10, we are advised: <i>“My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.”</i> If sinners entice you to come and be a partaker of their sins, run away.

      "To be double-minded is to be a hypocrite - one minute, you act a certain way and the next, you are someone else. You say something here and something contrary elsewhere. That is double-mindedness and a sign of an impure heart, according to James 4:8: <i>“Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.”</i><br><br>Matthew 5:8 says only the pure in heart will see God, so double-minded people will not make it to heaven. To be pure means to be of a single content. When people talk about pure cotton or pure wool, it means it does not contain any other kind of material. Purity, therefore, implies singleness of mind and purpose. One of the reasons I love dogs is that you can tell when they’re happy or angry. They have no pretense at all. Unfortunately, when it comes to human beings, they can smile at you and yet plan to kill you.<br><br>To be pure means no pretense (James 5:12). That is when your ‘yes’ is ‘yes’, and your ‘no’ means ‘no’. If you stand for something, stand for it all the way. In Luke 9:59-62, Jesus Christ gave us an illustration of this when He said the moment you have placed your hand on the plough, there must be no looking back. In Luke 16:13, He puts it another way: <i>“No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”</i> If you are serving one master today and serving another tomorrow, you are double-minded. Choose who your master is and stand by him or her all the way. If you want to serve God, then don’t serve money, or visit a witch doctor in secret; serve God and God alone. <br><br>As for me, I am serving the Lord Jesus Christ and I am going with only Him all the way. I tell you again brethren, whatever God does not do for you, no one else can do it. Many of us have not been getting full benefits from the Lord Jesus Christ simply because we are double-minded.

That in itself is worrisome. As a parent, why would you allow your children wear things that portray them as people of the world, rather than of God? It is clear that some parents do not regard God highly; they would rather offend Him than discipline their children. I saw a girl dressed indecently one day; I asked her if her parents had been out when she left the house. She said they were at home and, in fact, it was her mother who had bought the dress for her. I said, “How can you walk through the streets like this? Don’t you know that your dress says that you are available and cheap?”.

You cannot enter a private property without an invitation because doing so would amount to trespassing. A wife is not for sale; she is already off the shelf, yet there are wives whose dressing proclaims them as cheap and available. Why would a woman dress in such a way that what belongs to her husband is exposed for the whole world to see? Some women will say they want to look ‘sexy’. Are you public property? The only fellow you should look ‘sexy’ for is your husband - no one else. The problem is that some husbands are so ignorant that they think their wife dressing half naked in public is stylish.

Many people parade themselves as children of God but dress and talk like people of the world (1 John 2:15).

When somebody is mad, he is mad on the inside, but the evidence is seen on the outside.<br><br>Many years ago, when we had just started the Redeemed Christian Bible College, I brought some Americans to teach the students, but they began to teach my people that I was too harsh and legalistic. They said God is only interested in what is inside the heart, not outside. When I heard this, I knew I was in trouble and sought the face of God for wisdom to handle the situation. Thankfully, He inspired me to buy two oranges of the same size and present to the students One was yellow and the other green. I asked them to choose one and they all chose the yellow one. I asked why and they said it would be sweeter than the green one. I asked them how they came to that conclusion as we had not cut it open; they said the outside shows what is inside. The message was passed.<br><br>The Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 that in the last days, there will be many people who will have a form of godliness. You may talk and dress like a Christian, but those things don’t make you one. Christianity is being like Jesus from the inside out. Your heart must yearn to be more and more like Him. You must avoid sin in order to please God. It is when your heart is aligned with Christ that every other thing on the outside begins to fall in place. You must study God’s word daily with the intention of getting to know more and more of Him. Spend quality time with Him in prayers and worship.

The things you do must be in line with the word of God only. If someone says something that is not in line with God’s word, no matter who they are, reject it. This follows that you must know God for yourself and not only through the lens of someone else. Apostle Paul said, “Be ye\xa0followers of\xa0me, even\xa0as\xa0I\xa0also am of\xa0Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1).

It is not something you do collectively; it is personal. You can be a part of a group of friends who fellowship with and hold one another accountable, but who knows what the others are doing in secret in the middle of the night? Who is there in your thoughts to check you when you are conceiving the wrong ideas? Joshua said, “As for me and my house”. The ‘me’ comes before ‘my house’. He didn’t say ‘As for us’. ‘As for me’, I will do the will of God, not ‘as for us’. It is written in Luke 17:34 that two people will be on a bed, one will be taken and the other left behind.

      "To become intimate with God, the major thing you will need to sacrifice is time. The more time you spend with someone, the more you will become like that fellow. God loves it when we spend quality time with Him, so much so that He prefers that you spend more of your time with Him than you do for Him. The difference between spending your time for Him and with Him is in Luke 10:38-42. Martha was spending her time serving Jesus and that is good, but He said Mary had chosen what was needful by sitting at His feet to hear His word. The time you spend doing the work of God is good, but what is more needful is the time you spend at His feet, hearing His word.<br><br>There are many Church workers and pastors who only read and study their Bibles, pray or hear the word of God when they come to Church. You cannot become intimate with God that way. God wants people who love spending quality time with Him, whether in Church or alone, just because they love Him. As dutiful as David was, he just loved to spend time in the presence of God (Psalms 26:8). That is why God said in 1 Samuel 13:14 that David was a man after His heart.<br><br>To become intimate with God, you must never be satisfied with how close you are to Him now. You must constantly remain hungry for His word and His presence. Those who will be intimate with God will never be satisfied with how much of Him they know Him; they will keep studying more, praying more, fasting more, all in a bid to know Him more. Apostle Paul said in Philippians 3:10, <i>“That I may know Him...”.</i> You begin to wonder, with all the revelations and encounters that Apostle Paul had gotten, he was still saying he wanted to know God. Believe me honestly, the day you feel as if you already know enough of God is the day you begin to draw further from Him. You will no longer know the things you thought you knew before. If you stop growing, you start dying. If you decide not to get closer to God, you will start getting closer to the devil. This is a race track you are on, not a highway with bus stops. Once you stop moving, you are taken off the race track.",

      "Parents usually love their children but oftentimes, they would have favourites even among them. They may try not to make it obvious, but they know who their favourite is. In the same way, there are favorites in the family of God. These are people who please God in every way they can. One of the major life ambitions of God’s favourites is to become very intimate with Him.<br><br>Whether you become a favorite of God or not is up to you; it is a matter of what you choose to love or hate. In 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, Paul said that in a race, there are many people running, but only one winner would emerge. The Lord wants you to be the winner. I don’t know about you, but I want to be at the forefront of this race. I used to be a runner when I was a little younger and our coach would always tell us to make sure we came first. To be number one, you must be willing to pay the price (Philippians 3:7-14). The prize you receive at the end of this race is determined by how willing you are to put your body under now.<br><br>When it comes to being intimate with God, it is more about what you do in private than in public. In Genesis 39:1-9, when Joseph was faced with tremendous pressure from his master’s wife to commit adultery, he ran away. He was very committed to honoring God, even in private. By the time you read Genesis 50:15-21, you see that his brothers came to bow before him. Those who want to be intimate with God don’t go after public approval and public image; they simply do what God loves, notwithstanding what the public thinks about it.<br><br>In Daniel 1:3-8, Daniel and his friends decided not to defile themselves with the king’s meat, contrary to public opinion. They must have looked crazy or like fanatics to some people, but they didn’t mind. As long as they were not defiling their bodies and God was happy with them, they were satisfied. In return, God made them the rulers of all the people when the time came. If you are not willing to count as loss those things that should have been gain so that you can win Christ, you are not willing to become intimate with God.",

      "Our relationship with God is strictly on an individual basis, not collective. Your relationship with God is yours alone – between you and Him. Therefore, the word ‘I’ is applicable in your relationship with God; it is ‘I’, not ‘we’. David said in Psalms 34:1, <i>“I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth”.</i> Our relationship with God is personal. Salvation is an individual business.<br><br>Let me make it clear: God has no grandchildren. You are either a child of God or not. Our Bible reading for today says if your father is godly and you are ungodly, your father will live and you will die. God has no grandchildren, only children; so if you have not yet given your life to Jesus and you think that because your parents are born again, then you will go to heaven, you are deceiving yourself (Ezekiel 18:20).<br><br>Furthermore, after you become born again and get to heaven, the work you put into the Kingdom of God will also be tested individually by fire. In Romans 14:12, the Bible says: <i>“So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God”.</i> Every one shall give account of himself or herself to God. When it comes to God assessing you, it is going to be an individual business. In 1 Corinthians 3:13, the Bible says: <i>“Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is”.</i> Our works will be tried separately, not together.<br><br>Remember that where we are going, there is no night there, so there is enough time. The Pastor, General Overseer and everyone else will stand alone with nowhere to hide. Therefore, when someone is discouraging you from doing the work of God now, remember that the fellow will not be there when your work is being tried. When you let someone else’s attitude affect your motives and zeal for God’s work, don’t forget that you will not be able to blame that fellow on the last day because you will be standing alone in front of God to answer for your actions and inactions.",

    bodyText:
      "Every now and then, God commends His children; He tells them that He is pleased with them. When this happens to you, don’t become full of yourself because He is only being gracious. The Bible says that God is perfect and He expects perfection (Matthew 5:48). Ephesians 5:25-27 makes it clear that Jesus Christ is coming back for a bride without blemish or wrinkle. Are you perfect yet? If God says, “Well done, my son, you are doing great”, He is only being gracious. In Job 1:8, He said Job was a perfect and upright man, but then in Job 30:1, Job said things that a just man shouldn’t. When God scored him as just, He was only being gracious to him. In Numbers 12:3, it is written concerning Moses that he was the meekest man on the earth, but he was well known for his violent temper. God’s commendation is only an extension of grace. You must never let it get into your head; if you do, you would soon realise that you were nowhere in the first place. <br><br>The Bible says clearly in Romans 9:15-16:<br><br><b>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</b><br><br>It is not the works and effort you put in that will make you justified. It is true that you must put in the effort; if not, you may not even get a chance at being commended at all, but the effort does not justify you. It is only God’s mercy that justifies you. Never forget that. When God commends a person, the fellow’s efforts will yield greater results than his or her actions. When you start seeing this happening to you, you must remember that it is only because God decided to have mercy on you. Don’t begin to think that you are perfect, because you are not. Rather, thank Him for His mercy. Acknowledge your weakness before Him and even before people. Ascribe all glory to Him and not to your efforts because without Him, you can do nothing (John 15:5).",

    bodyText:
      "Another way by which a person exhibits pride is by comparing their achievements with those of others. Our Bible reading yesterday (1 Kings 19:13 – 18) showed us that God asked Elijah to anoint his replacements. There is a big lesson to be learnt there. You must never have a ‘holier than thou attitude’ or feel you are doing better than others. You may be more talented or hardworking; however, you must remain humble at all times. The point at which you become proud is where your rising stops. King Saul is another example of this (1 Samuel 15:25-30).<br><br>Our Bible reading today tells us clearly that our humility is required before God promotes us. In other words, once you become proud, you become too heavy for God to exalt. You cannot rise without the grace of God, so remain humble, no matter how much you think you have already achieved (James 4:6).<br><br>The word of God says clearly that those who compare themselves among themselves are not wise (2 Corinthians 10:12). There is only one true judge and that is God. The teacher is in the best position to see his or her students’ mistakes. For example, if we were to ask Joshua, “How well have you done?” he most likely would have said, “Extremely well” since he achieved what Moses could not. However, God said:<br><br><b>Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</b><br>Joshua 13:1<br><br>God was essentially saying that Joshua failed because he could not finish his job. Don’t ever think that you are perfect because, if we were to count iniquity, no one would be able to stand (Psalms 130:3). Just thank God for how far He has brought you and pray for others around you. Nobody is better than the other; we must prefer one another in honour (Romans 12:10).",

      "In our Bible reading for today, you will see that God told Elijah to anoint three people to replace him. This is because you can see pride in Elijah’s response when he says, “And I, even I only, am left…”. There is only one “I AM” and that is God Himself (Exodus 3:14). This is why, when Jesus Christ called Himself ‘I AM’ in John 8:58-59, the Jews were furious that He compared Himself to God. Of course, at that time, they did not know about John 1:1 and 14, which says Jesus is God who became flesh and dwelt amongst us. The name I AM must be reserved for God and God alone.<br><br>When you search the Scriptures, you would discover that the words ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’, ‘mine’ are the languages of pride. That was the language of Satan in Isaiah 14:12-15. When you find someone always saying ‘I’, ‘my’, you know you are most likely dealing with a proud fellow. Beware of this because the higher you go, the greater the risk of you saying ‘I’, ‘my’, ‘me’ all the time.<br><br>We see an example in the strong and anointed man of God called Samson. In Judges 15:14-16, where the power of God came upon him and he killed thousands of soldiers with a jaw bone, he said, “With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men”. There was no, “Thank You, Lord” to the One who sent down the power; it was all about himself. Even when God had clearly restored his strength in Judges 16:25-28, when the enemies had caught him and plucked out his eyes and he wanted to pray just one more prayer before dying, what did he say?<br><br><b>And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</b><br>Judges 16:28<br><br>It was about him all the way. That is why, as strong and anointed as he was, he fell so low that he ended up blind and grinding corn for his enemies before dying with them.",

      "Death is likened to sleep in 1 Corinthians 15:51. In other words, a believer who is spiritually asleep is actually in a state of spiritual death. 1 Thessalonians 5:5-9 tells us clearly that we should stay awake spiritually, be watchful and sober. Matthew 24:42 says you must stay awake and be watchful, for you do not know what day your Lord is coming. Romans 13:11 encourages us that the Lord’s coming is nearer now than when we first believed.<br><br>Some believers keep going in and out of spiritual sleep. They feel it is normal to be cold and hot. I pity such people because their end is not usually good. A good example of this is Samson, who slept and woke up a number of times but the last sleep put him into the hands of his enemies. You may have slept a few times before and woken up again; however, you had better stop because there is always the last time a man would sleep and wake up to find himself being tortured by the enemy. If you used to love God with all your heart, but recently, other things have been competing with Him in your heart, then you are sleeping. God is saying to you like He said to the Ephesus Church in Revelations 2:4-5, “Return to your first love”. Ephesians 5:14 says if you awake, Christ will shine on you again.<br><br><b>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.\tEphesians 5:14</b><br><br>Beloved, get back to your first love now. Put away those sins that easily beset you. Go for a retreat, look for fellowships with genuine believers, make a habit of spending quality time daily in prayers and Bible study. Jesus is ready to shine on you again if you are willing to wake up and get back to Him. He loves you and He is calling you back home. Don’t let the devil or anyone else hinder you from going back to the One who loves you enough to die for your sins. When He shines on you, everything the devil stole during your time of slumber shall be restored and you will become a better person at the end of the day.",

      "The sleeping state of a man is a state when he is unaware of his surroundings and unable to change things around him. The enemies usually exploit this time to do evil. When a person sleeps spiritually, the devil would use that opportunity to steal from the fellow and destroy valuable things in his or her life.<br><br>During one of our conventions some years ago, there was a heavy rain and one of my children came to me and said, “Daddy what happened? You were supposed to be on the mountain praying”. I said, “I fell asleep; it was the rain that woke me up”. At first, when I awoke and saw the rain, I asked God, “Daddy, how could this be?” He replied, “I allowed it to rain because the crowd coming tonight will be much, so I need to cool the place down in readiness for them”. While I was asleep, the Devil was hoping the rain would discourage people from coming for the programme however, he did not know that God would make it favour us.<br><br>Believe it or not, as long as you are a Christian, the devil will fight you and if he finds you asleep spiritually, he will seek to devour you. If however, you are awake, you can resist him and he will flee from you. That is why we are warned in 1 Peter 5:8 to be vigilant. Stay awake so you can fight the enemy off. In Judges 16:19, it was while Samson was sleeping in the lap of a harlot that his supernatural strength was taken from him. It is important to note that when the devil wants to make a person sleep, he would provide things to please his or her flesh and this closes the person’s spiritual eyes. Sometimes, the devil uses money or career opportunities that take people away from their first love. That is why, no matter how good things get, you must always remain spiritually alert.<br><br>The reason I still go out on prayer walks at night, even at my age, is to avoid sleeping off.

You are sleeping spiritually when you are no longer excited to spend time with the One you call your Father. David prayed to God to restore unto him the joy of his salvation. This means he had lost the joy he used to feel as a child of God (Psalms 51:2).

We even see other people getting their prayers answered seemingly easily and wonder what our offence is that God has not answered us. In Genesis 30, the Bible says Rachel had no child for Jacob while Leah had birthed child after child for him, even as she aged. It must have really seemed as if God was not hearing Rachel’s prayers at all, but in verse 22, the Bible says: <i>“And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.”</i><br><br>One major prayer point that you must pray when it seems like God is not hearing your prayer is, ‘Remember me, oh Lord’. The first thing that happens when God remembers a person is that the fellow’s prayer would be answered. If you have been praying for one miracle or the other and there has been no answer, God will remember you this month, in Jesus’ name. Psalms 65:2 says: <i>“O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come”.</i><br><br>God hears prayers but the Bible says that if He is to answer, there are certain conditions that must be satisfied. For example, in Isaiah 55:6, the Bible says you must seek the Lord while He may be found and call on Him while He is near. Thus you may have been praying for a while, not even sure whether He is near or not because you cannot see Him, but when He chooses to remember, He Himself would draw near to you.<br><br>The second thing that happens whenever God remembers someone is that doors begin to open for the fellow. You may have been knocking on some doors that have stubbornly remained shut, but the One who remembered Rachel is He who has the key of David; when He opens, no man can shut and when He shuts, none can open (Revelation 3:7). If the enemy has shut a door against you, in the name that is above every other, this very day, it will be opened. All you need is for God to remember you.

One of my daughters was told that there was no way she could carry a child because her womb was blocked. At one of our programmes, God spoke through me that there was someone whom the doctor had said couldn’t have a child, but that the fellow would have twins. She believed the prophecy and held on to God’s word. To the glory of God, she became pregnant and went abroad to deliver through a caesarean section. To the surprise of the surgeons, she didn’t even have a womb. This was about twenty years ago. Recently, I got a phone call from this daughter of mine, and she said she wanted to bring the twins to me for a visit. I was surprised when she arrived, because she was carrying a new set of twins. The first set were now in the University and God, in His mercy, gave her another set of twins. God did what only He can do. If He could do it for that daughter of mine and you have been asking Him for a child, He will give you twins also, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Material barrenness refers to when a person works tirelessly with nothing to show for it - like Peter, who fished all night and caught nothing (Luke 5:5). Thankfully, Peter accepted Jesus into his boat, obeyed the Lord’s instruction and got a net breaking catch (Luke 5:1-7).<br><br>An example of academic barrenness is when a lecturer works very hard but can not publish papers and as a result, does not get promoted. Such people are referred to as academically barren. Ministerial barrenness can be observed when a pastor prays, fasts and evangelises but his Church does not grow.<br><br>Whatever form barrenness might have taken in your life or in the lives of your loved ones, I declare that it shall come to an end today, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Yesterday we discussed how the resurrection of Jesus Christ confirmed His Lordship. This, in essence, establishes that only the One with the power over death can be Lord indeed. Today we shall look at another aspect of Jesus Christ’s Lordship - His dominion over all calamities and sicknesses, as seen in Isaiah 61:1. Luke 4:18 also corroborates this:<br><br><b>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.</b><br><br>When Jesus was confronted face to face with the madman of Gadara, for example, He demonstrated this virtue as the Great Deliverer and Miracle Worker when He cast out the demons that had held the madman captive for years (Luke 8:26-39). Jesus came to preach the gospel to the poor for all-around salvation, and rebuked with authority all who tried to oppose Him. For example, He preached: <i>“Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves”</i> (Matthew 23:15). To this and many of His teachings, it was said: <i>“And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.” </i>(Matthew 7:28-29).<br><br>Our Lord Jesus Christ was asked to prove His Lordship in John 10:24-25. All He did was to simply refer His ‘interviewers’ to the work that His Father had been doing through Him. He said: <i>“...the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.”</i> (John 10:25).<br><br>As children of God, we must be able to represent Jesus Christ adequately. All you need is to give your life to Jesus and live by His commandments. <br><br>I prophesy to you today: you will graduate from being a miracle consumer to a miracle worker, in Jesus’ name.",

      "The Lordship of Jesus Christ was confirmed and established the day He resurrected from death because no one has ever done that by himself. The Bible says: <i>“And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”</i> (Matthew 3:17). This was repeated with greater emphasis according to the account of Luke on the Mount of Transfiguration where God, the Father, spoke to the inner caucus who were to spread the news later. The account says:<br><br><b>While he hath spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</b><br>Luke 9:34-35 <br><br>Even after all these, the world still had not accepted Him as the Lord.<br><br>However, from John 8:46 when He boldly questioned, <i>“Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?”</i> up to His death in Matthew 27:54 when the soldiers said to themselves, “…Truly this was the Son of God”, the Lordship of Christ was being confirmed and established. In our text for today, we read the account of the resurrection of our Lord:<br><br><b>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</b><br>Matthew 28:5-6<br><br>Apostle Paul wrote: <i>“But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain”</i> (1 Corinthians 15:13-14). May the Lord bless you as you exercise your faith in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. <br><br>The Bible says that anyone who believes in Jesus will not be condemned however, those who do not believe in Him are condemned already because they did not believe in the name of the only begotten son of God – Jesus Christ (John 3:18).<br><br>Which group would you like to belong to?",

      "There was this man called Mordecai – Esther’s uncle. There was also Haman - an officer of the king, who hated Mordecai. Haman expected everybody to bow to him, but Mordecai wouldn’t bow to anybody except God. Haman decided to hang him and destroy his people completely by getting the king to sign their death warrant of all the Israelites.<br><br>When Mordecai heard of the decree from the king, he went to Esther, who was then the queen, for help. Esther replied in Esther 4:1-17 that they should all fast, and then she would go and see the king. They fasted for just three days and things began to change from that point. By the time we got to Esther 5:1-6, Esther appeared before the king without being summoned and the first result of the fasting was that instead of the king asking her to be killed, he spared her life. Fasting can change death to life.<br><br>The next thing that happened is that Esther found unusual favour before the king. The king told Esther that though he is yet to know what she wants, but she should consider it granted already, even up to half of his kingdom. When you fast, you get more than you ask for. By the time we get to Esther 6, the king couldn’t sleep until he honoured Mordecai. A good deed that Mordecai did many years previously, which had been forgotten, made the king restless until it was repaid. When you take fasting seriously, all your past benefits that you have been denied can be brought forward and handed over to you.<br><br>In Esther 7, the enemy of the entire nation became completely uprooted, and then in Esther 8, the house of Haman was given over to Esther. Proverbs 13:22 says that the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just; do you think the wicked will let go of their wealth easily? You get it by fasting and praying. Wealth changes hands when you fast. Mordecai also got promoted because promotion comes from God (Psalms 75:6-7), and since fasting draws you closer to God, it leads to promotion.<br><br>Finally, in Esther 8:3-17, the Jews were saved from destruction, and the Bible also says all the people around became Jews because they were afraid of the Jews.

      "When you start fasting, you will notice changes which show that your flesh no longer controls you. First, fasting will bridle your tongue. During a fast, it becomes clear to you that many a time, you don’t gain anything by talking. James 1:26 says if you say you are religious and you cannot control your mouth, you are deceiving yourself. Thus, as you fast and talk less, you also sin less.<br><br>Fasting also helps you to control your temper, particularly prolonged fasting, because you would have no energy to fight anyone. When you get angry easily, it is because you have a lot of energy; let me see how you will get angry when you have been fasting for twenty-one days and nights! If anybody offends you, you would simply say, “God bless you, just leave me alone”. Ecclesiastes 7:9 says clearly that you should control your anger because anger rests in the bosom of fools.<br><br>You should ask yourself how come your body hates fasting. Galatians 5:17 says the flesh lusts against the Spirit. In other words, your flesh wants to fight the Spirit. If we do not say there is fasting tomorrow, you can wake up and not eat until 2 p.m., but once we announce that there will be fasting, some people would eat until midnight and still wake up hungry. This is because the devil does not want you to fast; this should tell you that fasting is good for you. When you learn to fast, you will be amazed that there are certain agents of darkness in your life that you have been coping with, but they move easily when you fast. Matthew 17:14-21 tells us that there was a demon the disciples tried their best to cast out but could not, without fasting and prayer. There are certain mountains that won’t move unless you back your prayers with fasting.<br><br>In Exodus 17:8-13, when there was a war to be fought between Israel and the Amalekites, Moses went to the mountain top and lifted his hands, while Joshua was below the mountain, fighting. Whenever Moses’ hands were up, the children of Israel would be winning the battle, but when his hands came down, they would start losing. The spiritual controls the physical. The solution to that lingering problem could just be some days of fasting in addition to your prayers.",

The flesh always wants you to commit sin, while the Spirit wants you to please God. If the flesh wins the battle, then ultimately, the devil has won over your soul; that is why you must put your flesh under your control at all times, and one of the major ways to do that is to fast often.<br><br>Only a few select people have fasted for forty days and forty nights. The only three recorded for us in the Scriptures are Moses, Elijah and Jesus Christ. It will interest you to know that only the three of them were there on the mount of transfiguration, glowing like the sun. Today’s message is not for the faint-hearted; it is for those who really want to grow.<br><br>Don’t let anybody tell you that fasting ended when Jesus Christ said, “It is finished” on the cross; fasting is for now. In Matthew 9:14-15, some people came to Jesus Christ and complained about His disciples not fasting. He said that after His death, resurrection and ascension, the people would fast. Fasting is for now, and we will fast until the Bridegroom returns. When He returns, there will be no need for fasting anymore because 1 John 3:2 says that when He returns, we shall see and be like Him. When the rapture comes, those who are not dead will have their bodies transformed to become like the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. At that time, we won’t need food; whatever He eats in His new body is what we will be eating, but until then, while your body is still the way it is, warring against the Spirit, you must fast to remain in the light of Christ.<br><br>There are those who will tell you fasting is not for the age of grace. They are big liars. Paul - the Apostle of Grace, said in 2 Corinthians 11:27 that he fasted often. He fasted often so he could subdue the flesh, and it would not cause him to be cast aside (1 Corinthians 9:24-27). Apostle Paul said many people run a race, but only one will win.

Students who refuse to study but say: “It is written; the Holy Spirit will remind us” should note that He would only remind them of what they have studied. If you don’t study, what would He remind you of? The youths in our Churches and nations must stop looking for quick money and work diligently. You have the internet and many things that have made your work easier. Those who work hard never beg. They become strong, wealthy and very great. Don't spend all your time on social media or watching television. The people you are watching are working hard to make something of themselves.<br><br>Many years ago, I was in my uncle’s house on a visit from school. One day, there were masquerades outside the house, and everyone watched and cheered them while I was studying inside. He came to me and said, “Won’t you go and see the masquerades?” I responded with a Yoruba proverb translated, “The person who will be watched does not go around watching people”. My uncle reminded me of that day because now, I am being watched. If you want to be great, you cannot be spending countless hours watching videos on social media. Get out there and work. Some people only pray and fast and then complain when things don’t get better for them. Praying and fasting are not the keys to success; they can only enhance your efforts. If you put in no effort, then what will it enhance? One million multiplied by zero is equal to zero.<br><br>One of my sons says that you must pray like you will not work and work like you will not pray. As prayerful as I am, even at my age, I wake up before the sun is up every morning to work. I don’t say because I prayed for six hours last night, then I should sleep all morning today; that is not how I got to where I am now. Believe me honestly, if you are lazy, God will not use you.

      "One of the major benefits of being a child of God is prosperity. Deuteronomy 8:18 says that God gives us the power to get wealth. In 3 John 2, He says clearly: <i>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”</i><br><br>One thing is clear from these Scriptures: God wants us to be prosperous. 2 Corinthians 8:9 even says that Jesus became poor so that we can be rich. The question now is: why does God want His children to prosper?<br><br>Firstly, no father would want his children to suffer. His children suffering would make him look like an irresponsible father. God wants you to prosper simply because you are His child. Psalms 128:1-2 backs this up: <i>“Blessed is every one that feareth the\xa0Lord; that walketh in his ways.For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.”</i><br><br>After you have become prosperous however, God wants you to use that wealth to build His Kingdom. Zechariah 1:17 said: “Cry yet, saying, <i>Thus saith the\xa0Lord\xa0of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the\xa0Lord\xa0shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.”</i><br><br>After God has prospered you, He expects you to use that prosperity to spread the gospel of His Kingdom. He expects you to do things to advance His kingdom on earth and win more souls for Him. This means that if you are prosperous and not sponsoring Kingdom projects, then you need to have a change of mind. You need to be more concerned about using your money for God than for any other thing.<br><br>David wondered how he could be living in a palace, when his God is being worshipped in a tent (2 Samuel 7:2). This made him set out to build a temple for God. He was so determined to spend for God that even when God told him not to build the temple, he did not keep his money to himself; rather, he provided everything that Solomon needed to build it. If you have this kind of heart, you would see how God will promote and bless you, even more than you can imagine.",

In other words, if you make a vow and you fail to redeem it, do not be surprised if you call on God in the day of trouble and He does not answer you. Today, many Christians just make vows casually. Many a time, even when making the vow, they have no intention of paying it. If you don’t pay your vows, yet cry out in the day of trouble, God would not listen; it is clearly written in the memory verse of today. Don’t postpone the payment of your vow when you can do it now. God sees those who do that as fools.<br><br>A vow is like a deal. When you make a deal with someone and you don’t fulfil your part of it, it is like stealing from that person. It is foolish to try to steal from God because what you are keeping away was provided by Him in the first place. If you made a deal with God, fulfil your part speedily. Worse still, some people make vows because they want the Pastor to pray for them at that moment, without any intention to fulfil it. How can you lie to God to receive blessings from Him? Is that not the height of foolishness? <br><br>Once you make a vow to God and the devil sees that you want to pay that vow, he will start telling you to defer it to later, saying that you don’t have enough yet or that God understands. Don’t listen to his lies so that God doesn’t see you as a fool.<br><br>One interesting thing about fulfilling a vow made to God is that the One you made it to has the ability to give you far more than you have promised to give Him. If you fulfil your vow, He would pour His blessings on you, but if you refuse to, He would also withhold what He would have given you in return. Hannah made a vow to God that she would give Him her son if He would bless her with one. This was after many painful years of waiting, and she didn’t know if she would ever have another child again. Imagine her holding her child in her hands at last and then giving the child over to God. Going back home without her child must have been a great sacrifice. She did it because that was her vow, and God gave her five more children in return (1 Samuel 2:21). Job 22:27-29 says it is those who pay their vows that can decree a thing, and it is established.

Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 5:12: <i>“For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.”</i><br><br>There comes a time in the life of a Christian when he or she ought to have started teaching others the gospel of Christ. Many believers don’t get to this level because they only read their Bibles rather than study it deeply. When you read, you read to be informed, but when you study, you study to be transformed. It is after you are transformed by the word that you begin to long to see that same transformation in others, and that longing pushes you to start teaching it. There are those who have memorised the longest chapter in the Bible, but they cannot teach the simple doctrines of faith because the word hasn’t transformed them. Don't just read the Bible, <i>study</i> it. When you experience the transforming power of the word, you will be eager to start teaching it too.<br><br>Another work that Jesus did which we are also expected to do, is the working of miracles. Miracles are not the exclusive reserve of Pastors only; they are for all Christians. Jesus said in Mark 16:17, <i>“These signs shall follow them that believe”.</i> As long as you are a child of God, when someone is sick around you, you are to lay hands on them so that they can recover. Many Christians don’t do this because while they have been in the faith for long, they have not been deliberate about their spiritual growth. Such people don’t spend quality time in God’s presence, praying, studying His word and seeking His anointing.<br><br>You must be deliberate about your spiritual growth because our Lord Jesus Christ expects you to grow in Him and perform greater works than He did during His earthly ministry.",

      "When a child is born, everybody is at his or her beck and call. The child is not expected to do any chore in the house. However, as the child begins to mature, he or she may then be sent on one errand or another. It is the same way in the Christian walk. When someone has just become born again, the fellow is being fed by the mature Christians. When he or she comes to Church, the workers would direct him or her on where to park the car, where to sit and attend to whatever needs he or she may have. As the fellow continues in the Church and becomes a mature Christian, he or she would no longer be comfortable with just being served, but would rather now want to serve in the house of God too.<br><br>A Christian that is growing spiritually becomes increasingly responsible. Such a Christian will sacrifice his or her time, because he or she is now living for God. There are however, those who have been attending Church for years, yet they don't do anything else apart from attending Church services. How can you be coming to Church without being a responsible part of the running of the house of your Father? While others may be thinking of what God can do for them, a Christian that is growing spiritually will focus on what he or she can do for God.<br><br>Beyond working for God, a Christian that is growing spiritually is always willing to give to the things of the Kingdom. Just like Paul, he or she does not mind spending and being spent for the progress of the Kingdom of God. While others are arguing about whether to pay tithe or not, a Christian that is growing spiritually is willing to give 100% of his or her income to God. A Christian that is growing spiritually will not complain when the Pastor says there is a need to be met in the Church; in fact, he or she would want to be the first person to meet that need.<br><br>Many years ago, there was a rich man who regularly gave towards Church projects and still helped supervise those who, unable to give financially, contributed their labour. One day, we suddenly saw him removing his clothes and joining in the physical labour. Surprised, we asked why and he said God had just told him, “Big man, well done; the people doing the work will get the reward that you will not”. Cheerfully giving your money, time, and energy to serve God are some of the signs that you are growing spiritually as a Christian. ",

      "After you have become born again for a while, the devil will try to test your faith. It is as you overcome these challenges and remain standing that you become mature in the things of God. At this stage, you would no longer be satisfied with the milk of God’s word; now, you would desire strong meat. A mature Christian wants to go deeper and not remain in the shallow waters of the word and ways of God.<br><br>Newly born again Christians, also referred to as ‘baby Christians’ must grow to the point where they can face trials and remain standing in Christ. Every Christian has low moments when the flesh seems to be rising above the spirit - periods when he or she could fall into sin if care is not taken. In such a period, someone who has been in Christ for a while but hasn’t been feeding on the word of God constantly is likely to fall. Proverbs 24:10 says: <i>“If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.”</i> The day of adversity will definitely come, but what will keep you standing is how much strength you gathered before that period.<br><br>How much of God’s word have you been consuming? How much praying have you been doing? How deeply rooted have you been in the things of God? These are the things that will go a long way in determining whether you will remain standing in the day of adversity. Know that the more mature you get, the bigger the adversity the devil is likely to bring your way, but we find solace in 1 Corinthians 10:13, which says: <i>“There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”</i><br><br>Thus, if a trial made you turn your back on God, it is not that trial really that brought you down, but rather your weakness in spiritual things. Jesus Christ said in our memory verse that if any man lays his hand on the plough and turns back, then he is not fit for the Kingdom of God. You have already laid your hands on the plough; build up your faith by engaging in spiritual activities like praying, Bible study, fellowship with other believers and so on. All these are required to enable you stand when the day of adversity comes.<br><br>Beloved, if you keep your Christian walk on a shallow level, you are likely to look back eventually and not make it to the Kingdom of God at the end of the day.",

When you see a fresh Christian during praise and worship, the fellow will be singing and dancing with joy, unlike some so called big men of God who have now become so familiar with the Lord that they can’t dance for Him anymore.<br><br>Many years ago, while waving my tambourine and dancing for my Maker during the praise and worship session at a Pastors’ meeting, a big man of God tapped me me and said, “Look at you, a whole General Overseer, dancing like that”. I told him I would never stop dancing for the One who made me the General Overseer of RCCG. David, with all his majesty, never outgrew dancing for God. In fact, 2 Samuel 6:14 says he danced with all his might. What was the result? God kept lifting him steadily. He went from becoming king of Jerusalem to king of Israel and kept progressing until he became the father of the King of kings. Even the key of God that opens and none can shut is called the key of David.<br><br>Fresh Christians never outgrow praising God even after several years of surrendering their lives to Christ. However, people who see themselves as too big to dance for God because they think they are no longer new in the faith have allowed themselves to become stale Christians.<br><br>Fresh Christians submit to the authority God has placed over them. You will always hear them say, “My Pastor said…”, and the blessings of obedience always follow them (2 Chronicles 20:20). Many years ago, my Father-in-the-Lord told all the workers in the Church to empty their bank accounts and bring the money to Church. The next Sunday, when he was meeting with us again, he said the need had been met, then he asked, “How many of you actually obeyed the instruction? Only my wife and I raised our hands. As far as we were concerned, it was God saying it, so we obeyed. The other people who had been in the Church long before us however did not obey. In return, God raised us to become the leaders of the Church.<br><br>You must never become so familiar with men of God that you begin to disobey and disrespect them.

      "When there is an evangelistic outreach the most beautiful part of the Scripture is usually preached so that unbelievers in attendance can be won for Jesus. The preacher would typically tell the congregation that when they come to Jesus Christ, they would find healing, deliverance, freedom, promotion and so on, and indeed, all these are true. Once they give their lives to Christ, they become fresh Christians. Fresh Christians are however, required to remain fresh at all times, just as we see in our Bible reading today. Yes, new converts are baby Christians who should grow into spiritual maturity, but they must never lose their freshness in Christ as they constantly renew their minds (Romans 12:2).<br><br>There are many distinct characteristics of fresh Christians. The very first thing is an insatiable hunger to know the word of God (1 Peter 2:2). People who just genuinely gave their lives to Christ don’t go late for fellowship. They even usually sit in front where there would be no distractions because they just have this strong desire for the word of God. Unfortunately, you see many people who have been born again for a long time forgetting this desire they once had. When you mature, you are supposed to advance to strong meat, but many fail to do this and rather become stale though they usually claim they have become mature. A Christian becomes stale when he or she stops feeding on the word of God daily.<br><br>Beloved, if you no longer spend quality time studying your Bible daily, you are becoming a stale Christian. Unless that hunger returns and you begin to feed on the word of God daily again, you are a dying Christian.<br><br>Another distinct characteristic of fresh Christians is that they cannot stop talking about Jesus. They are not ashamed of Christ at all. A Christian who has become stale however, will see himself or herself as too big to preach the gospel to everyone, forgetting Jesus’ command in Mark 16:15 and His warning in Matthew 10:33.<br>Freshness or staleness in Christ is not determined by how long you have been born again, but by your attitude towards the things of God.",

My own Bible says clearly in Romans 6:15: <i>“What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?

It is by grace that you are saved (Ephesians 2:4-5). After that, the grace of God that <i>brought you salvation will then teach you to live holy. “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,\xa0Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world”.</i> This is the true work of grace that the Bible talks about.<br><br><b>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.</b><br>2 Timothy 1:9<br><br>Please ignore anyone who tells you that the grace of God allows you to commit sin.

I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: <i>“And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.”</i><br><br>All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: <i>“Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.”</i><br><br>The passage does not say ‘the worm’ does not die, but ‘their worm’. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire.<br><br>There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their action or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely.",

And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel”.</i><br><br>Clearly, Jesus ascended to heaven. Now, He said in John 14:6 that no one can get to the Father in heaven except through Him. This is very clear. Many people say there are many ways to heaven; that is a lie.

Your attendance in Church is not a guarantee of your entry into heaven; the fact that you are a zealous worker or even a Pastor does not mean that you will go to heaven. Only an intimate relationship with Jesus - The Way upward, can guarantee your entrance into heaven. Eternity is not something to play games with. Some will be spending eternity in heaven with Jesus and His angels, enjoying forever, while others will be spending eternity in the lake of fire with the devil and his demons, suffering forever.

The Lord then said that if I wanted Him to keep promoting me, I had to let go of all my big titles and simply be addressed as ‘Pastor’.

This time, he was almost speechless. “Daddy, they discovered that their Managing Director resigned because their competitor offered him double the salary they were paying, and since they don’t want me to leave, they doubled my salary”. I congratulated him again, and he said, “No, speak another word”.

I was being relatively well paid but somehow, I wasn’t moving forward in life. I then met Christ and everything turned around - not because of any brilliance on my part, but rather simply because I gave my life to Christ and began to live holy.

      "Jesus being The Way also implies that He is The Way out of problems. There are problems in this world that you cannot solve no matter how intelligent you are, but there is no problem that Jesus cannot solve. Jesus Christ is the way out of sorrow.<br><br>In our Bible text for today, we read of a widow whose only son died. Nobody needs to tell us that she was in sorrow. She had known days of joy. The day she gave birth to this boy, she must have had joy then, but then the devil came in and steadily began to change her joy to sorrow, first by killing her husband and then coming for her only son. I can assure you that as they were going towards the burial ground, she was getting deeper and deeper into sorrow because she knew that there were people amongst those following her, pretending to be weeping with her and saying in their hearts, “Why is your case so bad? Are you the only one in town? There must be something you have done wrong that God is punishing you for”, but then she met Jesus Christ and the tide turned. For the mere fact that you are reading this today, sorrow is banished from your life forever, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>I was invited to preach at a private event in Ikoyi some years ago. I was going to preach on the topic, “O that Man should praise the Lord”, but as I waited in the hostess’ living room before the event started and observed the splendour of the house, I thought to change my topic entirely. I felt the hostess and her guests appeared to have everything they needed already but the Almighty God said I should talk to them about “You need a miracle”. I learnt later on that the woman had only one son who had gone so deeply into drugs that when his mother refused to give him extra money to buy them, he planted some in her bag when she was travelling to London so that she could be arrested at the airport. Everything seemed nice and beautiful on the outside, but deep inside, there was sorrow.<br><br>That day as I preached, the young man gave his life to Jesus, and the mother from that day on knew joy. If you too want to have joy for the rest of your life, the only way is through Jesus Christ. Let Him carry your burdens (Matthew 11:28).",

      "Jesus clearly loves names and according to our Bible reading today, His name is above all other names. Jesus calls Himself several names, some of which include ‘the Son of man’ (Matthew 18:11), ‘the Door’ (John 10:7), ‘Bread of life (John 6:35) and sometimes, He would even combine several names together. For example, He combined two names in John 11:25, three names in John 14:6, five names in Isaiah 9:6 and eight names in Revelation 1:8.<br><br>Everybody knows God as God, but when people get closer to Him; they begin to have other names for Him that are borne out of their experiences with Him. For example, in Genesis 22:14, Abraham came up with ‘Jehovah Jireh’ because God miraculously provided a lamb when he needed to make a sacrifice. In Exodus 17:15, Moses came up with ‘Jehovah Nissi’ because God helped them win the battle against the Amalekites and promised to wipe out their remembrance from under heaven.<br><br>God enjoys being called by names based on how He has revealed Himself to you. When I was younger, we used to have appellations amongst ourselves. For example, you could call your son Ade, but he could call himself Adesco. Thus, if you decided to send Ade on an errand and you want him to go cheerfully, you would call him Adesco. In the same way, when you are relating with God, and you want Him to do something for you, call Him a name that relates to that thing, and you will see Him move in accordance with the name you call Him. He is the One who established this Himself. In Exodus 15:26, when God was telling the Israelites that they would not get infected with the diseases of the Egyptians, He ended that statement by introducing one of His names to them; He said, “I am the Lord that healeth thee”. In Exodus 3:14, when Moses asked for God’s name, He introduced Himself as, “I am that I am”. This was a general name given to the Israelites because on their journey, they needed many dimensions of God. At different points, they needed God to provide for, protect and heal them, even to make a way for them. Thus, if you want God to move in a particular dimension, call Him by a name that relates to what you want Him to do for you.",

Am I winning more souls into the kingdom than I used to?”<br><br>You should also ask yourself, “Am I increasing financially or decreasing?” If there is a decrease, could it be that you have been eating your seed?

Could it be that, because you have been defaulting in your tithe and offerings, you are working under a divine curse (Malachi 3:8-9)?<br><br>Beloved, as a child of God, it is important to ask yourself these questions from time to time. If you discover that you are not experiencing growth in any area of your life, please consider your ways (Haggai. 1:5-7).

      "Another major benefit of righteousness is that when evil is about to come for you, God takes you out of its way and substitutes you with an unbeliever. This is clearly stated in Proverbs 11:8: <i>“The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.”</i><br><br>This is called the Law of Substitution. When trouble wants to swallow the righteous, God will stop it and may put a substitute in his or her stead. There are many instances like this in Scripture. The people who threw Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego into the fire are the ones who died instead of the Hebrew boys who were saved by the Lord, because the furnace had to be fed (Daniel 3). The people who threw Daniel into the den of lions were also the ones the lions ate (Daniel 6).<br><br>Many years ago, a lady came to me for prayers. She said she had a dream that her husband, who was on a trip, would be brought back in a casket. I asked her if her husband was born again, and she said yes. We prayed about the dream and she left. After some time, I saw an obituary in the newspaper, and the fellow there had the same surname as this sister. The following Sunday in Church, I asked her about the obituary wondering if it was her husband. She responded saying it was not her husband but a relative of his. Death was coming for a believer; God revealed it to us so we could pray and when we did, He delivered the righteous from death, while an unbeliever became the substitute. There is no life insurance policy as good as living holy.<br><br>When you live a righteous life, you go through life with boldness, knowing that tomorrow will be alright. The Bible says in Proverbs 28:1: <i>“The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.”</i><br><br>If you believe that the policemen around you carrying revolvers are your protectors, wait until they come across people carrying AK47s, then you will discover that you are on your own. The righteous are as bold as a lion because they know that they have God on their side. I want to challenge you to make a commitment today.

This is as opposed to Isaiah 59:1-2, which says that people’s sins have prevented God from hearing them. David said clearly in Psalms 66:18: <i>“If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me”</i>.

The children of righteous people are God’s responsibility; He takes care of their needs Himself. King David shared his observation about this in today’s memory verse.<br><br>The children of the righteous don’t have to depend on anybody to survive - God Himself makes sure that they don’t lack anything. This means that the best legacy and inheritance you can leave for your children is a holy lifestyle. This is so because God will ensure that they never lack.

He said, “No, I was told that whatever you prophesy comes to pass”. I said, “God has been faithful. How can I help you?” He responded, saying, “Can you tell me my future?” I asked, “Are you born again?” He said, “No”. I told him, “Your future will be terrible”. He said, “But how do you know; you don’t even know my name. You haven’t even prayed”. I responded, “I don’t have to pray. It is written in Isaiah 3:11,<i>?“Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him”,</i> and the word of God is forever settled”. He then asked, “What if I had said I was born again?”. I told him, “Then I would have said your future will be great, according to Isaiah 3:10. If you have given your life to Christ, then you can say confidently, “My tomorrow will be all right”.<br><br>Believe it or not, your walk with God will determine your future. If you do some evil things now and think you have gotten away with them, you are deceiving yourself. Unless you repent, ask God for forgiveness and begin to live holy, you would still reap the consequences of your sins (Proverbs 6:12-15).<br><br>When the Bible says in Galatians 6:7 that God is not mocked and that whatsoever a man sows shall he reap, it is no joke. Many people are suffering rejection, poverty, near-success syndromes, diseases and other forms of trauma today because of the unrighteous things they did in the past. Many go from Church to Church seeking deliverance, whereas their deliverance is in them repenting and restituting.

Even if you don’t want to fast for spiritual reasons, you need to fast for the sake of your health.<br><br>Truly, you may have a lot to do but that doesn’t mean you should not find a way to spend quality time with your family.

If you see a rich and popular fellow who doesn’t respect elders, you have seen someone who is not interested in living long. King Saul became wealthy and influential, so he stopped honouring Prophet Samuel. The result of that was his life becoming so miserable that he begged to be killed (1 Samuel 31:4). Samson thought because he was strong and influential, he could be with any woman he wanted, even against the advice of his parents and ended up being captured by his enemies.

If the Lord is not with you in your boat and the storm comes, who will you call upon?<br><br>Storms can come suddenly, without notice. Once while on a plane to London, there was a particular man who had a golden walking stick. From time to time, he would get up and show off his golden walking stick as he walked to and from the bathroom. Suddenly, the captain announced, “Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a little problem as we currently cannot land the plane”. The man with the golden walking stick now really needed to go to the bathroom; but as he stood up to go, the hostess asked him to remain seated. Obviously terrified, he refused to remain in his seat and for a moment, I too was afraid. I then said to my Daddy, “But Lord, You didn’t tell me this is the end”. He responded saying, “No, it’s not the end. I want to talk to you, and I know that as soon as you land, you will be kept busy, but we need to talk”. As soon as I heard His voice, His peace came to me. After the Lord finished talking to me, the plane landed without any problem.

The day I heard that story, I was so glad, because that means if my faith is not enough, I can cry to Him and He will make it grow.<br><br>When I became General Overseer, we loved to cook and eat together during our convention, but we were having challenges with the finances for the feeding and the parishes were groaning under the cost. One day during the convention, out of desperation, I said, “One day will come when you will be able to come to the Convention without bringing any money at all”. When we finished that night, and I got back to my office to pray, the Lord spoke to me, “Son, when do you want that to happen?” I said, “One of these days” and He responded, “Why not from now?” At that time we were about 10,000 people. How would I feed 10,000 people for one week? The Lord said, “Announce to the entire congregation that you will feed them next convention”. I said, “Daddy, I’ve never disobeyed You before, but this one? I can’t tell them”. He didn’t put any pressure on me, so the Convention ended and everybody left, but they came back the following month for the Holy Ghost Service and God repeated it. I said, “Lord, my faith can’t carry it”, and He said to me, “Son, you are about to lose a miracle”. I therefore announced, “Brethren, next year, don’t bring any money for feeding, you will be fed”. That was over 20 years ago, and God has not failed once.<br><br>You may think I am a man of great faith, but the truth is that my Daddy is the One who helps my little faith, so I depend entirely on Him.

      "One of the things I have discovered about God in my little walk with Him is that He wants to be your priority at all times. He said in Matthew 6:33 that you should seek His kingdom and righteousness first. In Psalms 10:4, the Bible describes those who do not seek God and have Him in their thoughts as proud. In Deuteronomy 26:2, God said that your very first harvest should be given to Him. He wants to be your number one or nothing at all to you. In fact, one of His names is ‘Jealous’ (Exodus 34:14).<br><br>Now, when God sees that you always put Him first and you have honoured Him, then He will begin to work out a befitting reward for you. In Proverbs 3:9-10, the Bible says: <i>“9Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 19So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine”.</i> In our Bible reading for today, Elijah told the widow of Zarephath to prepare his meal first before making that of herself and her son. Some other women would have said, “Prophet, did you not hear that there is only one meal left? If I prepare that one for you, there will be nothing left to prepare for me and my son”. Instead of saying that, she honoured God in the life of the Prophet in that difficult situation and in return, she never lacked food again. While the entire nation was starving, she had food in abundance. That is what happens when you put God first.<br><br>I was in Ilesha, holding a crusade many years ago when my Professor took my PhD thesis to the external examiner. Normally they post it, but he bought a ticket and took it. If you ask all those who got their PhDs back then, they will tell you that it usually takes months for external examiners to invite PhD candidates for an oral examination. While I was busy in Ilesha doing the will of God, my Professor took my thesis to the external examiner and said, “I am not going back until you read this”. After the external examiner read it, he said “Go and give the boy his PhD”. If you do the will of God first, He will take care of all your needs. When you honour Him and put Him first in all you do, what you will get in return will be a multiplication of what you sacrificed for Him.",

I was always so worried about the work of God and though I was just 40 years old, my hair had started to turn grey. I asked God, “Lord, why?” and He said, “You are carrying a burden that is not yours. You cannot share My glory. If you cannot share My glory, you cannot share My burden; let me carry My burden”.

I know I can’t beat him because he is too big, but we will fight until he kills me, and then the government will kill him, so that it will be a draw”. The next time he came to torment me, I said, “Don’t touch me”. Shocked, he said, “You spoke?” and hit me. I hit him too and He knocked me down. I got up and hit him again. He knocked me down several times but I kept getting up. After a while, he must have thought, “This boy wants to die”, so he ran away and I chased after him. The bully was now running from me because I refused to back down. From that day on, I had peace. Your Saviour is the Prince of Peace and He has already given you His peace (John 14:27).

      " In our Bible reading, Jesus was in the boat, yet there was a storm. This implies that Jesus can be in a person’s life, and a storm will still rage. Many think that once they are born again, they become a no-go-area for storms. That is not true; if anything, the devil will try harder to test your strength in Christ. Jesus Christ said it clearly in John 15:19, <i>“If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you”.</i><br><br>The mere fact that you are a child of God is enough to attract storms, but don’t worry; as long as Jesus is in your life, all you have to do is stir up His gift in you, and the storm will cease. If you are a child of God, Jesus is already in you, and the Bible says in 1 John 4:4 that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world. There can be a giant in you, but the giant can be sleeping until you wake Him up. 2 Timothy 1:6 says that there is a gift of God in you, and you have to stir it up. Psalms 50:14-15 says that if you come into the presence of God with thanksgiving, you can then call upon Him in the day of trouble and He will deliver you. Call on Him until He arises for you, because it is written in Psalms 68:1 that when God arises, His enemies scatter.<br><br>You can get the Almighty God to arise for you by prayer. In Acts 12:1-10, when Herod took James, the Church did not pray, and so James was killed. By the time Peter was arrested, the Church had learnt their lesson and thus prayed, getting the Lord to arise for them to still that storm. If you refuse to pray, the storm can overwhelm you, but if you pray, then you will win against the storm no matter how much it rages.<br><br>You can also cause Him to arise for you through praise. In Mark 10:46-52, when Bartimaeus was calling on Jesus, the Lord kept hearing, “Jesus, thou son of David…”, so He stopped to attend to Him. When you praise Him, He will arise for you. If you know how to call God His names in line with who He really is, He will pay attention to your situation and still any storm that rises against you. ",

In those days, no matter how much you give to a man, you can collect those things back if you don’t give him your shoes (Ruth 4:7-8). Also, servants never wore shoes. Thus, Jonathan was telling him, “I love you greatly, but don’t forget that I am a prince and you are an ordinary citizen in this kingdom”.<br><br>Another thing you can learn from the story of Joseph is that if human beings promote you, they can also bring you down. It is the same Potiphar who made Joseph the head of all his slaves who later threw him in prison. Those shouting ‘Hosanna’ today may shout “Crucify him” tomorrow. When God decided to promote Joseph, He brought him to a level so high that even Potiphar – his former slave master, had to bow before him. The Most High will promote you and very soon, all those who have been oppressing you will bow before you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Almighty God took David - who was a shepherd boy, made him a king and kept on promoting him until he became the father of the King of kings (Revelations 22:16).

      "Today, I want to introduce you to the other side of the Most High. You already know from previous discussions that He can overrule anybody, but did you know that He can also overrule Himself? In Isaiah 38:1-8, the Most High sent His Prophet to King Hezekiah to tell him that he was about to die. Hezekiah prayed to God to give him some more time on earth, and the Most High granted him 15 more years. The Prophet must have wondered, “But Lord, forever O Lord, Your word is settled” (Psalms 119:89), and God must have responded, “I am the One who said it. I am the One reversing it.” That is an example of God overruling Himself to answer a man’s prayers. He can also overrule Himself to punish a man. When you read 1 Samuel 2:30, you see Him overruling Himself to punish Eli. This is where we need to be very careful.<br><br>In 1 Samuel 9:15-17, He chose Saul, who was the least in the least of the tribes in Israel, to be king. However, Saul became arrogant and God decided to reject him. At the end of the day, God sent a tormenting spirit to him and then made sure that he and his sons died on the same day. I am sure that if Saul knew that he would end up that way, he would never have disobeyed God.<br><br>The Most High is a wonderful friend to have. When He is on your side, He can overrule anybody or anything that is against you, but He is a very dangerous enemy. If He was once your friend and becomes your enemy, you are in trouble. This is why I want to appeal to you again to surrender your life to Him. The Most High is not someone you toy with. He is not someone you can cheat or deceive, He knows all things. He knows those who pretend to belong to Him but are still doing the will of the devil. Before He changes His mind, I beg you to surrender to Him and let Him be your friend for life. If you claim that He is your Lord, serve Him in total surrender. Serve Him with all your heart and in sincerity. Worship Him in Spirit and in Truth, and the result will be beautiful.

Many years ago, a woman came to deliver her baby at our maternity centre in The Redeemed Christian Church of God. Apparently, because she had been barren for many years, she had uttered a statement saying she didn’t mind dying, as long as she gave birth first. Now, she had gotten pregnant and didn’t want to die during childbirth, so she came to the Church’s maternity centre to deliver the baby.

Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:15 that he was originally the chief of sinners, but then he had an encounter with Jesus Christ and instead became a chief amongst the Apostles (2 Corinthians 11:5). I have always said, “If the Almighty God can use me, He can use anybody”. If He could take me from the path of hell and put me on my way to heaven, then whatever claim hell has over you is overruled right now, in Jesus’ name. You must note however, that you have a role to play in ensuring that hell’s claim over you is completely overruled.

Every now and then, you need to shout the name JESUS so that your problem will hear it and flee. His throne is higher than any other because it is in the heavens, far above all principalities and powers. His army is bigger and stronger than any other because He controls all the hosts in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth. According to Philippians 2:9-11, not only is His name higher than any other, His influence is also in all the spheres because, in Heaven, on earth and underneath the earth, knees bow to Him. The fact that God is the Most High however, has certain implications. We will begin to discuss this today and over the next few days.<br><br>Firstly, being the Most High, He has the last say over every matter. If you have a case in a High Court and the judge finds you guilty, you can appeal the ruling. If the Appeal Court says you are guilty, you can appeal to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court says you are guilty, the President may decide to grant you a state pardon. There is however, somebody higher than the President and that is the Almighty God. He is not a President, a Prime Minister, or a King. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. He is the King who decrees a thing and it stands fast (Psalms 33:9).<br><br><b>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</b><br><br>Matthew 10:28.<br><br>In Exodus 5:1-2, the world's greatest ruler then was Pharaoh. Moses relayed God’s message to him saying, “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness”. Pharaoh refused and said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go?” By the time God had finished with him, he was the one begging the people to go. If you disobey God, it means you love death (Proverbs 8:36). If you have any wisdom, you will fear the Most High and stay away from anything that can offend Him. ",

      "Many people are in the miry clay of life. A miry clay is a situation so terrible, you cannot get out of it by yourself; you need external help to get you out of it. When the doctor tells someone that they have done their best and there is nothing more they can do to make the fellow feel better, he knows that at that point, except God comes to his aid, he is finished. Thankfully, I have a God who specialises in lifting people out of the miry clay and placing their feet on the rock to stand firm (Psalms 40:2).<br><br>What do you do for the Almighty God to pull you out of the miry clay? The first thing is to realise that it is sin that brought you into the miry clay in the first instance. When the paralysed man was brought to Jesus in Mark 2:1-12, the first thing the Lord said to him was, “Your sins be forgiven you”. The word of God is clear: the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Sickness is an agent of death. You must repent and forsake your sins before you can come out of the miry clay. The Lord told the man at the pool of Bethesda, “Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee” (John 5:14). If you don’t get rid of sin in your life, you may never get out of that miry clay. David said in Psalms 66:18: <i>“If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:”</i> How can you be expecting an answer from God when He cannot even hear your prayers at all?<br><br>I was invited to Tunisia about 11 years ago to speak at the World Prayer Conference and I said, “Brethren, I have come to submit to you that God answers all prayers.” Some deep theologians called me aside and said that it is not true. Don’t let anybody deceive you, God answers prayers. He said, “Call on me and I will answer you” (Jeremiah 33:3). He didn’t say, “I may answer you”. The only variable there is, He can only answer the prayers He hears. If He doesn’t hear, how will there be an answer? Isaiah 59:1-2 says clearly that it is our sins that prevent God from hearing us.<br><br>If you are still obeying God half-heartedly, change your ways. It is in your best interest to do so. ",

      "In Psalms 40:1, David said God inclined unto him and heard his cry - not his whisper, but his cry. A cry in this context is a prayer made with violence. Matthew 11:12 says, <i>“And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”</i><br><br>You must therefore be violent in your dealings with things of the Kingdom of heaven. In Mark 10:46-52, the kind of prayer that Bartimeous prayed is what we call a cry. There was a multitude there just like there are multitudes calling on God every minute, but in the midst of that multitude, one man cried and God inclined His ear to Him.<br><br>When you cry to God and He inclines His ear to you, He lifts you out of the miry clay. Miry clay simply means a situation so bad that unless help comes from outside, you are done for. The more a person in quicksand struggles, the deeper he or she would go into it. It is a situation where there is nothing you can do on your own to be free. When in that kind of situation, you don’t whisper, you cry. There is a practical example in Mark 2:1-12, where a man paralysed from the neck down was brought to Jesus. Every part of his body was dead except the neck upwards. There was nothing any doctor could do for him, but thank God for Jesus Christ. When Jesus saw him, He said, “Arise” and he came out of the miry clay. In the name that is above every other, you will come out of the miry clay.<br><br>Another example is in 2 Kings 4:1-7, where the widow of the son of the prophet was so badly in debt, the creditors said they would sell her children within 24 hours if she didn’t pay. She didn’t whisper, she cried to the man of God. Before the 24 hours were up, she had more than enough to pay her debt. I pray for you that God will incline His ears to you today as you cry out to Him, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Whenever people cried unto the Lord again and again, He would eventually turn and attend to them. Let that be your disposition when you go to God in prayer. Don’t pray like a gentleman or lady, with finesse. Cry to Him with all your strength, and He will incline His ear to you. ",

      "In our Bible reading for today, David said he waited patiently for the Lord. This statement could be interpreted to mean ‘I waited for God’s time’. This is because God has a timetable He works with as we see in Psalms 102:13.<br><br>This however, does not mean that God is bound by time. For example, in Isaiah 38:8 when the king wanted a sign that God had heard his prayer, the prophet said confidently that the sun would move 10 degrees backwards and it was so. In Joshua 10:12-14, God helped Joshua stop the sun from setting so the Israelites could finish off their enemies. In John 11:21, Mary told Jesus that He came too late as her brother was already dead, but the Lord reversed the irreversible and Lazarus came back to life. God can reverse time for your sake too, just ensure you wait patiently on Him in faith.<br><br>‘I waited patiently’ could also mean, “God, you are my last bus stop. I am not going anywhere else until You answer me”. In Genesis 32:24-29, Jacob refused to let the angel go unless he blessed him. It may interest you to know that God likes it when you refuse to let Him go until He blesses you. In Luke 18:1-8, Jesus taught about persistent prayers using the example of a widow who would not let a wicked judge rest until she got justice. He explained that if you stay put with God, you will get what you are asking for. The daughter of the woman in Matthew 15:22-29 was delivered of unclean spirits because her mother refused to leave Jesus alone, even when He told her to go away since she wasn’t a Jew.<br><br>David said after waiting patiently for the Lord, He inclined to him (Psalms 40:1). When God inclines His ear unto you, you can be sure that you would receive your miracle, because whenever God pays attention to someone, a miracle always follows.

      " Over the past six days we learnt that God first draws you to Him and if you yield, He saves you by cleansing you with His blood. Sanctification and baptism in the Holy Spirit then follows, after which you receive the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit. We will round off this study today by looking at how the Lord brings His children to perfection.<br><br>Our Lord Jesus said in Matthew 5:48, <i>“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”</i> In this context, perfection can be easily understood as when you only do things that edify. There are some things that may not be regarded as sin in themselves but then, they are not edifying. The place of perfection is when you avoid such things. This is when you begin to see some things that, though lawful, are not expedient for you to do (1 Corinthians 10:23).<br><br>For example, gossip may not be viewed as a sin, but does it edify you? Only a few people get to this stage in their walk with Christ - where they have gone beyond just what is sin and what is not, engaging only in things that edify them while avoiding things that don’t.<br><br>One of the signs that a person is experiencing this work of grace is that the fellow will pay attention to doctrine. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us that all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is therefore profitable, amongst other things, for doctrine which will lead you to perfection. Thus, even when you have been performing miracles, signs and wonders, you still need to pay attention to doctrine because <i>“Forever O Lord, thy word is settled”</i> (Psalms 119:89).<br><br>God is therefore saying to you, whatever level you are in now, “Come up higher”. Don’t just stay on the level of being cleansed of all your sins, move to being sanctified. Don’t think that the moment you can speak in tongues, then you have arrived; go on to receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit and then ensure you also produce the fruit thereof, so that the gifts don’t destroy you. And lastly, be amongst the rare set of people who are made perfect (Matthew 5:48). You have to keep going higher until you become perfect, such that people would look at you and say that you are a true child of God. ",

      "As we continue with our lessons on the works of grace, we will study a manifestation of the Holy Spirit in believers called ‘the fruit of the Holy Spirit’. If a Christian has gifts of the Holy Spirit but does not have the fruit of the Holy Spirit listed in our Bible reading of today, such a person is headed for destruction. An example of this is when a believer becomes proud because God performs miracles through him or her. Matthew 7:22-23 says: <i>“Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity”.</i> They had the gifts of prophecy and working of miracles, but God didn’t even know them. That is because though the gift was present in their lives, the fruit was absent. This is why you must never be satisfied with just having the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The fruit is more important than the gift, so you must ensure that you experience this important work of grace.<br><br>According to Galatians 5:22-23, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance. While you may already be working miracles, God is asking you to move higher. You may be performing miracles, yet are difficult to live with; you might get the gifts and still end up in hell. What will it profit you if you are a powerful evangelist but get left behind when the rapture takes place? Of what use is your anointing if you will end up in the same place as the devil? Anointing is good and I love it, but I don’t want to be anointed and then become a candidate of hell; God forbid. Jesus Christ said if you want to know those who will go to heaven, look out for the fruit of the Holy Spirit in them, not the gifts.<br><br><b>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</b><br><br>Matthew 7:20-21<br><br>Don’t be deceived by the anointing of God already at work in your life.

      " Having the Holy Spirit does not mean that you have arrived - not at all. He gave you the Holy Spirit for a reason and that is to witness according to Acts 1:8. A witness is someone who tells others about what they have seen or heard. When God asks you to witness, He is saying you should tell people about the things you have heard and seen about Him. To really prove that what you are telling them is true, He gives you gifts of the Spirit. This is the work of grace that comes after the Holy Ghost baptism.<br><br>There are basically nine gifts of the Holy Spirit, as seen in 1 Corinthians 12:7-11 and they can be grouped into three. One group is called the revelation gifts. The revelation gifts consist of the Word of Wisdom, Word of Knowledge and Discerning of Spirits. When you hear someone say something about you that he or she could not possibly have known except God told him or her, that is the Word of Knowledge. For example, while I am preaching many times, God tells me things about people in the congregation and I announce it starting with, “There is someone here…”. Despite not knowing these people, what I announce is usually the exact situation of the person involved - that is the Word of Knowledge at work. God knows all things and from time to time reveals them to those whom He has given this gift to. It is a powerful gift of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>There is another group of gifts called the Power Gifts – the Gift of Faith, the Gift of Healing and the Gift of the Working of Miracles. Then of course there are three others called the Vocal Gifts - these are the Gifts of Prophecy, diverse kinds of Tongues and the Interpretation of Tongues. The Almighty God can give you any of these 9 gifts after you are baptised in the Holy Spirit and have started working for Him. Interestingly, 1 Corinthians 12:31 says: <i>“But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.”</i><br><br>The only place in the Bible where you are allowed to be covetous is when it comes to the gifts of the Holy Spirit. After my Holy Spirit baptism, I asked God for all the gifts and He answered me. I give Him glory and honour that when you ask Him, He is more than willing to give. ",

      "As we continue with our study of the works of grace, we will consider the baptism of the Holy Spirit today. After God has enabled you to do His will voluntarily without being forced, He will then baptise you in His Spirit. When we were younger Christians, we were told, “You must be sanctified before you begin to ask for baptism in the Holy Spirit”. The Holy Ghost baptism is very dangerous, so much so that it can even destroy a person.<br><br>In those days, people gave offerings voluntarily - nobody needed to preach to you. We were willing to spend and be spent for the One who saved us; He had given us a new heart - a heart of flesh. After you have become sanctified, God can then trust you with His Holy Spirit and power. The Holy Spirit cannot live in a heart that is still stubborn, unruly and disobedient<br><br>.Baptism in the Holy Spirit comes with power (Acts 1:8) and thus, you need to be sanctified before that can happen. Beloved, the Holy Spirit is like a bomb. Nobody will give a bomb to someone who is not broken. When you join the army, they take you through a series of training programmes and by the time they are finished with you, you would almost be like a zombie. You would begin to do everything they ask of you without questions. When you become a Christian, you have joined the army of the Lord and until you are thoroughly broken, He won’t give you His power. Don’t mind those who pretend to be operating in the power of God while their behaviours are not portraying Christ; Simon the sorcerer could also perform some magic. If you want the true power of God, you must be sanctified first. Carnality must be gone from your life, so that He can release His power to you.<br><br>When the baptism in the Holy Ghost happens, one of the primary evidences will be speaking in tongues. No one will have to tell you what to say. The day I was baptised in the Holy Spirit, it was the Lord Himself who drove my car home because I wasn’t in this world; all I knew was that I had no control over my tongue. That kind of true power is available for you, provided you are sanctified. After receiving this power, you then become a witness to Him as He said in Acts 1:8. ",

      " We looked at the first two works of grace over the past two days and would be discussing the third work of grace today. The third work of grace happens after we have become children of God through the blood of Jesus cleansing us of all sins. The Lord at this stage, brings closer to Himself a select group. Matthew 22:14 says: <i>“For many are called, but few are chosen”</i>. This chosen few become what I would like to call the favorites of the Almighty God.<br><br>In the olden days, a king could have as many wives as he wanted, but there would still be one who would be his favourite. After salvation, there is always a select group of people who are just closer to God than everyone else. They are not like everyone else - they love God more; they serve Him more committedly. These are the ones who don’t come for what they can get; they serve Him whatever the cost. We call these people the Sanctified - people who are set apart for God.<br><br>Now, these people who are sanctified are given a new heart. Ezekiel 36:26 says: <i>“A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh”</i>. Many Christians never get to this level before they die and that is a pity. This is why we have so many Christians, yet, only a few are actually living holy.<br><br>The one that the Almighty God is going to set apart for Himself must be completely dead to the world. He must be put to sleep so soundly that there is nothing anybody can do that will distract his attention from God. These are the ones who will say like Paul in Galatians 2:20:<br><br><i>“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”</i><br><br>In the past, one of the ways by which we identified these sanctified people is that they are difficult to annoy. They are so occupied with their Groom - the Lord Jesus Christ, that there is very little you can do to offend them. Sanctified people are those who will suffer any wrong and take it calmly, rather than allow an unbeliever to say, ‘And you call yourself a child of God’. ",

      "We identified the first work of grace to be God’s call to man for salvation. Once a person heeds this call and surrenders all to God, He moves on to the next work of grace - salvation.<br><br><b>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</b><br><br>1 John 1:7<br><br>Salvation is the point at which God blots out all your sins of the past and gives you a clean slate to start with. Many people find it hard to believe that God can cleanse their sins completely, but that is the exact truth. It doesn’t matter how badly you have sinned, Jesus can make you a new creature in Him. That is why the salvation experience is referred to as being ‘born again’. The devil has no grounds to accuse you of any past sin.<br><br>When you become saved, the first thing you will notice is that you experience peace like a river. This is because sin is a weight on your heart. Matthew 11:28-30 says after Jesus draws you and you come to Him, if you decide to take His yoke on yourself, He will take your burden and then you will have rest. The burden He takes from you is the burden of sin. Once that burden is lifted, your soul will be at peace. This peace is difficult to describe but when you experience it, you will know. If you have never experienced it before, then you need Jesus to save you and cleanse you from all sins. If you don’t have that peace anymore, you need to run back to your Saviour and rededicate your life to Him.<br><br>The second thing that marks the salvation experience is joy – the joy of the Lord. It will be impossible to hide this type of joy. The Monday after I gave my life to Christ, when I got to work, my Head of Department could practically see that I was radiating with joy. He asked if I had attended a party during the weekend. I told him I hadn’t attended any party, but I got the invitation to a wedding where I am the bride and Jesus is the groom. Once your sins are cleansed, your soul begins to rejoice. Anyone who backslides always notices that the joy they used to feel is gone. That is why David said in Psalms 51:12 that God should restore unto him the joy of his salvation. ",

Although He hasn’t come yet, believe me honestly, His coming is far nearer than it was then; He will soon be here. Since this race is a marathon, then it means that in addition to strength, you would also need endurance if you want to run the race successfully. Endurance comes by the special grace of God which He makes available to keep you standing until the end. These are the works of grace.<br><br>When I became born again, we were taught that there were three works of grace that God makes available to Christians - Salvation, Sanctification and the Holy Ghost Baptism. I decided to check further and discovered that there are at least 7 steps in this process. From our Bible reading, you will discover that the first thing God says He will do even before Salvation is to gather His own together (John 6:44). You cannot be saved unless God draws you first.<br><br>When I came to The Redeemed Christian Church of God, it was because I had a problem my education could not solve and God used that problem to draw me to Himself. When somebody is talking about their salvation experience and they say, “I found the Lord”, they are only speaking from their limited knowledge. God was never missing; it is He who found you (John 15:16). This is why, if you are truly saved now, you should always thank God for the salvation of your soul.<br><br>It is however, possible that God could be drawing a man, yet the man refuses to come to Him. The end of such people is always disastrous. There was a popular chief God sent me to preach salvation to and every time I visited, he would say, “Not yet”. One day, he had a stroke that rendered him unconscious; I was called to pray for him and within one hour, he was restored to perfect health as if nothing at all had gone wrong. This time I told him, “I feel God is giving you a last chance; will you give your life to Christ now?” Again, he said, “Not yet”. The next time I heard about him, he was dead. If God is drawing you to Himself and you keep refusing, you are telling Him clearly that you prefer hell to heaven. You had better surrender to Him now for your own good. ",

      "To enlarge means to make bigger, implying that anytime there is enlargement, there must be two important factors involved - the object to be enlarged and the fellow who is going to be the enlarger. You are the one to be enlarged and the enlarger is the One spoken about in Genesis 1:28: <i>“And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”</i><br><br>The Scripture above didn’t say, “Be fruitful and increase”, but rather “Be fruitful and multiply”. This implies that if you are truly fruitful, then you will multiply; that is the true meaning of fruitfulness. God is not interested in addition, but rather, multiplication. You must seek to multiply over and over again. Why then are many people, including Christians satisfied with the status quo? Some are satisfied with getting a little increase in their salary every two years, some pastors are satisfied with just sitting over one parish of their Church with the same number of people for several years. This is as good as a taboo, especially when you consider the status of the Person who said, “Be fruitful and multiply”. There is a popular saying that goes thus: “Garbage in, garbage out”. Your current results are a reflection of the work you have been putting in. If you really want to multiply, then you must multiply your efforts too; you must multiply everything you have been doing, in order to get the desired results. If you do this, you would soon realise that your results have also multiplied.<br><br>Multiplication is in levels; some people will multiply thirty-fold, some sixty-fold and some a hundred-fold and so on. Multiply your input in proportion to how much increase you desire in your output. Multiply your input in prayers, in work, in study, in giving and so on. Just before the Lekki ’98 crusade where we had the largest religious gathering in the world at the time, I told my partners that if I thought I had fasted before, I was only joking because for the result we were trusting God for in that programme, I needed to fast far more than before. Luke 6:38 says that it is with the same measure that you have given that it will also be given to you. ",

      "God wants the body of Christ to always go from glory to glory. He wants it such that men and women of God have followers who operate in greater measures of anointing. That is why He said we should make disciples of nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As powerful as He was during His earthly ministry, before leaving He said:<i> “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father”</i> (John 14:12). No matter how greatly anointed your spiritual father is, God can anoint you more than him. You may be asking, “Are you saying that God can anoint me more than you?” Yes, indeed He can.<br><br>There was a woman who was in the Redemption camp when she received a call that her daughter had died while giving birth to a set of twins, both of whom had also died. After the programme, she went to the hospital and took with her a bottle of anointing oil that we had blessed, dropped a little of the oil in the twins’ mouths and said, “Don’t waste my time; come back to life” and they both came back to life. The body of her daughter was just about to be wheeled to the mortuary at the time, she stopped the hospital staff, poured a little anointing oil on the daughter, placed an anointed handkerchief on her head and the daughter also came back to life. She raised three people from death in one day. Even I haven’t raised more than one person from death in one day yet. Thus, you can do even more than your Father-in-the Lord. For all my children, the anointing on you will be much more than the one on me, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The reason we have had many great men of God in the past and no one to carry that same measure of anointing now is simply that many people are not willing to serve the anointed with all their hearts. Not many people can carry the same burden that their Fathers-in-the-Lord do. If your soul is occupied with the world, you cannot carry the anointing of your Father-in-the-Lord whose focus is completely on doing the will of God. Elisha got a double portion of Elijah’s anointing because he remained loyal and committed to the latter.",

      "Restoration can be simply described as the process of returning something to its original state. Divine restoration is an act of God because only the Creator of heaven and earth has the knowledge and ability to restore humanity to its original state. The unfortunate error of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden robbed mankind of their dominion in creation. This led to separation from God and attracted death and other terrible curses. Thereafter, life became full of different kinds of sins - idolatry, immorality, wickedness - until life became unbearably difficult. At this point, our loving and compassionate God decided to end the misery by restoring man’s dominion through redemption by the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Restoration is a complete package that includes forgiveness of sins, freedom from guilt and mercy rather than judgement. It usually comes as an act of mercy, favour, compassion, and love, with the sole aim of reconciling mankind to God. Restoration often involves the remission of sin, cancellation of debts, and reversing the irreversible. Our God is a God of restoration. Jesus restored life to Lazarus in John 11:43-44 and the son of the widow of Nain in Luke 7:11-15. He restored sight to a man born blind in John 9:1-7. Our God can restore ill health, failing businesses, damaged relationships, broken marriages and lost opportunities. All you need to do is cry unto Him in prayer. May you be fully restored in every area of your life, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Bible teaches that as God is, so He wants us to be in this world. We must forgive everyone that has offended us while also seeking the forgiveness of those we have offended. Forgiveness is to be without limits, as stated in Luke 17:3-4 and Matthew 18:21-22. Forgiveness leads to peace, reconciliation, healing, progress, joy, prosperity, and answered prayers. Make up your mind to be at peace with all men (Hebrews 12:14), forgive everybody that has offended you and settle all pending disputes with your neighbours. Let the love of God radiate through you to others so that you would become a beneficiary of the abundant blessings of the Lord. Be restored to God first, then pursue restoration of every broken relationship as God guides you.",

      "God wants you to grow spiritually so that you would eventually become a giant in the spirit realm. In 1 Corinthians 12:31, God says you are allowed to covet earnestly the best gifts. When I read that passage, I told God, “Lord, give me a double portion of the Spirit of Elisha, double the spirit of Peter, double the spirit of Paul, double the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry, add everything together and double it again”. He responded that I was asking for trouble because people would not let me rest. I said I wanted it still because I could not afford to be anything else but a spiritual giant. You must make up your mind not to be an ordinary Christian from today.<br><br>If you want to become a spiritual giant, 2 Kings 2:1-8 teaches that you must be loyal to your own Elijah. When Elijah wanted to leave this world, Elisha followed him three times; each time, Elijah told him to go back, but he refused. Your Elijah is your father-in-the-Lord. In 2 Kings 2:9-15, when Elijah was departing, Elisha got a double portion of his spirit.<br><br>One day, I was praying that my children would be greater than I, and one of them said, “Anyone who will be greater than you probably will never eat again”. He said that because of how often I fast, but then I told him not to leave God out of the equation. It doesn’t matter how great God made your father-in-the-Lord, you can become greater just by honoring and being loyal to him. Elisha got a double portion of the spirit of Elijah because he pursued the same vision as he.<br><br>Learn to minister to the one whom God has placed over you spiritually. In 2 Kings 3:11-12, the Bible tells us that Elisha ministered constantly to his spiritual father. It wasn’t long after that in 2 Kings 13:14 that we read that a king called him ‘Father’. If you are committed to honoring your father-in-the-Lord by serving him, you would receive something that you could otherwise have laboured greatly in the spirit to get. Somebody once said that the tail of a lion is more powerful than the head of a dog. Your father-in-the-Lord is already a lion; if you are committed to following Him as he follows Jesus, you can do greater things than when you are on your own. ",

If you want to increase in influence, do what He says. <br><br>One major thing He said you should do is to win souls. Our Bible reading for today says you can become Jesus’ friend and I’m telling you, when you befriend the Lord, you become very influential because of your relationship with He who has influence across all realms (Philippians 2:10). When you become a friend of Jesus Christ, doors open to you automatically.

Many believe that people’s fates are decided by God no matter what they do. If you pay attention to the first part of our Bible reading today, you will see the word, ‘Foreknow’. Your destiny is determined by His knowledge of the things you will do and the decisions you will make throughout your lifetime. In other words, your destiny is ultimately decided by you.<br><br>If God tells you your destiny now, it is based on all the knowledge He has about you. For example, God knows all that you have done in the past. In 2 Kings 5:20-27, when Gehazi collected Naaman’s gifts secretly, Elisha didn’t leave the house, but he saw everything. Gehazi lied about what he had done and became destined to be a leper and a father of lepers.

The fact that you are alive today reading this particular message means there is hope for you to end well. In Luke 23:39-43, a criminal on his way to hell got salvation at the last minute.

      "If I were to ask you, “Which do you consider more important - the blessing or the Blesser?” you are likely to say it is the Blesser.

When you begin to choose your job over God, you are prioritising the blessing over the Blesser. I want you to do an honest check within yourself now: which one have you been prioritising – the blessing or the Blesser?<br><br>The unfortunate thing about prioritising the blessing over the Blesser is that the Blesser can withdraw His blessings at any time. In 1 Samuel 16:1, God told Samuel to stop pleading on Saul’s behalf because He had given the throne to someone else. In Genesis 48:20, we see how Jacob blessed Ephraim above his older brother Manasseh. Ephraim eventually became ten times more successful than his brother (Deuteronomy 33:17). However, when success came, Ephraim forgot God (Psalms 78:9-11). God kept sending prophets to Ephraim, but he refused to listen to the Blesser. After some time, God said, “Let him alone” (Hosea 4:17). By the time we get to Hosea 5:9, God said that Ephraim would be desolate. Ephraim lost his blessings because he prioritised them above the Blesser. When success comes, don’t forget God because He has the power to give and to take away.<br><br>When I became the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I decided by faith that God would feed everyone that came for our annual convention. One of the young men who was a baker said he would provide the bread for breakfast. He later on changed his mind and decided not to supply us with bread as he had promised because he didn’t like a message I preached. God however, sent help to us and we were able to purchase the bread we required. Years later, my baker friend appeared at my house very early one morning; I said, “What can I do for you? You came very early”. He said he would have come earlier but one of his tires got flat and he didn’t have a spare. This was a man who used to have numerous cars; now, he didn’t even have a spare tire because he placed the blessing above the Blesser. <br><br>Beloved, focus on the Blesser and not the blessing.",

      "The first lesson I want us to learn in today’s devotional reading is that God is delighted in our prosperity and this is why He gave us His commandments.<br><br>Psalms 1:1-3 says: <br><br><b>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</b><br><br>As we progress in this second half of the year, we should take note of the factors that will aid our all-round prosperity. Some people misinterpret or do not know why the rich man in Luke 12:16-21 died the way he did at the peak of his prosperity. It was simply because he did not acknowledge God as the Source of his wealth. He was also so engrossed in acquiring wealth that he did not know when his time was up; hence he did not prepare for eternity (Luke 16:21). His error was not that he became rich because as a matter of fact, God is interested in the prosperity of His children. The Bible says in 3 John 2:<br><br><b>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</b><br><br>The Bible says further that God gives the power to get wealth (Deuteronomy 8:18). The Church also is expected to prosper through all-round growth. For example, Luke 12:1 describes the audience of Jesus as an ‘innumerable multitude of people’ which signifies a huge growth in His ministry. Zechariah 1:17 also says that, through prosperity shall the cities of the Lord be spread abroad.<br><br>The Bible however, also says that the so-called prosperity of sinners shall destroy them (Proverbs 1:32). Beware of ungodly means of getting wealth, so that you can avoid the sorrows that come with ill gotten riches (1 Timothy 6:6-10).",

      "I thank God that He made sure I studied Mathematics before I became a preacher. Every Mathematician knows that for any formula to work, certain conditions must be met. If you meet God’s conditions, He will do for you what He is not doing for others. This is so important that it could be the greatest thing you have ever heard or read in your life, because if you begin to meet His conditions, people around you would begin to ask, “What is your secret?”<br><br>When people sing, “Abraham’s blessings are mine”, many of them think it is just by singing it that they’ll have the blessing. When you do your research, you’ll see that Abraham himself, in Genesis 22:16-17, got his blessing by being willing to sacrifice his only son to God. That day, God swore by Himself to bless Abraham and Isaac also, because the boy was willing to lay down his life. When Isaac was going to pass on the blessing, he gave it to the son who brought him a meal that he loved (Genesis 27:1-29). I agree that when you became a Christian, you received the blessing of Abraham, but to tell you the whole truth, you got it on credit. You must be ready to give something for that blessing to really begin to manifest in your life. Nothing goes for nothing.<br><br>When God saved my soul, with joy I gave Him the first house I ever built - a little mud house plastered with cement. Thereafter, God built another one for me in my little village and when He needed it, I gave it to Him too. I also gave the first house I built in Lagos to God when He needed it. These are just a few of the things that I can tell you here. By the time God responded, He did so in a marvelous way. For example, anywhere I go to now and there’s a member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God there, I can be sure of a good place to sleep that night. If I announce that I need a car for an assignment tomorrow for example, I am likely to wake up the next day to see a fleet of cars brought by different people and each one would want me to pick the one they brought. If you really want God to bless you, you should ask yourself, “Have I met the conditions necessary for me to be blessed?”",

      "After God has called you to salvation, the next call is to join Him in redeeming the world.

For example, He can call some to join Him in the technology field because He wants to use technology as a tool to reach the unsaved.<br><br>His agenda goes beyond the altar into the everyday lives of people. God is not a Sunday-Sunday God. He is God every single day and so He is using people to accomplish His agenda daily. Pastors don’t reserve the right to be used by God. As far as you are born again - whether you are in business, arts and entertainment or even in fashion, God can use you in that field to fulfil His will. He said in Colossians 3:17: <i>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.”</i><br><br>Thus, whatever it is that you do, make sure you are doing it in the name of Jesus Christ. When you do something in the name of someone, it means it is not you but the fellow being represented that’s doing it. In other words, when God calls you to an industry, you are not to go there to do your will but His. His agenda is already set; all He does when He calls you is to join Him in bringing it to pass. Thus, when you feel Him pulling you to work for Him in a certain field of life, then you must ask Him what His agenda is concerning that thing you are to do. Everything you do must be in line with His agenda. You should also note that you are His representative there and you must not do what He Himself wouldn’t.<br><br>As a reward for answering the call to join Him in His redemptive work in the world, God makes sure that all things work together for your good.<br><br><b>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</b><br><br>Romans 8:28<br><br>Once you are called according to His purpose and you answer that call, all things will begin to work together for your good.",

      "The call of God is actually a call to God. It isn’t a call to something but a call to Himself. When He calls you, He is saying, “Come closer to me”. In Mark 3:14, the Bible says that the first reason He called the disciples was that they should be with Him.<br><br>The call of God is two-fold. First, He can call you to leave your sinful ways (Matthew 11:28). This is the very first call that every man will receive. It is a call that brings you close and guarantees an eternity with Him if you answer. Thus, when you hear an altar call, it is God Himself calling you to salvation. If you are still committing sin, this is one call that you should not ignore. You don’t know the final call that God will make for you to come to Him for salvation.<br><br>Many have received God's call to salvation but then, after a while, started to live in sin again. That is not how this call works (Luke 9:62). If you sincerely answer the call to salvation, then holiness would be your lifestyle. If you become saved and then start living a double life where you sin willfully, the Bible says that God would spew you out of His mouth (Revelation 3:16) - in other words, He would reject you completely. 2 Timothy 2:19 says, <i>“Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.

Psalms 16:11 says: <i>“Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”</i><br><br>Our Bible reading for today says that when the Lord turned around the people’s captivity, their mouths were filled with laughter. That is the nature of Light; He brings laughter. Light stands for joy (John 16:24).<br><br>There was this woman whose children were dying so she visited a white garment prophet for a solution. When she got there, the man’s wife gave her a piece of kolanut to eat, claiming that was the solution to her problem. She ate it and at night, found herself in a witchcraft meeting. Before long, she had offered up her husband. After about two years, the other witches asked for one of her children - the very children she wanted to protect. She attended one of our programmes in Ilorin and while I was preaching, I noticed a commotion in the congregation. After the service, the ushers told me that the woman’s dress caught fire during the preaching. We prayed a simple prayer after which she gave her life to Christ and when she went home, she excreted a dead snake. She was free from that day on. Darkness does not give joy, all it has to offer is sorrow. Proverbs 10:22 says it is only the blessings of God that maketh rich and addeth no sorrow.

      "From the story of Bartimaeus, we can see that darkness and stagnation go hand in hand. Bartimaeus must have been on that same spot begging since he became blind. Since stagnation is linked to darkness, this means that light stands for progress and promotion. Psalms 75:6-7 says:<br><br><b>For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.\xa0But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</b><br><br>1 Samuel 2:8 tells us that God can pick up a beggar from a dunghill and keep promoting him until he is standing with princes. If you notice that you seem to have been in the same position for years now, then it is likely that you are in darkness. You need to connect to the Light now, so that you can make real progress.<br><br>Stagnation is primarily caused by forces of darkness. The devil fights progress. That is why when Nehemiah was trying to rebuild the city walls, the devil raised many enemies to stop the work. One fellow was talking to me some years ago; he said, “I don’t know what’s happening; it seems as if my enemies are increasing”. I said, “Tell me a little bit about how things have been with you in the past couple of years”. He said everything had been good; whatever he touched had been prospering. I said, “That is the reason”. There are those who love it when you come to them to beg for food, but the moment you begin to make progress, hatred comes. Darkness does not want you to progress, but thank God light stands for promotion.<br><br>There was a man who had been on one spot for many years. During one of our programmes, God spoke to me and I announced, “There is someone here; somebody close to you will die next week. Don’t be sad because, after the death, your promotion will come”. The following week, his father died, but before the man passed on, he confessed that he had said, “How can my son be greater than I?”, so he decided to use diabolical powers to make the boy stagnant. Almost immediately after the father died, the promotion of the young man began. Anyone sitting on your promotion and refusing to stand will be uprooted by the Almighty God, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Darkness is linked with barrenness. This implies that light is equivalent to fruitfulness. When you study the Scriptures, you will see that God is interested in your fruitfulness. The very first commandment He gave to man is <i>“Be fruitful and multiply”</i> (Genesis 1:28). In Exodus 23:26, the Almighty God said clearly: <i>“There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil”</i>. I am decreeing, that if you are trusting God for the fruit of the womb, you will carry your own twins soon, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There are some cases of barrenness where the doctor cannot see anything wrong with the couple because the devil is at work. A woman’s mother-in-law once visited her house and said, “My daughter, eat this bread and use it to block your womb”. The girl ate it, not taking the woman’s words seriously. From that day, she stopped menstruating for several years. Thank God we held a programme in her town that ran for some days. One afternoon during the programme, she slept and had a dream. In the dream, some people dressed like medical doctors laid her on the table, opened up her belly and began to pull out a rope. The rope was very long, and at the end of the rope was a very black piece of bread. By the time she woke, she saw that the bed was wet with her menstrual flow. The last time I heard from her, she already had 5 children. Whatever darkness has used to stop your fruitfulness - whether it is in child-bearing or otherwise, the Light will deal with it.<br><br>Some people asked me not too long ago, “Why are you against same-sex marriage?” I asked in turn, “How will two men or two women produce a child?” They mentioned adoption, but who is going to produce the child they are going to adopt?

This is however not surprising because darkness also stands for hatred while light represents love. Proverbs 14:20 says the poor is hated even by his own neighbors. Darkness goes hand in hand with poverty and poverty leads to hatred. People can hate you just because you are poor. Thank God light stands for love. Romans 8:37 says we are more than conquerors because of the One who loved us. When you come in contact with The Light, your victory is guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how many people hate you; if Jesus is on your side, you will be a winner.<br><br>You would notice that, when Bartimaeus was crying for help, not a single person encouraged him until the Light of the world called for him. Bartimaeus was a lonely man. There is a direct link between darkness and loneliness. In Psalms 121:5, the Bible says the Lord is your shade upon your right hand. This means God is always with you. If you come in contact with the Light of the world, you can never be lonely again. There are many people who are rich and successful in their endeavours, yet lonely. This is because they have not come in contact with the Light of the world. Bartimaeus’ loneliness ended the day he met Jesus because he instantly became a celebrity and we are still talking about him today.<br><br>Light drives away loneliness while darkness embraces it. Many times, loneliness is a result of works of darkness. It is the Light who made the statement in Genesis 2:18 that it is not good that man should be alone. Years ago, a mother came to me and said she needed help. She had four daughters – the youngest of whom was 28 years old, yet they were all single. As I was about to pray, the Lord told me to ask some questions and I discovered there was a demon in their family who had laid claim to the girls. This demon was the one preventing them from getting married. We prayed and God gave us victory over the evil covenant. Within a year, all four of them were married.

Any situation that involves begging to eat is called poverty. The Almighty God’s plan is not for you to be a beggar, but rather that you would prosper. For several years, the enemy kept the Church in darkness and pastors began to equate holiness with poverty. The devil knows that you can spread the gospel faster if you have money. I don’t know about you, but in the name of Jesus Christ, I am going to prosper because light stands for prosperity. <br><br>Darkness works to make you poor, but it is the duty of the Light to make you rich. 2 Corinthians 8:9 says clearly:<br><br><b>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</b><br><br>He became poor that you, through His poverty, might become rich. If you are truly a child of God, carrying the Light of the Almighty within you, I have good news for you: all those who have been saying that you are going to die poor shall be disappointed. 3 John 2 says He wishes above all things that you would prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.

      "John 3:1-2 tells us clearly that Jesus was a teacher. It may amaze you that throughout His ministry on earth, nobody ever called Him Evangelist or Prophet or Pastor; they kept calling Him ‘Teacher’. Everywhere Jesus went, He went teaching, including by the seaside (Mark 2:13).<br><br>Jesus is a teacher and likes to relate with us as such; this is good news because the teacher is held responsible for the success or failure of a student. If the teacher can then prove that the student failed because he or she refused to obey instructions, then the teacher is relieved of that responsibility. You see this clearly when Jesus gave His report at the end of His time on earth in John 17:12. He said: <i>“While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</i>”<br><br>Thus if you listen to all Jesus’ instructions and obey Him, He will definitely help you make it to heaven at the end of time.<br><br>After Jesus resurrected from the dead, His role advanced from teacher to Teacher of teachers. This is why, in John 20:16, Mary Magdalene called Him ‘Rabboni’, a special title used to honour great teachers. For those of us who are teachers of the gospel, James 3:1 says that we would receive greater condemnation on the last day if our works are found wanting. Of course, this is because such people are responsible for the souls of men that the Almighty God allocates to them. The good news however, is that we have a Teacher who will teach us how to pass this great test on the last day. He is always there to teach you how to succeed in whatever assignment He commits into your hands. That is why I have always told my children not to get so busy with ministry that they lose connection with the Teacher of teachers. Believe me honestly, without Him, you cannot do ministry right. You cannot be snatching souls from the devil’s kingdom and expect him to be soft on you. He will deploy many tactics to bring you down, but if you remain connected to the Teacher of teachers, you will win in the end.<br><br>Stay connected to the Teacher of teachers. ",

      "In our Bible reading for today, God asked Elijah the same question twice: <i>“What doest thou here, Elijah?”</i> God is not talkative; if He asks the same question twice, there must be a reason behind it. Usually, when God asks you a question, it is a test. In John 6:5-7, when Jesus saw the crowd, He turned and asked one of the disciples where they would find food to feed the people. The Bible added that the question was to test him, for He already knew what He would do. The teacher knows the answer; He only tests the student when He asks a question.<br><br>In Genesis 3:1-7, when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and hid behind a tree, God had already seen them. Yet He asked, <i>“Adam, where art thou?”</i> When Adam said “We heard Your voice and were afraid because we were naked”. He asked further, “Who told you that you’re naked?” He knew already, but still He asked to see what they would say. Unfortunately, they were pushing the blame and so they got the punishment they deserved. In Genesis 4:3-10, God asked Cain where Abel was. When Cain said he didn’t know, God responded, “His blood is crying to me from where you killed and buried him”. God knew where Abel was from the onset, yet He asked Cain where he was and sadly, Cain never told the truth.<br><br>When God asks you a question, especially concerning a sin that you committed, fall on your face and beg for mercy. That question is a test to see if you are really repentant or not. If, on the other hand, He asks you a question that is not pertaining to a sin you committed, my advice is that you ask the Holy Spirit to help you answer.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, God asked Elijah the same question twice and he gave the same answer both times. I believe God asked the second time because He had hoped Elijah would answer differently. I feel that if Elijah had not answered the questions with frustration, he wouldn’t have been asked to anoint his replacement yet. In Ezekiel 37:3, Ezekiel was wise. God asked Him, “Can these bones live?” He did not know how to answer, so he responded, “You know, Lord”. God’s questions are tests; ask the Holy Spirit to help you answer them when they come.",

John asked and Jesus responded in a whisper that only John could hear.<br><br>In one of our Holy Ghost Services, God said, “All my sheep hear my voice, but very few hear my whisper”. There is a difference between when God speaks and when He whispers. When you hear God’s whisper, you will be several steps ahead of your colleagues. You will become number one in whatever you have set out to do. I pray that you will begin to hear God’s whisper from today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>To hear God’s whisper, you must be closer to Him than everyone else. Before John heard Jesus’ whisper, the Bible tells us in John 13:25 the position he took: <i>“He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?”</i><br><br>You cannot be closer to a person than the fellow lying on his or her chest. That is the position that you must take. You must get so close to God that you can practically hear His heartbeat. Only a few people are as close to God as this and you will see that they are addicted soul-winners because God’s heart beats for the souls of men.<br><br>The good thing is that God is willing to bring you very close to Him. He said in James 4:8:<br><br><b>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</b><br><br>The question however is, are you willing to draw near to Him and if so, how closely? Every time you sin, a distance is created between you and God (Isaiah 59:1-2, Psalms 66:18). The first thing you therefore need to do to get close enough to God to hear His whisper is to be holy. Once you are holy, God will begin to tell you things that are for your ears only. Do you want to hear God’s whispers and become a custodian of divine secrets?

      "Several years ago, when I was a very young preacher, there was a good campground in Nigeria called the ‘Youth Camp’. We would often go there for retreats. One day while we were there for a retreat, the owners told me they wanted to sell the place for N100,000. We had nothing close to that kind of money then, but I had faith that God would buy the place for us. I gathered my people together and we prayed round the camp, confessing that it was already ours in line with the word of God in Joshua 1:3 - <i>“Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you”</i>. Later on, when the owners saw that we were not forthcoming with the money, they sold it to a bigger ministry. We were devastated. We turned to God, “But Lord, we prayed, we used Your word”. All through, He remained silent. He remained silent because He had something bigger in store for us. He knew that forty acres of land would be too small for where He was taking us. By God’s grace, the auditorium we now call the Old Auditorium sits on over forty acres of land. Our new auditorium is now 3 kilometres by 3 kilometres.<br><br>If you have prayed, praised God, and are sure of your faith, but God remains silent, it is likely because He has something bigger in store for you than what you are asking for. He is a God who takes pleasure in exceeding His children’s expectations. The Bible says in Ephesians 3:20: <i>“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,”</i><br><br>In our Bible reading for today, the man at the pool of Bethesda was explaining his predicament to Jesus, hoping that He would help him get into the water.

Don’t give up hope; trust Him. Isaiah 55:8-9 says:<br><br><b>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the\xa0Lord. 9\xa0For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</b>",

What would I be saying? The Lord then let me know that the only way I could pray without ceasing was to do so in the Spirit. This implies that God expects every believer to pray in the Spirit all day.<br><br>Believe me honestly, you don’t know all you truly need. Even if you argue that you know all that you need at this moment, do you know what will happen in the next two hours? If you don’t know what will happen, then, how will you pray about it? That is why you have the Holy Spirit to pray those prayers through you. You ask for what you want with your words; the Holy Spirit will help you ask for what you ought to have when you pray in tongues. Without the Holy Spirit, you cannot pray correctly. Romans 8:26 affirms this:<br><br><b>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</b><br><br>Ephesians 5:18 says further:<br><br><b>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.</b><br><br>Alcoholics will tell you that they are always craving more and more alcohol. That is how you should become addicted to praying in the Spirit. The more you pray in the Spirit, the more filled you would be. You would realise that it is difficult to stop praying sometimes. As you pray, you get more and more engulfed in the Spirit and before you know it, everything you do would be influenced by Him. Galatians 5:17 says that the flesh and the Spirit are always at war. The more you pray in the Spirit, the more energized your spirit man would be to win that war against the flesh, so it becomes easy to put it under (1 Corinthians 9:27).

      "The greatest benefit of intercession is that God draws you closer to Himself. He tells you His next move because He needs you to intercede concerning it. When you are an intercessor, you get so close to God that you feel His heartbeat. You share in His very burden for the souls of men. God sees intercessors just like He sees Jesus because He is the number one intercessor. 1 John 2:1 says He is always with the Father, advocating for us. Intercessors carry a strong burden for the souls of men, just like Jesus did when He laid down His life for mankind. Moses - a true intercessor, illustrated how much he carried this burden in Exodus 32:31-32:<br><br>\xa0<b>And Moses returned unto the\xa0 Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 32\xa0Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</b><br><br>He asked God to forgive the people of Israel or remove his name from the book of life. That is how much the burden of the souls of men is on intercessors. That is why intercessors are in the same department as Jesus Christ. Jesus is their Head of Department and whatever prayer comes from that department is seen by God as coming from Jesus Christ Himself.<br><br>Solomon cared about the people of God more than he did about himself. That is why, when he only asked for wisdom to lead the people right, God decided to bless him far beyond his expectations. Intercessors hardly have personal prayer points because before their needs arise, God has already resolved them.<br><br>Real intercessors don’t intercede just for their own benefit. Intercession is borne out of love and passion for the souls of men. Like Daniel in Daniel 9:1-19, when an intercessor sees the promise of God not being fulfilled in the life of a person or nation, he or she would begin to pray concerning that situation. He or she would keep reminding God of that promise until it is fulfilled, just to ensure that God’s will is established and that the souls of men are preserved from danger.",

      "God doesn’t only need intercessors; He only needs people who will pray for others, He also needs people to enforce His will on earth. For example, when elections are coming up in your state or country, you and other Christians in that vicinity should come together and pray fervently that only the will of God would stand. You must pray these kinds of prayers not only during elections but all the time. The Lord said in Isaiah 62:1: <i>“For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.”</i><br><br>When you hear of or know someone working especially hard for the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth, you should begin to pray for that fellow. Your prayer and fasting for that person will be very instrumental in their success and you will also be a part of that success. In Esther 4:15-17, when Esther was going to turn around the evil policy that sought to kill the Israelites, she asked that everyone on her team should fast and pray for her. That is why she received so much favour from the king, so that he quickly ordered the death of his well-trusted right-hand man who had generated the said evil policy.<br><br>We need to pray for our leaders. They may not tell you, but they face a lot of battles from the devil and need your prayers to win these battles. Pastors are included in this group; you must pray for pastors and ministers of the gospel if you want the Kingdom of God to continue to win against the devil.<br><br>Lastly, Matthew 5:44 says you should pray for people who despise and persecute you:<br><br><b>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</b><br><br>Can you pray for people who are about to kill you? That is what Stephen did in Acts 7:60 and we see the result in Acts 8:1-8 when Jesus came Himself to witness to Saul, who later became one of the greatest Apostles of his time.

He looks for a man to stand in the gap for others.<br><br><b>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</b><br><br>Ezekiel 22:30<br><br>Remember when God was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 18 - it was clear that God was looking for someone to stand in the gap for the people of Sodom. You will see that God agreed to every plea Abraham made for the people. God always looks for someone to stand in the gap for others; when He looks your way, will He find you to be an intercessor?<br><br>You may ask, “Why can’t God just reveal to the fellow who is about to get into trouble so he can pray for himself?” The truth is, sometimes, God needs someone else to pray for other people, so they are not destroyed. At such times, He puts it in the heart of an intercessor to stand in the gap in prayers. This is clearly illustrated in the case of Job and his friends (Job 42:8).<br><br>Many people are perishing today because there is a shortage of intercessors willing to carry the burdens of God in the place of prayer. Enough of praying for yourself alone. Don’t be a selfish Christian. When you pray, let God put into your heart what or who you should pray for. If He lays in your heart to pray for another country that is not yours, don’t say, “What is my business with those people?” Pray as He has laid in your heart so that at least one person there can be saved. Sometimes He will ask you to pray for one fellow; do so, because your prayer may be what would make the difference between the fellow living or dying. God is seeking intercessors; will He find you?",

After this, you seek to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and invite Him to dwell in you and take control of your life.<br><br>Once the above steps are taken, you must begin to do less of the things your flesh wants you to do. Don’t let your flesh control you. You cannot be spending all your free time on social media, attending parties, or eating as often as you like. If you give your flesh everything it asks for, you will remain under its control and this can only lead to eternal damnation. Paul said in Acts 17:28 that it is in Jesus that we believers live, move and have our being. That must be your testimony too. You also need the Holy Spirit to keep the flesh under control. You are not strong enough to deal with the flesh by yourself (Romans 8:13).<br><br>To continue to grow your spiritual capacity, you must truly pray without ceasing, as 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says. If you are not willing to pray consistently and fervently at all times, you are not yet willing to increase your spiritual capacity. When you cannot pray in understanding, switch to praying in the Spirit. Fasting and studying the word of God daily must also become your lifestyle (Jeremiah 15:16). You must also seek to hear God at all times.

However, if you come to Him telling Him how you plan to advance His kingdom here on earth with the miracle you are asking for, He will pay attention to you. Hannah understood this principle, so she prayed thus:<br><br><b>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord\xa0of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the \xa0Lord\xa0 all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</b> <br>1 Samuel 1:11<br><br>God granted her request by giving her a son who grew to become a great prophet and then gave her five more children.<br><br>Seek to glorify God first and you will see Him giving you more than you asked for. He knew your needs before you came to Him (Matthew 6:8); so, give Him an offer He cannot refuse, and you will see Him supplying your needs in abundance.<br><br>You may say, “God loves me, and I believe He will give me whatever I want”. No doubt, He loves you, but He has a purpose for everything He does. You may have thought that God drowned Pharaoh in the Red Sea just because He loves the Israelites, but Romans 9:17 says:<br><br><b>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</b><br><br>The real reason God destroyed Pharaoh was to declare His glory and majesty throughout the earth. God’s agenda is always superior to ours; if you align your agenda with His, then you will get what you want.",

I can never forget my final year in grammar school. Prize-Giving day was coming up and I was supposed to take home many prizes. Those of us in our final year were to wear white trousers and shoes but I had no trousers – white, black or red. As for shoes, I had never owned one. I started lamenting, “God, you know I have no trousers; why did You allow me to win these prizes?” One day, a boy in the hostel asked me to help him choose which of his six trousers he should wear for the ceremony. I helped him choose one and then said, “Ermm, you know I don’t even have one to wear”. “Pick one,” he offered. Although the trouser was so big that I nearly had to pull the waistband up to my chest, I didn’t care; trousers were trousers.<br><br>Now, the next problem was shoes. It was then I remembered that I had a poor uncle somewhere who had some shoes. The pair he gave me was old, with soles made from old lorry tires. I had to practice walking in them because I had never worn shoes before in my life. However, when the Prize-Giving day finally came, I had trousers and shoes to wear to the occasion. Even if your current situation is worse than what I have just described, I assure you that the Lord who lifted me up can do the same for you. Greater days are coming, if you trust God and lay all in His hands. I must say that God did not raise me just because He felt like doing so; He did it to show forth His own glory. He said when your light shines before men, it is so that they can glorify your Father in heaven (Matthew 5:16).<br><br>If you dedicate your life to glorifying Him and are never shy to give Him glory for whatever you achieve, He will raise you, even higher than you can ever imagine.<br><br>Greater days are ahead of you, in Jesus’ name.",

      "What is leading you in life? Is it your flesh or the Spirit of God? Whenever you allow the flesh to give you direction, it will always end in regret, but when you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in all things, you can be sure that all will be well. The first step to overcoming lusts and temptations is submission to God, which supplies the power you need to resist the devil, and he will flee from you according to James 4:7. Moreover, the good news is that the faithfulness of God will not allow His children to be tempted above their ability, without making a way of escape for them.<br><br>In our Bible reading today, we saw that God will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear and He will always make a way of escape for us. That is so reassuring. It is for this reason that James 1:2-4, and James 1:12, admonishes us to count it as joy and a blessing, when we are going through diverse temptations. This is because God uses it to perfect the patience of His children, and also as promotion exams for them to receive the crown of life.<br><br>In spite of the assurance above however, if for example, your eyes are always glued to seductive images on the television, the internet, and your surroundings, you are merely feeding the lust in your flesh and such will lead you to hell. Don’t fall into it. If you still tolerate ungodly desires to dwell and grow in your heart, heavenly thoughts, divine visions and inspirations cannot find expression in you.<br><br>All believers are required to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God. Your body is the temple of God, not a showpiece for people. If you choose to dress in a way to stir lust from the opposite sex, you can no longer claim to be a child of God, but an instrument in the hand of the devil. Whoever you honour with your appearance, determines who you truly serve. God has provided us with everything we need to overcome lusts and temptations through Jesus Christ, all we need is to follow His example. Hebrews 4:15 says Jesus our High Priest was in all points tempted, but He scaled over them all without a sin. He has given us the power to resist the devil and to live above lusts and temptations.

      "Temptation is the pressure to yield to influences that can lead people away from God and into sin. The Bible makes it clear that all human beings are subject to temptation, but the outcome often depends on the person’s state of mind and loyalty to God. On the other hand, lust is an inordinate and compulsive desire for sex, food, riches or power. Lust is natural to unbelievers (2 Peter 2:14-18) but Christians must fight against it by showing self-control (Galatians 5:16-21). The Bible condemns lust and describes it as an abomination to God. A classic example of an inappropriate desire is one that led Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:6). <br><br>Lust and temptation are like tag team champions - they work together so well that it is often difficult to differentiate them. The desire for position or superiority, if not moderated by the Holy Spirit, may translate to an inappropriate quest for power, which has turned some to murderers. Some politicians do this with impunity and when the judgment of God later descends on them, they would say it is the handiwork of the devil.\xa0At first, David only desired to have a taste of Bathsheba - the wife of Uriah, but it ended up in the murder of her husband, which then brought a divine curse on David’s lineage.<br><br>Beloved, what are you lusting after? Repent today because it would have a sour and bitter end - sin and death. James 1:13-15 says, <i>“Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:\xa0But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.\xa0Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” </i><br><br>The above Bible passage reveals fundamental truths about lust and temptation.\xa0God is not responsible for human temptation. Temptation becomes activated in an individual when he or she is drawn by an inner lust and thus becomes enticed. Thereafter, lust would produce sin, which eventually leads to death. I pray for you today: you will not become an abandoned project or die before your time, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Blood is not just important in the life of man, but also very sacred in the sight of our creator – the Almighty God. It is so sacred that the Bible says anyone who sheds blood will have his or her blood shed also (Genesis 9:6). The first place where we saw God being angry with someone who shed the blood of another fellow is in Genesis 4, in the case of the murder of Abel by his brother Cain. The Almighty God said:<br><br><b>What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.</b><br>Genesis 4:10-11<br><br>The sacredness of blood can be further seen in our memory verse. The life of the flesh is in blood and that is why the blood of Jesus can make atonement for our sins and redeem us from eternal damnation that awaits all sinners.<br><br>Many people have however, shown complete disregard for the sacredness of blood. Many engage in or encourage abortion of unwanted pregnancies, ritual killings, cannibalism and so on. Some have told lies that led to others losing their lives. Some embezzled funds that should have been used to build roads or hospitals thereby causing fatal road accidents and loss of lives due to poor medical services as a result of inadequate funding. Criminals shed blood with impunity without considering the position of the Almighty God concerning such acts.<br><br>Beloved, are you blood-guilty? You must repent today because blood is very sacred and God will not spare unrepentant sinners who are caught in the guilt of blood-letting. The good news is that Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, has paid for all our sins, including blood-guiltiness, as we find in our Bible reading of today. The moment a person acknowledges that Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose that we may have eternal life, that fellow is saved from every sin, including blood-guiltiness of the past.<br><br>Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour, and your sins will be completely forgiven.

      "Yesterday, we discussed three ways we can seek God, namely – through His word, with all of our hearts and by obeying His will. Today, we shall continue to look at how we can seek God and the blessings that come to those who seek Him. We can effectively seek and find God by faith. Hebrews 11:6 says:<br><br><b>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</b><br><br>It takes faith to find God because He is a Spirit. He is invisible to the physical eyes and can only be worshipped genuinely in spirit and in truth (John 4:23). The Bible says something very profound about the life of the children of Israel – <i>“He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel”</i> (Psalms 103:7). The implication of this is that while Moses knew the ways of God, the children of Israel went along with Him through the miracles they saw God performing. Therefore, Moses was deep in God, but the children of Israel were shallow and easily tossed here and there by the challenges they faced on their way to the promised land. Moses believed in God and took Him by His word; the children of Israel lived by what they saw. This is why they responded negatively to situations they encountered in the wilderness. They refused to see God in all those experiences. Moreover, seekers of God go the extra mile to get to Him. In our Bible text for today, we read about the Greeks who believed in the Messianic message. They came to see and have an encounter with Jesus. <br><br>Beloved, who are you seeking in the Church - the Pastor, the choristers, who? I congratulate you if you are a seeker of God through Jesus Christ. God seekers are never put to shame. The Bible speaks of those who seek God as being protected from shame. <i>“They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied”<i/> (Psalms 37:19). <br><br>As we navigate through this second half of year 2023, seek the Lord earnestly and you shall find Him mighty to save, mighty to bless and mighty to keep you alive.",

People do not seek God today - not because they are ignorant of what they stand to gain seeking the One from whom all blessings flow. Rather, they are not comfortable with His demands on what they consider as their right to decide how to live their lives. The elders say, “A child born yesterday who threatens not to play with us should be asked, ‘Do you think we were lonely before your birth?’” In other words, if we do not seek God’s face, its to our disadvantage and not God’s.<br><br>David, in our Bible reading, gave his reason for seeking God when he said: <i>“For I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.” He said further, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth”</i> (Psalms 121:1-2). Beloved, it pays to seek the Lord. Isaiah 55:6 encourages us to do so when He may be found and before it is too late.

Our memory verse says:<br><br><b>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.</b><br>Psalms 33:18<br><br>The Scripture above reveals a very huge blessing that comes from fearing God. The blessing is that the eye of the Lord will be upon everyone that fears God. This revelation implies several great things amongst which is that when the eye of the Lord is upon an individual, safety is guaranteed. Hebrews 11:6 says that God is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. The Bible further says: <i>“The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good”</i> (Proverbs 15:3). In other words, the eye of the Lord sees everything – even the plans and moves of the wicked who want to harm you and He knows how to deal with them.<br><br>In today’s Bible text we are enjoined to fear the Lord above all gods because they are ordinary works of men (Psalms 96:4-5). We should also note that some people have made human beings their gods - probably for fear of what these people could do to them. Psalms 56:11 however, says: <i>“In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me”.</i> Psalms 118:6 says also, <i>“The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?”</i> Our Lord Jesus Christ taught us to fear God and not man (Matthew 10:28).<br><br>Another demonstration of the fear of the Lord is in verse nine of our text: <i>“O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.”</i> There is no true worship of God without holiness. This is where those who overstretch grace miss it. Obedience is synonymous with holiness and the Scripture says to obey is better than sacrifice (1 Samuel 15:22). Therefore, we must watch out for our worship - whether it is premised on the fear of the Lord or mere hypocrisy.

The Lord asks: “<i>A son honoureth his Father and a servant his master: if then i be a father, where is my honor?</i>” (Malachi 1:6). How do we fear the Lord? today’s bible reading gives us ideas on how we fear the most high God. 1, we must magnify the Lord for who He is. It takes the appreciation of God to fear Him. The Psalmist says: <br><br><b>Oh Lord our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the Earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens... when i consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.</b> <br>Psalms 8:1,3<br><br>Secondly, we must put our total trust in him. Lack of trsyt in God may cause us to disobey him like Adam and Eve did. They repeated what God had told them but the serpent countered it, thereby calling God a liar. Genesis 3:4-5 says, <i>“And the Serpent said unto the Woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”</i> if Adam and Eve had the fear of God in them, the devil would not have had his way in their lives. Here we can see that, indeed, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom(Proverbs 9:10)<br><br>Joseph is a classic example of someone who demonstrated the fear of God. due his fear of the Lord, he refuse to take advantage of the adulterous offer of his master's wife.

In today’s text, we read that though God spoke to His people through His prophets, now He speaks through His Son, Jesus Christ. This is made possible through the Holy Spirit whom Jesus sent to the Church right from the day of Pentecost. He promised:<br><br><b>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</b><br>John 14:26<br><br>God still speaks to His people; no doubt about that. We must however, pay close attention to the later part of the sentence – “to His people.” In other words, God speaks only to His people. Why only His people? It is because it is His people who hearken and act on His words. God has no time to waste talking to those who will not do His bidding. This is why Jesus Christ was fond of speaking to His disciples, whom He knew would abide by His words. He said further:<br><br><b>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</b><br>John 14:21 <br><br>Beloved, there are a lot of blessings for those who hear from God. One of these blessings is that such people would avoid mistakes. For example, the word of God to the people in Cornelius’ household was based on Peter’s ability to hear from God and his obedience to the instructions given to him (Acts 10). In the same vein, Philip’s ability to hear from God took him to the Gazan desert where he gained the soul of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-39).<br><br>For example, hearing from God can reveal the type of business you can do to prosper.

The painful thing is that people do not know what they are missing by not listening to their Maker. In today’s text, we read about Abraham’s encounter with the Almighty God.<br><br><b>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee.</b><br>Genesis 12:1<br><br>There are some lessons we can learn from this singular encounter that changed Abraham’s life. One, God discovered the love and sincerity of Abraham so He revealed Himself to him. This love for God was demonstrated in his positive and prompt response to God’s command to leave his father’s house. Another lesson is that the dialogue between God and Abraham did not contain commands alone; it was backed by eternal blessings. The Bible says, <i>“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”</i> (Romans 10:17). Abraham became the father of faith because the word of God penetrated his heart. In the Scripture from where we took the memory verse, we read of the encounter of Solomon with the Almighty God. During that divine encounter, God gave Solomon a blank cheque and this is a typical privilege enjoyed by those who have such dialogues with God.<br><br><b>In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</b><br>1 Kings 3:5<br><br>To be genuine children of God, we must surrender completely to all His commandments.

This Scripture implies that not all people we find in Church know God or can be trusted. The early Church leaders did not take the issue of love lightly because they knew godliness is tested by the amount of love a believer possesses. Paul the Apostle prayed thus:<br><br><b>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</b><br>1 Thessalonians 3:12-13<br><br>It takes love to be godly because God is love. This love made Him give up His only begotten Son as a sacrifice for us so that we would not perish (John 3:16 and 1 John 4:9). This is the standard that the Almighty God has set for those who claim to be His children. Love makes people go the extra mile in helping others. Jesus commended the good Samaritan in Luke 10:33-37 because the proof of God in us is doing good. Our Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated this as recorded in Acts 10:38:<br><br><b>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</b><br><br>James the Apostle described love in practical terms when he wrote: <i>“Yea, a man may say Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works”</i> (James 2:18). The proof of godliness is service to humanity, according to 2 Timothy 2:21.

      "One great proof of godliness is seen in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, who sacrificed His life for us in love. He expressly commands us to love, according to John 13:34-35:<br><br><b>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</b><br><br>By the rate at which hatred is growing among some self-professing believers, we can ask, “Where is the fulfilment of this commandment?” There could be many reasons for this unpleasant development in the Body of Christ. One is the loss of focus on heaven - where we all aspire to spend eternity. Related to that is the love for this present age. When a person begins to feel jealousy towards another, hatred develops and before long, godliness is thrown to the wind. In our memory verse taken from the main text, John - the Apostle of love, wrote:<br><br><b>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</b><br>1John4:7.<br><br>The above Scripture shows the importance of love among brethren. Beloved, are you living in love? Remember, if you are not living in love, you are in death, according to 1 John 3:14, which says:<br><br><b>We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</b><br><br>Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13:4-6: <br><br><b>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth</b><br><br>Be sure to remove hatred from your heart today, if you do not want all your Christian service to be in vain on the last day.

      "Anyone can become the best. There are however, conditions that must be fulfilled if you want to become the best. The Bible says: <i>“I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth”</i> (Ecclesiastes 10:7). It all depends on the readiness to pay the price. In our Bible text, we read the promises of God that assure us of being the best. However, in the same text, we read the conditions to fulfil – hearkening to the voice of the Lord, observing and doing all His commandments.<br><br>How many of us are ready to hearken to the voice of the Lord today? I have taught my ministers what it means to hearken, which is different from listening. To hearken is not just to listen but to pay very close attention to the details of the voice and commandment of the Lord. Only then can you fulfil the details of God’s instructions. The Bible says that faith can only come by hearing, and hearing by the word of God and not the word of men or the voice of our carnal body (Romans 10:17). For example, if you want to be the best financially, you must pay close attention to Malachi 3:10, which says:<br><br><b>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</b><br><br>A closer look at the passage above will reveal why some people have been paying their tithes but have not received the promise of super-abundance. “Bring all the tithes” the Bible says - not some. “Bring it” not “Send it” – meaning that God cherishes our presence before Him more than our gift. He wants our fellowship. He is not a beggar; we must come with fear and trembling, praying that He would even accept our tithes and offerings.<br><br>Another example is when we want God to perform miracles through us. The Bible says that some results cannot be achieved without prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21), even though some translations have removed fasting for reasons best known to them. Beloved, you can be the best if you will pay the price of surrendering your life to Christ and living according to His will.",

There was a widow who was left with only one son. The storm of death had taken away her husband and returned to take her only son as well. As the child was being carried away for burial, the woman and the people bearing the corpse encountered the Storm Stiller.

The Bible says:<br><br><b>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil: And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</b><br>Hebrews 2:14-15<br><br>Beloved, you do not need to be afraid of death because Jesus Christ has conquered death for us; because He lives, death shall have no power over us again.

The Scripture further says: <i>“The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty”</i> (Proverbs 10:15). The first thing to do to still a financial storm is to work hard. The Bible says:<br><br><b>He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.

      "What is a storm? Literally, a storm is a disturbance of the atmosphere marked by wind and some or a combination of the following: rain, snow, hail, sleet, or thunder and lightning. Figuratively however, a storm is a set of unpleasant circumstances that could result in some loss or the other. Storms of life are in categories. They could be physical, spiritual, emotional, financial, material, political etc.<br><br>In our text, we read about the rising of a great storm that could have capsised the boat Jesus and His disciples were sailing in. The Storm Stiller however, commanded that the storm should be still and it was so. Today, we shall look at physical storms in terms of ill-health. I pray that any storm of ill-health you may be battling is stilled now, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>In the story behind our memory verse of today, there was a man who suffered ill-health for thirty-eight years. His physical storm raged so long that he felt he was to die by the pool of Bethesda. However, on that very day that he encountered the Storm Stiller, his story changed. Jesus Christ – the Storm Stiller asked him: <i>“Wilt thou be made whole?” (John 5:6).</i><br><br>The Almighty God is asking you today, “Do you want to be healed?” If your answer is “Yes,” then you must fulfil the condition for healing. Divine healing is the ‘food’ meant for children according to Matthew 15:26. Therefore, you must be sure you are genuinely born again because your sins must be forgiven before you can enjoy this divine blessing that will still your storm of ill-health. When Jesus Christ wanted to still the storm of the young man that was suffering terribly from palsy, the Bible says:<br><br><b>And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy: Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</b><br>Matthew 9:2<br><br>This implies that you should repent of your sins and seek God’s forgiveness if you want Him to still the storm of ill health in your life. As you heed His call today, every storm of ill health in your life will cease today, in Jesus’ name. ",

      "Our memory verse of today reveals another very important role of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer – preserving us unto the day of redemption. ‘The day of redemption’ in the memory verse is talking of the ultimate redemption when we safely arrive in the Kingdom of God. The reason is that there is no eternal assurance that once you are saved, you are forever saved. There are examples of people who started well but ended badly. For instance, after King Saul was ordained by Samuel, he prophesied and the people asked: <i>“Is Saul also among the prophets?”</i> (1 Samuel 10:11). Unfortunately, after King Saul got into trouble for disobeying divine instructions, he went after a familiar spirit. 1 Samuel 28:7 says:<br><br><b>Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</b><br><br>King Saul did this despite the fact that the Bible says in Isaiah 65:24:<br><br><b>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</b><br><br>In John 16:7-14, we see that the Holy Spirit guides us into all - not some - truth. Many things we ought to know about God, our Saviour, ourselves, the written word of God, the devil, and the world in which we live and so on are explained to us by the Holy Spirit. We cannot gain an understanding of God without the Holy Spirit. The word of God would be ordinary literature without the Holy Spirit’s illumination.<br><br>The Bible says in John 16:13 that the Holy Spirit will show us things to come.<br><br>The spiritual decadence in the end-time Church has been foretold by the Holy Spirit (1 Timothy 4:1-2). It is a pity, however, that some children of God are not taking advantage of the Holy Spirit’s guidance to keep us from falling. May you not fall, in Jesus’ name. ",

Today we want to look at how the Holy Spirit helps believers pray.<br><br>When the Bible says that we should pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17), how can this be possible, humanly speaking? Clearly, this can only be possible with the help of the Holy Spirit. This is why I pity those who deny the baptism of the Holy Spirit as promised by our Lord Jesus Christ in Acts 1:8.<br><br>Our Lord Jesus Christ gave a parable to teach us how important ceaseless prayer is to us as believers in Luke 18:1-8. However, without the help of the Holy Spirit, no one can accomplish this.<br><br>Naturally, we do not even know what to pray for but the Holy Spirit guides us and prays the will of God through us. Romans 8:26 says:<br><br>\xa0<b>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</b><br><br>From the scripture above, we see that we need the Holy Spirit to help us to pray the right way.<br><br>The Holy Spirit also reminds us of the significance of giving thanks as we pray. Indeed, our thanksgiving, praise and worship should always exceed our requests. Philippians 4:6 says:<br><br><b>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God.</b><br><br>These indeed are keys to get our prayers answered hence all Christians must seek to be baptised in the Holy Spirit.

It reads in part:<br><br><b>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.</b><br>John 16:8 <br><br>Unfortunately, many people choose to be just spectators and merely watch the Holy Spirit in action – doing what only He can do, but are never partakers of it. Such people seldom allow the Holy Spirit to play His primary role of bringing them to repentance as they refuse to be remorseful for their sins. When people refuse to be convicted of their sins, they demonstrate a lack of faith in God’s word, which says all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23). Such people rationalize sin and call it all sorts of nice names. This is why the Bible encourages us to confess our sins, even to one another, that we may be healed (James 5:16).<br><br>The first thing Jesus takes care of in the life of whoever He wants to heal is the issue of sin, according to Mark 2:5-12.

At such times, the person is left with the option of calling for divine intervention through desperate prayers to the Almighty God. I pray that as you call on the name of the Lord in the day of trouble, He will answer you by fire, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>If you want your prayers to be answered however, you have a responsibility to the poor and needy around you.

When was the last time you helped the needy around you? When was the last time you made sacrifices in order to meet the needs of other people?

Our Lord Jesus described how His followers who feed the hungry, are hospitable to strangers, clothe the naked, care for the sick, and visit prisoners will be blessed by God and granted eternal life. He went further to say that in as much as these good deeds are done to any of His brethren, it is considered that the acts were done to Him directly and vice versa.<br><br>All believers and the Church as a whole must not leave the poor and needy at the mercy of the government.

For example, when the children of Israel found themselves in slavery, they cried to the God of their fathers.<br><br><b>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</b><br>Exodus 3:9.<br><br>In response to their cry, there was a divine intervention which delivered them from slavery to King Pharaoh (Exodus 6:6). This type of situation is not peculiar to the children of Israel alone; people have been subjected to serious attacks, frustration and untold hardship from generation to generation. The reason is found in the book of Revelation - how the devil came to the world in a great fury to wreak havoc on earth’s inhabitants (Revelation 12:12). Unless God intervenes as He did in Genesis, human life can be extremely miserable. In today’s text, three kings ganged up against the tribe of Judah. Jehoshaphat - the King of Judah, however, cried to the Lord for divine intervention, knowing that there was no way he could win the battle against just one of the three kings, not to mention the joint forces of all three. The Lord responded and said:<br><br><b>Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the Lord will be with you.</b><br><br>2 Chronicles 20:17<br><br>The Lord intervened and the battle was decided in favour of King Jehoshaphat and his people.

      "Our Lord Jesus Christ is the power and wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:24). He declared in Luke 4:18: <br><br><b>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.</b><br>Luke 4:18 <br><br>It then follows that anyone who embraces the gospel of Jesus Christ is wise. However, the word of God cannot be understood through logical reasoning. For instance, Jesus preached that whoever will have his life must first lose it for His sake (Mark 8:35). He also declared that for us to find rest for our souls, we must take His yoke upon us. How can yoke-carrying bring rest to the soul of the carrier? This is why many scientists and philosophers struggle to accept and believe the word of God. For example, I was personally caught in this web in my early Christian walk concerning tithing. “How can 90% be enough when even the entire 100% was never enough for me?” I queried then. Thanks be to God that I know better now.<br><br>The good news is that Acts 10:38 testifies that Jesus Christ went about preaching and His preaching brought all forms of deliverance to those who listened and came to Him (Matthew 21:14).<br><br>Beloved, do you believe the Gospel? The Gospel is the good news of how Jesus came to this world to save all sinners (1 Timothy 1:15). This is the wisdom of God hidden in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Come to Him today to receive His Wisdom and your life will not remain the same.<br><br>What are your needs? He has promised that if you seek His kingdom and righteousness first, He will add all these things you need to you (Matthew 6:33).

For anyone to have the hope of glory, the fellow must choose correctly whom he or she would serve (Joshua 24:15). It takes faith to choose rightly, according to our memory verse for today.<br><br>Through faith in the Living God, we are justified as the redeemed of the Lord – Jesus being the Author and Finisher of our Faith. He came to save us through His death, by the washing away of our sins with His blood. This is why the Bible says:<br><br><b>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. But now is Christ from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</b><br>1 Corinthians 15:13-14, 20 <br><br>The Scripture above is the basis for our hope of glory. The Scripture further says, <i>“if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable”</i> (1 Corinthians 15:19). This is why as Christians, we should not despair even in tribulation because of the assurance of glory we have in Christ. <br><br>Our hope of glory is not an empty hope, according to Revelation 21:1-7, which assures us of a new heaven and a new earth where there shall be no more pain, sorrow, lack, sickness or death. Death shall be swallowed in victory (1 Corinthians 15:54). <br><br>Therefore, beloved, to have this hope in you, accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour today.

      "Many divine blessings are conditional. This is why there are many “ifs” in God’s covenants with mankind. For instance, in Deuteronomy 28:1 God promised the children of Israel that He would bless them so much so that they would be above all nations of the earth, if they would hearken diligently to His voice and keep His commandments. <br><br>The primary purpose of divine blessings is to make the blessed fellow fruitful and a blessing to others. Fruitfulness however, is also one of the conditional blessings of God. The primary condition for fruitfulness is found in John 15:4:<br><br><b>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</b><br><br>The question then is, “How can I abide in the Vine?” The answer is not far-fetched. You must first become a part of the Vine by responding positively to Jesus’ call in Matthew 11:28-30. When you confess Him as your Lord and saviour, you become grafted into the Vine – the Lord Jesus Christ. <br><br>The next phase is to abide in Jesus. Abiding in Jesus means living according to His will. Jesus said in John 8:31, <i>“…if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed”.</i> He also said in John 15:10, <i>“If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love”.</i><br><br>You can be fruitful spiritually, like Peter who preached one sermon and 3000 souls were won into the kingdom of God (Acts 2:38-41) or Paul, who God healed many sick people through his apron and handkerchiefs (Acts 19:11-12). You can also be fruitful materially, as in the case of Isaac, who became so wealthy that a whole nation began to envy him (Genesis 26:14-17). Furthermore, you can also be fruitful physically such that in your old age, you would remain strong, as in the case of Moses (Deuteronomy 34:7).<br><br>Beloved, as we read in our Bible text today, it is dangerous to be unfruitful. You will experience all-round fruitfulness if you surrender your life to Jesus and live according to His will for the rest of your life.",

      "It is one thing to receive divine blessings and quite another to keep them. I always teach my children in the faith that the grace needed to receive a miracle is not as great as the one needed to keep it. God has no problem blessing His people, but keeping the blessing is a responsibility many people fail to live up to. Today we will be looking at how to retain divine blessings.<br><br>The first thing one must do is to stay connected to the source of divine blessings - God. A branch will remain fruitful as long as it remains connected to the vine, and of course will become fruitless the moment it disconnects from its source of fruitfulness. Jesus is the vine and we His disciples are His branches. Without Him we can do nothing (John 15:5). <br><br>Secondly, to stay connected to the source of divine blessings, you must be holy. Sin causes a separation between the sinner and God (Isaiah 59:2). If God will not listen to a sinner, how then will such a fellow receive and retain divine blessings? The Almighty told Abraham this secret in Genesis 17: 1-2: <br><br><b>And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceeding.</b><br><br>According to our Bible reading of today, after Jesus had healed a man of a thirty-eight-year old sickness, He warned him to stay away from sin so he would not experience something even worse. <br><br>Finally, you must acknowledge that all you have is from God and always return all the glory to Him with thanksgiving. For example, Nebuchadnezzar failed to acknowledge that God was his source and he lost all he had. God however, restored all Nebuchadnezzar lost when the latter realised that he was nothing without God (Daniel 4:30-37).<br><br>I pray you will never lose your God-given blessings, in Jesus’ name. ",

      "Divine blessing can be described as a command from God that will make all the forces in heaven, on earth and under the earth favour an individual or group of people. A divinely blessed person or group of people will succeed where others are failing. For example, in our Bible reading today, Isaac sowed during a famine and he reaped a hundredfold. In other words, he succeeded where others were failing. We can trace this remarkable result to God’s blessing over Abraham, Isaac’s father in Genesis 22:17: <br><br><b>That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</b><br><br>God had promised to bless Abraham and multiply his seed after he passed the test in Genesis 22. Little wonder why Isaac would sow and reap a hundredfold during a famine. <>brIsaac however, also had a part to play in obtaining and enforcing the fulfilment of the divine blessing on his life. Firstly, he was obedient to his father even up to the point of death. Isaac could have escaped easily from Abraham when the latter laid him on the altar, but he did not. That must have really pleased God. Secondly, he obeyed God’s instruction to stay at Gerar even when humanly speaking, it did not appear to be the right thing to do at the time, considering the famine in the land. <br><br>Only those who are obedient to divine instructions will experience divine blessings. Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, told the maidens that whatever Jesus asked them to do, they should do it and their obedience led to the divine provision of much better wine for the guests at the wedding (John 2:5-10).<br><br>Beloved, divine blessing is sweet, pleasant and without sorrow. Surrender your life to Jesus Christ, live in complete obedience to God and you will experience divine blessings in every area of your life, in Jesus’ name. ",

For example, in our Bible reading for today, we see God feeding Elijah so that he would have the required strength to fulfill the divine mission set before him. The angel of the Lord said to him, <i>“Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.”</i> That meal gave him the strength he needed for forty days and forty nights as he travelled to Horeb, the mountain of God (1 Kings 19:7-8). <br><br>Many people however, want divine help for selfish reasons. Some of them are not even born again; yet they are asking for miracles. Such people fail to realise that the Almighty God is a prudent investor and He will not invest in a project that will not promote His Kingdom. For example, God needed a prophet so when Hannah asked for a son and promised to give him back to God, the Lord granted her request (1 Samuel 1).<br><br>Jesus said in Matthew 7:6: <br><b>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</b><br><br>The verse above implies that God will not give that which is holy to someone who is still living in sin. You cannot remain in the kingdom of darkness or be toying with sin as a Christian and expect God to help you. <br><br>Beloved, if you desire divine help, surrender your life to Jesus Christ and be determined to do only things that will give Him pleasure.

      "Divine help is comforting and assuring. It is however, not for everybody. Unless God is your Father, you may not be able to access divine help. In our Bible reading today, Jesus told the woman seeking His help that divine healing is reserved only for God’s children, so she was disqualified. Her faith in Jesus Christ however, eventually qualified her for divine help. <br><br>Therefore, you should ask yourself, “Am I a child of God?” “Have I surrendered all to the Lord Jesus?” Placing all your faith in Jesus and surrendering your life to Him is the only way to access God and divine help (John 14:6). <br><br>Another vital requirement to access divine help is knowing exactly what you need help with. The woman in our Bible reading today was very clear about what she wanted, and she got it as she persisted in her request, with all her faith in Christ Jesus. Bartimaeus is also an excellent example of someone who knew what he wanted God to do for him and got the divine help he sought (Mark 10:46-52). <br><br>It is also important to know where to seek for help. Beloved, where are you seeking help from? Many people seek help from different sources – man, rivers, mountains and so on. Everyone seeking help from other sources apart from the Almighty God will only have their sorrows multiplied as we see in Psalms 16:4.<br><br>You may be asking, “How do I seek divine help?” Jesus said: <i>“Ask, and it shall be given you…”</i> (Matthew 7:7). When asking the Lord for help however, don’t ask for things He has already empowered you to do yourself. For example, when God provides a job, don’t go to sleep and expect Him to do the work for you! There are however, many things that are beyond human capacity and the good news is that nothing is beyond God’s capacity. Ask Him for help with those things that no man can do for you. For example, only God can cause a woman without a womb to conceive and bring forth a set of twins. That was the testimony of a sister some years ago and I pray you will also experience unbelievable miracles, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Beloved, if you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, you have His open invitation to ask for everything you want in faith and He will do them for you according to His will.<br><br>",

      "The kind of help anyone can render is determined either by the person’s might or capability. Nobody can give what he or she does not have. This makes divine help very desirable since it comes from the unlimited God. David knew this secret and penned what we have as part of our text for today. He said, <i>“I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth”</i> (Psalms 121:1-2). The following are the steps we must take to secure divine help:<br><br>First, we must fear and trust the One who has unlimited power to help. Psalms 37:39-40 says that the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord and that He shall help and deliver them from the wicked because they trust Him. The second step is to keep the law of the Lord. Psalms 119:145-146 says: <i>“I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord: I will keep thy statutes. I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.”</i> Unfortunately, many self-professing Christians do not want to hear anything about the law of God and would rather overstretch the place of grace to the point of lawlessness. This is not God’s will.<br><br>The third step for those who would benefit from Divine help is to call on the Lord for the needed help. The Bible says in Exodus 20:3: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Looking up to anything or anyone apart from God is idolatry. This is dangerous because our God is a jealous God (Exodus 20:5). As a matter of fact, we short-change ourselves by trusting in man that is limited rather than trusting the Almighty, the Unlimited God. The Bible says:<br><br><b>Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horse, because they are strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord.</b><br>Isaiah 31:1.<br><br>Beloved, I encourage you to surrender your life to Jesus, live righteously and look up to God alone for help.

If they see that you are not one who is willing to praise God, they will lock you out. David seemed to be talking to the keepers of the gate when he said in Psalms 118:19, <i>“Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:”</i><br><br>It is as though God had instructed them thus: “If anyone comes here with complaints or requests without thanksgiving or praise, don’t open this gate for the fellow”.

Whatever is inside the place must be so valuable that they don’t want any unauthorised person to have access to it. There are many treasures in the presence of God and not just anybody can enjoy them. One of such treasures is fullness of joy (Psalms 16:11) and liberty (2 Corinthians 3:17).

      "When you ask people who or what they worship, they are most likely to tell you ‘God’, but then, many people are worshipping other things or persons apart from God. Some people worship their spouses, children, money, some their bellies, some their image on social media and, believe it or not, some worship their means of transportation. When I was in the grammar school, we had a teacher who had a bicycle that he loved so much. Whenever he got to a place that was muddy, he would get down from the bicycle and carry it across. He preferred for his feet to get dirty than his bicycle. He worshipped his bicycle.<br><br>Many come to God in prayers and get nothing from Him because He can see in their heart that there is an idol there. He knows that they only worship Him with their mouths, that their hearts are far from Him (Matthew 15:8). Since He is not their God, then He ignores them. If at all the Lord answers, He does so according to the idols in their hearts.<br><br><b>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols.</b><br><br>Ezekiel 14:4<br><br>In Numbers 22:19-35, Balaam valued the treasures that the king promised him more than the instruction of God. After God had told him not to heed the king’s call, he still went back to God when the servants came back to ask if he should go, so God answered him according to the idol in his heart, telling him to go. On his way, there was an angel waiting to kill him. Had it not been for the eyes of his donkey that were opened to see the angel, he would have been dead as a result of the idol of greed in his heart.<br><br>Our God is a jealous God. He said in Exodus 34:14, <i>“For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God”.</i>The moment you regard anyone or anything above God, He will leave you alone and believe me honestly, the worst thing that can ever happen to a person is for God to leave him or her.",

Ordinarily, Solomon should have been hated by all, but there he was, the one chosen to be king. He knew he did not deserve what he had received from God so he spared nothing when it came to thanking Him.<br><br>Many a time, you don’t thank God enough because you think you deserve all that He has given you, but if you look closely, you would see that you are wrong. The day God pointed out to me that because I am not a child from the first wife of my father, I ought not to be used by Him according to the law, but that His mercy had found me usable, I became more humble in my thanksgiving. Isaiah 64:6 says:<br><br><b>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</b> <br><br>If you think your blessings are a result of your hard work, you should go and see some people who are working far harder than you, yet are not rich.

That is what happened in Colossians 2:15 which says, <i>“And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.”</i> <br><br>2 Kings 6:8-20 tells us that a king considered Elisha as a threat, so he sent an entire army to arrest him. This however turned out to be an impossible mission because Elisha demonstrated spiritual superiority by arresting the entire army when they got to his place. As if that was not enough, he also led them as captives into their enemy’s territory.<br><br>When God sees a man or woman who is committed to a life of holiness, He will use that fellow to make an open shame of the enemy and arrest arresters. If you get really close to God, you won’t pray for your enemies to be destroyed because the Bible says in Psalms 23:5:<br><br><b>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</b><br><br>If all enemies are dead, who will behold your glory?

If you look through the Scriptures and study people who achieved great feats for God, you will notice that all of them spent quality time alone with God. In Exodus 24:18, Moses had been on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights spending time alone with God. No wonder he is the only man who ever saw God. After seeing the back of God in Exodus 33:23, the Bible says the glory that shone on his face was so bright that people could not look at him. That is what happens when you spend time with God: His glory rubs off on you and it is evident to everyone around you.<br><br>Many times when the Bible talks about Elijah, he was on the mountain top. You go to the mountain top because you want to get away from where people are so that you can be alone with God. What was the result of Elijah’s constant fellowship with God? He could call down fire from heaven anytime he wanted. He was also the first prophet to ever bring the dead back to life. It is in those times that you spend with God that He enlarges your capacity to do greater things than you used to. Joseph was a very busy man in Potiphar’s house, overseeing his master’s many great possessions. All that time that he was busy, he didn’t grow beyond being a dreamer. When he was locked up in prison however, he had time to be alone with God and grew from being a dreamer to becoming an interpreter of dreams.<br><br>Your greatest potential will only be realised when you spend quality time alone with God.

The widow’s sorrow ended and she returned home rejoicing. The Almighty God is going to collide with you today and you will experience a great transformation, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>During one of our programmes some years ago, the Lord gave me a revelation for someone in the meeting and I announced: “The Lord said there is someone here who should have been married but the mother says she would not get married. If the mother does not repent, she will be dead within a week”. A lady that was of a marriageable age believed the word was for her and she went home to tell her mother. The next day, the mother, furious, came with her to see me, saying, “My daughter came and informed me that you said I will die within a week”. I told her exactly what God had said, explaining that I hadn’t mentioned any name. After this, she asked the girl to leave the office, then turned to me, “It is not that I don’t want her to marry. It’s just that she is the one taking care of me. Once she marries, there will be no one to take care of me”. I replied, “That is not a problem; I will talk to the husband and they will continue to take care of you”. The mother then said, “In that case, she can marry”. Six months later, the daughter was married.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, we saw how God stepped into the situation of the Israelites and brought doom upon the Egyptians. This tells us that we must be careful when dealing with children of God because Jesus can decide to step into the situation at any time. When He decides to step into a situation, you had better be sure that you are on His side. If you surrender to Him willingly, then He will collide with all the forces against you but if you are not on His side, a collision with Him will bring about a negative result like it did for the Egyptians.",

I had gone out on a prayer walk in the middle of the night - deep into the bush where I could be alone to pray. I had my torch with me, but after praying for some time, the battery died and I needed to find my way out in that darkness. I then remembered something I was taught in primary school: that if the room is dark and you close your eyes for a while then open them, the place will look brighter. I closed my eyes for a while and then opened them. When I opened my eyes, the moon was shining so bright; everywhere was as bright as day. I walked out of the bush to the main road, then looked up again and didn’t see the moon. I know you probably don’t believe me, but it happened.<br><br>There was a young man whose aunty died and then was embalmed.

He took a handkerchief that we had anointed at one of our programmes and laid it on the corpse. He prayed, but then nothing happened. He wasn’t really expecting anything to happen anyway, he was just trying his faith. Sad, he turned to leave the room. As he got to the door, he heard a sound behind him. On looking back, he discovered that his aunt who had been dead for eleven days was sitting upright.

      "Beyond great joy, there is a higher concentration of this energy drink which is called ‘Exceeding Great Joy’. In our Bible reading for today, when the wise men who had been traveling a long way, looking for the new born King saw the star again, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. They continued on their journey as if they had just started. Exceeding great joy gives you the ability to go the extra mile, to do exceeding great things that ordinary people cannot do.<br><br>This exceeding great joy comes from the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). When you get this concentration of joy, people will assume that you are drunk. Imagine seeing two people asking a man who has been lame all his life to stand and walk. That doesn’t make any sense, but it is only possible when you are filled with the Holy Ghost.<br><br>One unique thing about this concentration of joy is that as you utilise it, you get even more of it. If you have ever seen someone who the doctors say has only a few more weeks to live and you pray for the fellow, then he or she gets healed and lives for many more decades after that, you would get a new rush of exceeding great joy. Your faith would increase and you would be empowered to do more. There are so many people who are filled with the Holy Ghost but never pray for the sick or try to perform any miracle. Once, when I was crying to God to empower me to work miracles, He told me, “Keep quiet. Have you used the power that I have given you?” I said, “What power?” He answered, “Are you baptised in the Holy Ghost?” I said, “Yes”. He responded, “What does Acts 1:8 say?” I knew what it says, but then I didn’t feel like I had received any power so I responded, “But, I don’t feel powerful” to which He replied, “Did I say the just shall live by feelings or by faith?”<br><br>The day after this conversation, a woman brought her dying child who had not slept for days, to me for prayers. I remembered my conversation with God, so I prayed for the child. After praying, I opened my eyes to see that the child had fallen asleep. When he woke up, he was completely fine. That boosted my faith and filled my heart with exceeding great joy. I am grateful that He is still filling me with exceeding great joy and working many great miracles through me.

When you have great joy, you will be able to do anything your heart desires for God.<br><br>When we started building the camp, because of the great joy of having our own campground at last, we did things that people would consider impossible – like building and completing a house and then furnishing it within seven days! As the Lord lives, you will experience great joy today, in Jesus’ name. <br><br>Now, what are the things that can bring you great joy? 3 John 1:4 says, <i>“I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.”</i> You experience great joy when you are making disciples for Christ, when you are seeing people being saved from the horrors of darkness into the light of God. In the example I gave above where we built a house in seven days, we were not joyful because we now had a place to sleep, but rather because we now had a bigger platform through which we could win more souls to Christ. If you have not been winning souls to Christ, you don’t know what joy you have been missing. Jesus said there is joy in heaven whenever one sinner repents (Luke 15:7). So, if God wins a soul through you, and there is rejoicing in heaven, don’t you think that you would also be a partaker of that joy?<br><br>This great joy is majorly fuelled by the knowledge of how much Jesus loves us. Philemon 1:7 says there is great joy in love. When we consider how much God’s love has done for us, we are strengthened to do anything just to make sure that His will is done on earth.

Joy is the energy drink that heaven gives you to keep you strong and healthy enough to work. The thing about this energy drink is that it has different concentrations, depending on how much of it is needed per time. The one with the smallest concentration is what I will call regular joy. You are supposed to have a dose of it every morning. Psalms 30:5 says weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. People who suffer depression find it difficult to even stand from their beds in the morning. If you are experiencing any form of depression or sadness, I pray that the Lord will fill you with joy and strengthen you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>One of the ways of getting joy is through hearing good news. Psalms 51:8 says, <i>“Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice”.</i><br><br>A brother returned from work so tired he refused dinner and just went to bed. As soon as he got to his room, his fiancée came to visit. His mother welcomed her but said the brother was very tired and had gone to bed.

The good news that his fiancée was around had given him strength that even he did not know he had. You will hear good news every morning, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The word of God is good news, it gives joy. Study it every morning; you will experience joy and receive strength.

      "Time is quite a difficult concept to define. One very simple way to describe it is that it is a river that constantly flows. It keeps flowing in a certain direction and carries everyone along with it. No matter what you are doing, time keeps flowing on. Therefore, when you don’t do what you are supposed to at the right time, not only would you have wasted a part of your time on earth, but a part of your life also. This is why you cannot afford to be lazy.<br><br>One of the things you must understand about the river called time is that as it is carrying you on, it is constantly throwing opportunities at you. It carries you through these opportunities from the day you were born until the day you die. As you flow, you go from one place to another and come across one person or another. Each person or place comes as an opportunity. If you don't grab it when you are there, you may miss it forever as the river doesn't flow backwards. When you understand this about time, you will realise that what decides if you will be successful is your ability to identify and make use of opportunities (Ecclesiastes 9:11).<br><br>The river called time has boundaries on both sides and you are usually in the middle. Occasionally, when God really loves you, He brings you in contact with the right person and tells you to follow him or her. If you are wise enough to obey Him without questions, then you will arrive at your God-ordained destiny. This is what happened to me when I met my Father-in-the-Lord – Pa Akindayomi. I had a Ph.D. in Mathematics which was a big deal back then. My Father-in-the-Lord could not even read or write. He could only read the Bible because of a God-given ability, yet God said I should submit to and follow him. Eventually, when he was going to be with the Lord, he wrote in his will that I should take over the leadership of the Church. My salary at the time was more than the income of the entire Church, but I obeyed. That is how the river of time brought me to where I am now.<br><br>If you want to fulfil your destiny, rely on God to show you the opportunities hidden in the people you meet and places you go, so that you will arrive at your expected end.",

      "Some people find it difficult to trust God. They would rather put their trust in things that they can see than in the Lord that they cannot see. Many times, it is because we feel we are intelligent and our intelligence has helped us in the past so we want to be able to use it for everything. I once went to minister the Holy Ghost baptism to a group of people; the uneducated ones were baptised almost as soon as the ministration started, but the educated ones were looking around, trying to understand how the baptism would come. These were doubting Thomases. Thomas was a man who would not believe until he saw with his eyes. John 20:29 says, <i>“Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”</i><br><br>Apostle Paul also said:<br><br><b>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal</b><br><br>. 2 Corinthians 4:18<br><br>Where you look to when you are in need of help is where your faith lies. For example, David said he would look up to the hills from whence came his help – the Lord (Psalms 121:1-2). If you look to man, then your faith lies in man. If you look to your money, then that is where your faith lies. God can use either to meet your need, but you are to look to God and God alone. God is displeased when you have faith in anything or anyone else but Him. Hebrews 11:6 says without faith it is impossible to please God. Until you take your eyes off the physical and set them on Him in the Spirit, some things will remain out of your reach.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, Asa found it difficult to look to God for his healing even when physicians had failed him. This is a stronghold of the devil that must be broken. If you study your Bible diligently, pray without ceasing, and fellowship regularly with other believers, you would soon begin to see how the spiritual controls the physical.<br><br>Spend more time with God than you do with man and that stronghold of dependence on physical things will be broken.",

      "Our memory verse for today says that fear is a tormentor. According to 2 Timothy 1:7, fear is a spirit and since it is not a gift from God, then it is from the devil. In Proverbs 29:25, God says the fear of man brings a snare. In other words, if you are afraid of a man, you will fall into a trap. The reason many people run to witch doctors is fear, which is why they keep looking for protection against all kinds of enemies.<br><br>One of the things that makes fear so terrible is that almost invariably, that which you are afraid of will come to you (Job 3:25). The fear of death has put many people in bondage today. The question now is: is everyone not going to die anyway? Hebrews 9:27 says death is an appointment that everyone must keep. The devil keeps people in bondage because of something that they should be prepared for rather than afraid of.<br><br>When you have God with you, fear will get away from you. David said that the reason he had no fear even in the valley of the shadow of death is because he had the presence of God with him (Psalms 23:4). Romans 8:15 says you do not have the spirit of bondage to fear, rather, that of adoption, giving you the right to call God your Daddy. The true realisation that you are a child of God and that God is with you always will chase fear out of your life. No child is afraid of a bully when his daddy is standing beside him. As long as you are a child of God who lives holy, you can be sure that God is with you always. Our Bible reading for today says you should not be afraid for God is with you, it says He will hold your hand and strengthen you. If you have God on your side, you have nothing to fear.<br><br>Draw close to God and He will draw close to you (James 4:8). This means that if you surrender your life to Jesus and begin to live a holy life, God will come close to you and fear will disappear from your life. Sin will create a gap between you and God as He won’t even hear the prayers of unrepentant sinners (John 9:31) not to talk of saving them from danger.<br>The only thing I fear is for God to leave me because if He does, I know that I am finished. That is why I live holy; I cannot afford to be away from His presence. What about you?",

      "Personality disorders are becoming more and more common, even amongst children of God. These disorders typically involve patterns of behaviour and thinking that usually makes it difficult to form and maintain a close relationship with God. They also make it difficult to meet the daily demands of one's personal, spiritual, and work life. Experts say that these personality disorders can be identified by three major characteristics: intense and unstable emotions, eccentric and odd behaviour or extreme fear and nervousness. Some studies have also shown that personality disorders are often associated with high levels of self-injury and are even sometimes linked to suicide. The situation is so bleak that Job 10:22 described it as, <i>“A land of \ufeffdarkness, as \ufeffdarkness itself; And of \ufeffthe shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as \ufeffdarkness”</i>. I pray that you and your loved ones will never experience this, in Jesus’ name. If you are already experiencing this, may the power of God deliver you today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Several passages of the Bible confirm that spiritual personality disorder could come through three major sources: as an attack from the enemy (John 10:10), self-infliction (Mark 7:23, Galatians 5:21), or as a divine curse, a repercussion of sin, as recorded in 1 Corinthians 3:17. Deuteronomy 28:20, also says:<br><br><b>The Lord \ufeffshall send upon thee cursing, \ufeffvexation, and \ufeffrebuke, in all \ufeffthat thou settest thine hand unto \ufefffor to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.</b><br><br>Repent of all your sins and accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. Jesus intervened and restored several cases of personality disorders and insanity to wholeness by His word. I therefore decree in the name that is above every other name: Be delivered from every spiritual personality disorder and insanity today, in the name of Jesus.",

For example, He can call some people to join Him in politics because He has an agenda to use the political office they will occupy as a tool in redeeming the world. <br>God is not a Sunday-Sunday God.

      "The call of God is actually a call to God. Many people think that when God calls them, it is a call to something, whereas it is a call to Him. When He calls you, He is saying, “Come closer to me”. In Mark 3:14, the Bible says that the first reason He called the disciples was that they should be with Him.<br><br>The call of God is two-fold. First, He can call you to leave your sinful ways, to leave the kingdom of darkness and come to Him in the Kingdom of light. This is the call He made in Matthew 11:28: <i>“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”</i>. We will focus on this first call today.<br><br>This call is the very one that every human being will receive. When you are in a service and you hear the preacher making the altar call, it is actually God Himself calling out to sinners to leave their sinful ways and come to Him for salvation.<br><br>There was a very notorious young man who brought someone to Church with his motorcycle. He waited for a little while outside the Church and listened to the sermon. When the altar call was made he considered surrendering his life to Christ, but then decided against it and zoomed off. Unfortunately, he got involved in an accident later that day and died. If only he had answered the altar call when it was made! Even if he had still died, at least he would have made it to heaven.<br><br>God’s call unto salvation is extended to everyone. He desires to call all sinners out of darkness into His marvellous light. He is seeking to make everyone a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation and a peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9).<br><br>Some however, heed God’s call, become saved then start to sin again wilfully. Such people are not fit for the kingdom of God (Luke 9:62) and He has promised to spue such out of His mouth if they do not retrace their steps back to Him. (Revelation 3:16). ",

Elijah looked defenceless physically but when they tried to arrest him, he called fire down from heaven to roast all of them. When the king sent another 50 soldiers, they got roasted too. Thereafter, he sent another set of 50 soldiers and their captain. When they got to the mountain where Elijah was and saw the ashes of the two sets of soldiers that had been consumed by fire, the Bible says the captain fell on his knees and begged the man of God to spare him as he was only doing his job. The angel of God then spoke to Elijah and said, “You can go with him”. What made his case different? Honour. That is why he was able to succeed at what got the previous captains and soldiers roasted.<br><br>It doesn’t matter who you are; if you despise an anointed man or woman of God, if you mock him or her, you could pay dearly for it. In 2 Kings 2:23-24, you see what happened when some children started mocking Elisha; they ended up being eaten by bears. The anointing on a man or woman of God can work dangerously against anyone who despises him or her. Any true man or woman of God will tell you that as the anointing increases, he or she speaks less because whatever he or she says when angry can kill.<br><br>There was a man who decided to take over the Parish of The Redeemed Christian Church of God he was pastoring.

Since then, I learned to not take offence easily and if at all I am offended, I keep my mouth shut. It is better to provoke a blessing from the anointed than a curse. The easiest way to provoke a man or woman of God to bless you is to honour him or her. When you honour the anointed, the anointing will work in your favour. The king of Israel honoured Elisha by calling him Father. In turn, Elisha used his anointing to save him and his army when their enemies laid ambush for them.

Fortunately for me, one of my spiritual children working with an arm of the government caught whiff of the plan and alerted me that they were coming for me within the next two weeks. I did not tell my wife; I just went out that night on my normal prayer walk and my Lover spoke to me. That is one thing that love does; it enables you to hear secrets from God (John 13:21-26).

A few days later, at the Holy Ghost Service on the first Friday of June, I said to the congregation, “Greet one another and say, “Happy New Year”.

      "Some people query God for not answering their prayers because they have been praying for so long. This has made them conclude that God is not real. The problem however, is not with Him; after all, many other people receive answers to prayers from Him daily. If there is a problem at all, it is likely to be from the fellow who is praying. Isaiah 59:1-2 tells us that God can always hear us but our sins separate and hide our faces from Him. If He doesn’t hear your prayer at all, how is He going to answer? How can you continue in sin and expect grace to abound? The Bible’s response to that is, “God forbid” (Romans 6:1-2).<br><br>Some people sow in Church and get no harvest, then they turn around to say that God’s word is not true, whereas the issue may be that God rejected their offering because of their sins (Proverbs 15:8).

She met with me and I prayed for her. While praying for her, I laid my hand upon her and she fell. When she came around, she rejoiced that she had fallen under the anointing and was sure her miracle was on the way. A year later, she came back with a query because she had not given birth. I was already thinking that maybe God wanted to give her a second touch when all of a sudden, I heard God say, “Ask her how many boyfriends she has”. If I hadn’t known the voice of God, I wouldn’t have asked because she was a highly placed person in the society. I managed to ask her and she said she had six boyfriends! I was shocked.

      "In 2 Kings 6:1-7, Prophet Elisha’s children-in-the-Lord asked for permission to go to Jordan and build a bigger place as their current accommodation had become too small for them. As they were cutting down trees, one of their axe heads fell into the river and sank. There seemed to be no way to bring it back, until they factored God into the equation. Elisha got up, cut a stick from a tree and threw it into the river. If you have done a little bit of science, you would know that sticks float but then this one had anointing and so as soon as it got into the river, it sank. When it reached the axe head, it transferred the anointing to it and the iron that had sunk floated back to the surface of the river. All these happened because with God, nothing is impossible.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, Abraham and Sarah were past child-bearing age. God visited them and while they were entertaining Him, He said Sarah would have a baby in 9 months’ time. The Bible says in verse 12 that Sarah laughed within her. I would have laughed out too because ordinarily, a 90-year-old woman would not have been able to bear a child. Moreover, would Sarah and her husband still have been intimate at that age? She denied laughing, but then the Lord said, “Well, I know you laughed; nine months from now, you will carry a baby whose name will be Laughter”. True to God’s word, in nine months’ time, Sarah was laughing because even though she was 90 years old, she had now become a mother.<br><br>There is nothing impossible for my God to do. I have good news for you today: even if you have passed child bearing age and you are yet to give birth to a child, nine months from now, you will carry your set of twins in Jesus’ name.<br><br>We serve a God who can do the absolutely impossible (Luke 1:37).

This is the season when you want to say like Apostle Paul:<br><br><b>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</b><br>1 Corinthians 11:1<br><br>Many times, people in this season look for others in the younger generation to mentor.

You must be careful in this season not to spread a virus in the systems of people. When people seem to have found someone whose message they enjoy, they begin to spread it and before long, that message would have become a doctrine. What we know today as the extreme and erroneous message of grace was started by a man called Nicholas. He was amongst the first deacons (Acts 6:5); however, he had adopted an erroneous way of living a so-called Christian life and by the time we get to Revelation 2:15, we see that his erroneous way had become a misleading doctrine within the Church, as it still is today.<br><br>In this third season of life, your lifestyle and behaviour will also begin to influence others.An example can be seen in 2 Peter 2:15 where some Christians were described to be following in the steps of Balaam who chose to use the power of God for material gains.

At this stage, he or she wants to be perceived as a success by everyone. For example, choristers and pastors in this stage will typically seek to impress others when they sing and preach respectively. A person in this stage may be financially comfortable already, but would be seeking prestige. This is the season that King Saul was in 1 Samuel 15:24.<br><br><b>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</b><br><br>King Saul had money and power, but he also wanted to impress the people and that got him into trouble.<br><br>If you are doing things because of what people think of you, you are likely to get into big trouble soon. The cheer of people may seem good now, but soon you will realise that those who are shouting,Hosanna today” will be the same ones shouting, “Crucify Him” tomorrow. This is why you must shun what people think and do what is right, whether it is the popular opinion or not.<br><br>The Holy Ghost Congress which we hold in Nigeria is a week-long programme, with Friday recording the largest attendance - running into millions. There was a singer who was invited to minister on the Thursday of the Congress. She refused, saying she would only come to sing on Friday when the crowd would be largest. Of course we withdrew the invitation because she was not interested in singing for God but for the crowd.<br><br>Those who are more concerned about how they look on social media are risking being destroyed by the same people they are trying to impress. Think about it: if you are trying to impress people, it means that you will always want to jump on the next trend. Trends never end; this means that you would be caught in a never-ending rat race.

When a child is born, without being taught, he or she tightly grips anything placed in his or her hand and, should the item fall, would cry to get it back. That is the first season of life – when the fellow just wants to acquire. It is in this season that many people get certificates so that they can get high-paying jobs. Everything that a person does during this season is usually geared towards becoming rich. Unfortunately, it is in this season that many people are lured by the devil into illegal and immoral activities to get money. When you check the people who have been proven to engage in ‘yahoo yahoo’ (cybercrime), or ladies selling their bodies for money, even those who kidnap and rob, you would find that they are usually young people. If you are young and don’t have an inordinate ambition to be rich, then you will be safe from the lures of the devil. Though it is good to be rich, you should not pursue wealth at the expense of your soul.<br><br>After chasing money for so long, the young fellow will at some point look around and see that even money does not satisfy (Ecclesiastes 5:10). He or she would realise the truth in the Scripture in Luke 12:15 which says, <i>“And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”</i><br><br>Many years ago, whenever I visited America and Pastor Stephen Rathod picked me up, the first thing I used to ask him, after exchanging greetings, was, “Where are they having sales?” It was very important to me to buy things in America during the sales period. Years later, when I visited the US again, he was surprised I didn’t ask to be shown where I could buy things on sales. I told him that time had passed.

These examples show how divine weapons that seem unimportant to the enemy were deployed to accomplish great victories for the people of God.<br><br>We also have clear examples of what happens when children are used to symbolise divine weapons. Psalms 127:3-5 says:<br><br><b>Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: And the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; So are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be ashamed, But they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</b><br><br>The above passage confirms that though children have biological parents, they are of divine origin. Children are compared with arrows which require much skill, craftsmanship, and training before they can be used effectively. So also, children need the knowledge of the word of God, good education, discipline and godly upbringing, to assume the leadership positions that God has in store for them in life.<br><br>The passage further tells us that they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. In Bible days, the city gate was like a public square, the gathering place where elders sat to settle disputes, render judgment, and make important decisions. Boaz settled the issue of his marriage to Ruth at the city gate in Ruth 4:1-6.

The gate of mercy can snap shut within the twinkling of an eye. Proverbs 29:1 says, <i>“He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy”.</i><br><br>Many a time when the gate makes an attempt to snap shut, God’s love will push it open again, but a time would come when it will snap shut and nothing can open it again.<br><br>Some years ago, a woman was very sick and the doctors said there was nothing more they could do for her so her relatives brought her to me for prayers. As I laid my hand on her, I felt the anointing like hot oil flow through my hand, but as it got to her head, it returned immediately.

I ran back to the altar, pleading for God to have mercy on her, but by the time I went three times and returned to lay hands on her again, she was dead.<br><br>Remember the story of the fruitless tree in Luke 13:6-9?

      "It is true that we wrestle with many external enemies described as principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12). Many people however, fight against themselves thereby constituting an internal enemy to themselves. <br><br>For example, there are many people who believe they are free to do anything they wish with their body; they therefore would not deny themselves anything their heart desires. This mindset often leads to sinful practices like indecent dressing, drunkenness, sexual immorality, gluttony, lasciviousness, idolatry, anger, selfishness, drug addiction and the likes. Such practices often produce results that are detrimental to the body, sometimes generating life-threatening repercussions. These sinful practices should therefore be correctly identified as internal enemies of all human beings. 1 Corinthians 3:17 says:<br><br><b>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</b><br><br>This is an important statement with a very serious implication. The Almighty God, our Creator, wants us to know that He created us as His own dwelling place. He went on to say that if anyone defiles the temple of God, he or she shall be destroyed. This is probably the source of the increase in strange ailments and reduction in life expectancy across the world. Those who defile or abuse their bodies with alcohol, hard drugs, sexual immorality, unhygienic food and unhealthy exposure to dangerous substances often become sick and end up dying prematurely. Many incidents of youths all over the world dying from drug addiction, mental illness, hypertension, suicide, liver-related problems and so on are traceable to these internal enemies. Mark 7:23 tells us that all these evil things come from within and defile the man (the temple of God), while Galatians 5:21 says without exception that everyone who practices such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",

Submission on the other hand, is when you want something totally different from what the other fellow wants, but because you have to submit, you do what he or she asks you to.<br><br>One who submits to God is that fellow who will do whatever God says – whether it is logical or not, convenient or not. Those who put their own wishes aside and just say, “If this is what God says, that is what I will do”. Once the devil knows you are that submissive to God, when you begin to resist him, he will flee. James 4:7 says:<br><br><b>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</b> <br><br>The devil knows those who are 100% submissive to God. Those who will do whatever God says even if they have to die doing it. On the other hand, he knows those who are submissive to their bellies or their sexual drive; those who are lovers of the world and those who are in it. It is only when your submission to God is complete that you can have the authority to revenge any disobedience (2 Corinthians 10:6).<br><br>If you want to resist the devil so that he will flee from you, then you have to be completely submissive to God.

This is why Proverbs 9:10 says:<br><br><b>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</b><br><br>There is no greater foolishness than disregard for God. How can you fear people who are limited in power and authority, then have no fear for the One who can do as He pleases, who is answerable to no one (Daniel 4:35)?<br><br>If you can fear those who can kill your body, how much more the One who can destroy both your body and soul in hell (Matthew 10:28)? God should never be toyed with. I know there are people who tell you that you are not to fear God, but to just reverence Him. I don’t know if they read that from their Bible, but my own Bible does not say the reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom, but rather, the fear of the Lord.<br><br>I don’t play carelessly with fire. No matter how cold I get, I don’t put my hand in it because I fear it. Our God is the Consuming Fire (Hebrews 12:29). You should therefore not only reverence Him, but fear Him also. Even a mad dog recognises fire when it sees it and does not play carelessly with it.<br><br>If you don’t fear God, you are capable of doing any evil. The interesting thing is that, whether you fear fire or not, if you touch it, it will burn you. If, as a result of the fact that you have no fear of God you continue to commit sin, it is only a matter of time before the repercussions would start coming.<br><br>A person may enjoy the pleasures of sin here on earth, and may even be popular for being such a great sinner, but a time is coming when the person will leave this world and then face the judgement of God which will lead to eternal damnation for such a person.<br><br>Beloved, it is better to fear God, live holy and receive eternal life than to disregard Him here on earth and spend eternity burning in the lake of fire.

You need to stay away from such friends.<br><br>There are some character flaws you should look out for and ensure you do not keep people who have such as friends. For example, if your friend’s temper runs hot, stay away from him or her, so you don’t learn his or her ways and ensnare your soul (Proverbs 22:24-25).<br><br>Many years ago, I was working as a teacher and befriended a colleague who was from the same part of the country as I. I however, didn’t know much about him. One day on our way to Ibadan for a teachers’ programme, we got off the lorry in Ile-Ife, where we would board another to Ibadan. This friend of mine then said he wanted to say hello to a chief nearby and asked me to come along. I did, after all, we were friends. We got there, he knocked on a door and was asked a strange question from inside, “is it a fish or a crab?” My friend answered and said, “One fish and one crab”. We were let in, but as we left, I began to wonder what these strange statements meant. When we arrived in Ibadan, he said he wanted to visit another fellow. I followed him, he knocked at the door and was asked, “Who is that? a goat or a sheep?” My friend answered, “One goat, one sheep”. By now, I was seriously troubled. I got home and asked the elders what the statements meant. They said, knowingly, “Ah, where did you hear that?”<br><br>That was the end of my friendship with that fellow. Up to today, I don’t understand what those statements really meant, but I didn’t have to be told that they were occultic and dangerous. Check your friends, be watchful and careful. The Bible says evil communication corrupts good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33). The Romans used to say, “As bad apples spoil good ones, so do bad friends spoil good boys”.<br><br>Before today is out, do a thorough check on all your friends.

Genesis 39:8-9 records Joseph’s response to the offer:<br><br><b> But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; there is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</b><br><br>It was wisdom, brought about by the fear of God, that kept Joseph away from committing sexual immorality with his master’s wife. No wonder the Bible says the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10). How I wish all children of God would embrace the fear of God so that they can begin to live above temptation and sin. It is wisdom to run away from sin because the Bible says in Romans 6:23, <i>“The wages of sin is death…”</i> and this refers to eternal death.\xa0Beloved, sexual immorality is forbidden; seek godly wisdom to avoid this deadly sin.<br><br>In the last hour before the arrest of Jesus Christ, He had a foreknowledge of what was about to happen to Him and thus had a private meeting with His disciples at Gethsemane, where He gave them the antidote to temptation and sin. Matthew 26:41 says, <i>“Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak..”</i> In this passage, Jesus named watchfulness and prayer as the antidote to temptation and sin.<br><br>\xa0We are therefore called to be alert to dangers in the Christian journey such as sexual immorality, false teachings, worldliness, love of money, inordinate ambition, sinful pleasure, and other forms of temptation and sin. The Bible says the end is near so we should be sober and watch unto prayer (1 Peter 4:7). Sexual immorality is forbidden; watch and pray over the type of content you and your family consume.

      "The phrase ‘sexual immorality’ covers all improper sexual conducts and practices like fornication, adultery, masturbation, prostitution, pornography, incest, homosexuality, rape, child sexual abuse, bestiality and so on.<br><br>There is a special relationship between these sins and the human eye as revealed in 2 Peter 2:14.The eye or face is sometimes used interchangeably in the Bible and both are very important for effective communication. This is why the Bible speaks of having eyes full of adultery.<br><br>Adultery and fornication are sexual practices that are considered immoral and abominable according to the word of God. Having eyes full of sexual immorality means communicating sexual attraction or immoral interest with the eyes or face. In extreme cases, it could also mean that a person’s mind is always filled with sensual or erotic desire especially towards persons other than their spouses.<br><br>The fact however, remains that the allure of a promiscuous person is centred in the eyes or face, as revealed by Proverbs 6:25 that says, <i>“…neither let her take thee with her eyelids”,</i> and Isaiah 3:16 that talks about walking around with stretched necks and promiscuous eyes. For this reason, painting the face and eyelids was regarded as a means of amplifying beauty and sexual attraction; thus promiscuous people have used it as a means of seduction since Bible days (like Jezebel in 2 Kings 9:30). Meanwhile, our Lord Jesus Christ equates looking at a member of the opposite sex lustfully with adultery (Matthew 5:28). This means that those who deliberately makeup and dress to amplify their sexual attraction are in actual fact causing others to commit adultery on a daily basis.<br><br>Since Christians must be careful not to cause others to stumble, according to Romans 14:13 and 1 Corinthians 8:9, we all must ensure that we are modest in our dressing (1 Timothy 2:9-10) and conduct so we do not become a stumbling block in the path of others.

When Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment is, His answer was: Love God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind and love your neighbour as yourself. He then went further to say, <i>“On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets”</i> (Matthew 22:36-40).<br><br>True love is in the DNA of every genuine child of God. Anyone who claims to be a Christian and does not have love as one of his or her characteristics is nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-2).<br><br>If there is true love, then it implies that there is false love. True love is empathetic in nature. True love does not do good for people to see, it does good because it feels the pain of the one who is loved. In our Bible reading for today, James says if you truly love someone, you would do everything within your power to solve their problems. Unfortunately, these days, when many Christians see another who they can help, they would rather pray to God to help the fellow than help him or her themselves. That is fake love. True love is when you make sacrifices to help your brother or sister and do all you can to ensure their problems are solved.<br><br>Some years ago, after a major programme, I was so tired that I just wanted to get on my bed and sleep, but as I was leaving the venue in my car, I heard the voice of a man shouting, “Daddy help me, Daddy help me”.

      "The Bible takes the subject of love so seriously that it is equated with the sum of all the commandments of God (Matthew 22:36-40). The Bible goes further to say that love is the fulfilment of the law (Romans 13:10). The use of the word ‘Law’ in the Bible, is usually a reference to all the commandments and statutes recorded in the Old Testament. Now, the reality that God equates love to the whole of the Old Testament Bible is serious food for thought. The Bible in 1 Corinthians 13:1-2 says:<br><br><b>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</b><br><br>The passage above speaks clearly about the importance of love and how children of God should rate it on the scale of spirituality. Here, God compared some special spiritual gifts of uncommon value to love. Speaking in the tongues of men and angels means the ability to speak in heavenly tongues as well as interpreting it in the language of men. The interpretation of tongues has always been a rare gift that is highly sought after in the body of Christ, yet anyone with this gift without having love is described as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal - viewed by God as a mere noisemaker.<br><br>Furthermore, the Bible says if one should have the gift of prophecy, understand all mysteries and have all knowledge, with enough faith to do great miracles, without love, such a person would amount to nothing in the eyes of God. Love is the golden rule by which whatever gifts we exhibit and whatever services we offer to God are measured. Therefore, love is the ultimate commandment. Romans 13:10 says, “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law”. The service that pleases God is one from the heart, rendered in love. God is love. If you are born again, you have the capacity to manifest the agape love. It is a compulsory virtue in Christianity.",

In Leviticus 25:4-5, God also ordained a seventh year Sabbath of rest, <i>“…when the land will not be cultivated, the people and animals will also take their rest from farming activities for a whole year”.</i> Surprisingly, Exodus 31:14 says, <i>“Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for \ufeffwhosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people”.</i> Rest is so important to God that He places a heavy penalty on defaulters.<br><br>Despite the observance of these holidays, the Nation of Israel continued to be more prosperous than their neighbours that did not have the tradition of taking any rest.

      "God can help you even when the odds against you are overwhelming. When He decides to, He will show the odds that He is still the All-Sufficient God. In Isaiah 43:13, the Almighty God says no one can hinder Him when He decides to work. In other words, it doesn’t matter how many forces are at war against you; when God decides to help, nothing can stop Him.<br><br>In Daniel 3, when Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were to be thrown into the fiery furnace, the furnace was heated seven times more, yet the only people who died were the soldiers who threw the boys inside. The people thrown right into the furnace came out alive. In Judges 15:11-15, the Bible says that Samson’s relatives handed him over to the external enemies, but by the end of the day, a thousand of these enemies were dead while the rest fled. It doesn’t matter how many enemies you are dealing with; God will help you deal with them all, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>My God is the One who makes a way where there is no way, so when it looks like there is no way out, God can still make a way. One day while I was abroad, I was told that one of my spiritual sons was in the hospital, suffering from an advanced case of cancer. Humanly speaking, his case was completely hopeless. I went to visit him at the hospital on a Saturday and prayed for him. By the following Wednesday, my son was discharged completely whole. The beauty of that story is that every other person who had been in the ward when I prayed for him was also discharged.<br><br>There was also this case of a lady that had been told by doctors that she had a 99.99% chance of dying from a particular disease. I couldn’t go to the hospital at that time, so I prayed on a handkerchief instead and sent it to her. God used the remaining 0.01% that the doctor left out and to save her life. She wrote a book titled, ‘Rescued from the Jaws of Death’, testifying of her divine healing.I don’t know how hopeless your case seems to be; everyone may have even given up on you, but I decree that God will make a way for you today, in Jesus’ name.

      "The help of God usually comes from unexpected sources like in our Bible reading for today. You might be thinking that help would come from a particular place and then it comes from a completely unexpected source. God can send help to you from anywhere because He owns the world and its fullness (Psalms 24:1). The Bible tells us in Exodus 17:1-6 that God brought water out of the rock, meaning that He can send help from the most unexpected sources. Don’t think of how God will help you; just know that He will do it.<br><br>When I was to move into my first house at the Redemption Camp in 1985 - now known as The Open Heavens International Centre, it didn’t have any doors or windows and I wanted to move in before October 1. That weekend, we had a School of Disciples meeting and I could have easily raised the needed N50 from my students, since they were more than fifty in number. To me however, that would have been begging. When God called me to ministry, He told me that He would be my source. I just told them, “I need a miracle”. They all prayed for me and left. The following Sunday there was this young lady who came to my office and gave me money that she had been saving so that she could travel abroad. I accepted the money, prayed for her and she left. When I opened the envelope, it was the exact amount that I needed. One Sunday, I saw this young girl again, gorgeously dressed. She explained that she had just returned from London. Her friend’s parents took her abroad on holidays with them, as their daughter had refused to go without her. They paid all her expenses and gave her a shopping allowance. God used that girl to meet my need, then He used her friend’s parents to meet her own need.<br><br>You don’t need to calculate how God will send help to you; just tell Him what you need and trust Him.

      "Divine help refers to the intervention of God to get a man to a place he is trying to reach. The help of God is always on time; God is never late (Psalms 46:1). Just at the moment when you need help, He will be there - in the nick of time (Psalms 124:1-7).<br><br>In 1 Kings 17:8-16, we read the story of a widow in a time of famine. She was going to prepare her last meal so that she and her son could eat before dying. Unknown to her, help was already on the way and that seemingly last meal was the first of many more. Your help is already on its way, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Many years ago, during our annual Convention in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, my wife came to me and said, “Darling, we need N5,000 to feed the people today”. This was a lot of money in those days. Although I had no money on me then, I responded, “Good, I will send for you”. She left and I turned to the Helper of the helpless, praying for a way to feed everyone there.<br><br>Not long after, a man was driving past and decided to stop by. He asked what we were doing and I told him we were having a convention. He said, “That is a very wonderful idea. Next year, I will be part of it”. I thought, “I am talking of today; this man is talking of next year”. The man then put his hand in his pocket and said, “But for now, have this”. He gave me an envelope and left. I opened the envelope and found N1000 in it. I said, “Thank you Lord; one down, four to go.” Before long, the youths came to my office and at the end of their visit gave me an envelope with N2000 in it. Within a short time, I had all the money needed for the feeding. In the nick of time, God sent help to me. Your help will come today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The interesting thing about God is that He is the Reverser of the irreversible, so even when it looks as if He is late, He can reverse time for your sake. Sarah laughed when God told her she would carry a child because she believed it was already too late for her and Abraham, but she carried a child to term and delivered safely (Genesis 21:1-2).

      "When God promotes you, you must never forget that your loyalty must be to Him and only Him. 1 Samuel 15:15-24 records that when Saul became king, he forgot the One who put him there. God sent him on a mission; he failed, and his reason was, “I feared the people”. Don’t try to lower the standard of God because you want to be popular.<br><br>Don’t forget that God is sovereign; He can do and undo. He can change His mind. Each time we read 1 Samuel 2, we love to quote verse 8 and ignore verse 7 which says that the Lord makes rich and He makes poor, He can take a beggar from the dunghill and promote him until he is sitting with princes. In 1 Samuel 2:30, He said to Eli,<i> “I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the\xa0Lord\xa0saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed”.</i><br><br>He can promote and He can demote.<br><br>Never forget that God always has a substitute ready. You can never hold God to ransom. If He promotes you and you think that without you, He cannot do anything, He would just bring in the substitute. For over a decade, King Saul was still on the throne, but David had already being chosen and anointed king. Saul was merely carrying the title but David was the approved king. Right in the house of Eli, little Samuel was already rising – the one who would take over was already there, in waiting.<br><br>My prayer is that God will promote you, but don’t forget that when He does, you must put Him first and obey Him completely. You must help others and never use your position to oppress people. Proverbs 22:22-23 says God Himself will plead the case of those who oppress others. Let your promotion birth promotion for many other people too.<br><br>Perhaps you are the one resisting God’s promotion by indulging in one sin or the other.

      "God never does anything without a purpose. He promotes people primarily to fulfill His purpose. God promotes men so that they can use their promotion to serve and bless others. A tree does not consume its own fruit; it produces fruit for others to benefit from. You don’t become fruitful just for yourself, but rather, so that you can be of service to others.<br><br>According to Exodus 2:11-15, Moses was a fugitive. He was running away from Pharaoh because he had just committed murder, but by the time we get to Exodus 7:1, God said, “See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh…”. God promoted Moses so that he could deliver the nation of Israel. This is why, in Exodus 14:21-28, God could use Moses to clear a way through the Red Sea for the whole nation. 1 Samuel 16:11-13 tells us that when God wanted to appoint a king in his family, He chose the only one that nobody considered relevant – David. By the time He had promoted David, one of the reasons for his promotion came up in the next chapter – God used him to deliver a nation from a terrorist (1 Samuel 17:1-51).<br><br>When God promotes a man, it is so that he can help others fulfil their destiny. You can help others become who God wants them to be. This is why I don’t say a word when people criticize us for planting so many Churches, because a lot of people would never have discovered their purpose if they were not sent out. The purpose of God promoting you is to help others become what He planned for them. I pray that you will remember to help others fulfil their destinies when God promotes you.<br><br>The Bible says in Ezekiel 22:30 that God sought just one man who would stand between Him and the people so that He would not destroy their nation, but found none. Maybe God is waiting to promote you. If you are willing to help others, God will find you worthy of promotion.",

      "One habit that seems to have crept into the Church recently, is that of showing off to other Church members. There are people who go to Church majorly to show off their new clothes or some other material possession. This is completely outside God’s plan for the Body of Christ. God’s original plan for the Church is for everyone to be united and have everything in common. The Bible says in Acts 2:46-47:<br><br><b>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</b><br><br>The reason the Church is not growing as fast as it should is that there is no singleness of heart. When people prefer to outshine one another in showing off their material possessions than actually caring about each other and the gospel, the Church cannot grow. The reason we have not won the whole world to Christ is that the Church is not united.<br><br>The Holy Spirit does not move in the midst of divided people. When the Holy Spirit descended in the Upper Room, the people were in one accord (Acts 2:1). Until Christians love each other and are in one accord, the Church cannot experience the move of the Holy Spirit as it should.<br><br>Many Church leaders wonder why the Holy Spirit is not moving as much as they expect, not knowing that the problem is in the divisions within the Church. Some pastors give special attention to the rich in the Church. Apostle James said in James 2:1-5 that you should not give the rich preferential treatment against those that are not so rich, or else you would become a judge with evil thoughts. It doesn’t matter how rich they are, they should not be praised for showing off in the Church, but rather, rebuked.<br><br>Believers should dress well and can own luxurious items. However, it is wrong to flaunt material possessions with the intent to oppress others. The Church must unite and cease to be a place where people compete to outshine one another over material possessions.",

Since I could not get answers from my pastors, I turned to God and He answered me.<br><br>The reason we don’t understand certain things in the word of God is in Isaiah 55:8-9:<br><br><b>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.

      "Basically, the reason we eat is so that we can have strength, good health and life. When I was younger, we had a slogan that said, “We eat to live, we don’t live to eat”. The regular meals we eat however, have some limitations. One of the limitations is that there is no one food that has all the nutrients in it, so no ordinary meal can give you all-round vitality. There is however one meal that gives life in abundance. It is the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ. Until you eat this meal, you have no life in you (John 6:53).<br><br>In Joshua 14:6-14, one of the people who ate the Passover meal, Caleb, said at the age of 85, “I am still as strong today as I was 45 years ago”. When you eat the Holy Communion, your strength is renewed; weakness becomes a stranger to your body. Some years ago, I went to hold a programme in a foreign country, and during one of my prayer walks in the morning, I started feeling faint. I couldn’t walk much further and had to go back to my lodge. Later on, I recalled that we would be eating the Holy Communion that evening so that gave me hope. In the evening after eating the Communion, my strength came back to me. In Psalms 105:37, the Bible speaks about the children of Israel who ate the Passover meal: there was no feeble one amongst them. They all had robust health. Sickness will become a stranger to you when you eat this special meal. In John 6:54, the Lord Jesus Christ said concerning the Holy Communion:<br><br><b>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</b><br><br>We eat to live, have strength and be healthy, but the Holy Communion goes far beyond those three basic things. It acts as a medicine - not an ordinary kind of medicine, but one that defies death. Exodus 12:13 says death will pass over you when it sees the blood. This is the blood of Jesus which is represented by the wine in the Holy Communion. I am believing God for you that when next you eat the Holy Communion, death will stay away from your home, in Jesus’ name.",

Sadly, those who are not ready to go through this process will miss out on the great promotion God has prepared for them.<br><br>When God chose Elisha to be the greatest prophet of his time, he was already a successful farmer from a well-to-do family and all of a sudden, he became homeless - an errand boy to a prophet who was in trouble with the king. God took him from his high state to a very low one and he submitted to the process.<br><br>When the Lord chose me, I was the acting Head of the Mathematics Department in University of Ilorin.

These are the kind of people God usually lifts up because He does not want anyone to take His glory. He does not want anyone thinking it was their achievements that made God choose them for promotion.<br><br>God chose Saul as the first king of Israel, even though the young man considered himself unworthy (1 Samuel 9:21).<br><br>When Saul disobeyed and God wanted to promote someone else to his position, He sent Samuel to anoint one of Jesse’s sons. When Samuel asked Jesse to bring all his sons, David was not summoned because he was considered the least important among his sons. Jesse obviously thought there was absolutely no way David could be chosen as king, but that was exactly the fellow that God chose. God does not choose those who think they are wise, He chooses the foolish. The moment you think you are the best man for the job, God actually sees you as the worst. You cannot succeed at any divine assignment by your own power and might but only by His Spirit (Zechariah 4:6).<br><br>Anytime I travel and have the opportunity to speak with ministers in any nation, they always have one thing that they want me to address and that is the lack of unity amongst them. I often explain to them that the challenge is not that they do not want to be united; rather, it is a question of who will be the leader once they are united? I often go further to say, “If you realise that God usually chooses the foolish one to be the head, you won’t want to be that fellow, because being the head makes it obvious to everyone that you must be the most foolish of them all!”.<br><br>Beloved, if you realise that God will only choose the weak, the base, then you won’t struggle for positions.

This was why he was helpless before Goliath while David who had been anointed to take his place defeated the giant. When you read 1 Samuel 18:7, you see from the song of the women and children that they had a higher regard for David than Saul even though Saul was still considered the king.<br><br>Now that it is clear that God is the one who promotes, the next question is Who are the people that God usually chooses for promotion? 1 Samuel 2:7-8 says:<br><br><b> The\xa0Lord\xa0maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

      "God created man in His own image so that he could have dominion (Genesis 1:26). This is why you’ll discover that there is no animal in the world that humans have not dominated - lions, elephants, giraffes and so on. Note however, that the man who really has dominion is the one who has control over himself. You can have dominion over animals, birds and everything in the sea, but if you don’t have dominion over yourself, you are like a broken down and unduly exposed city (Proverbs 25:28).<br><br>Let us consider some parts of your body you must have dominion over. 1 Peter 3:10 says if you want to live long and have a good life, tame your tongue - have dominion over it. The tongue is very powerful and difficult to tame (James 3:5-8) but you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you (Philippians 4:13).<br><br>The Bible also says you should have dominion over your stomach. Philippians 3:19 urges you not to let your belly become your god. If you say you have dominion over everything but can’t control your stomach, you can’t fast, then you have no dominion because you have a strange god living within you. The Yoruba elders say, “There’s no idol like the stomach; every day, it asks for a sacrifice”. You have to tame your stomach.<br><br>You must also have control over your sleep. For you to say you have dominion, you must be able to decide, “I am not sleeping tonight; I want to have a vigil”. Proverbs 6:9-11 says that if you don’t control how you sleep, you will experience ravaging poverty and lack.<br><br>You must have control over your body - your eyes, hands and so on. There are certain things you shouldn’t touch or look at, places you shouldn’t go to, kinds of music you shouldn’t listen to. If you want to finish your Christian race well, you must have dominion over your body (1 Corinthians. 9:24-27). ",

      "Anointing can be described as divine electricity. This description will help us understand how important anointing is. If a person is not pure, yet is anointed, the anointing will kill the fellow, because if you mishandle electricity, you will be electrocuted. Samson was highly anointed but spent time with harlots. A man of God who commits adultery has set himself up for destruction. In other words, the combination of anointing and sinfulness will produce a casualty while anointing with purity will produce great and long lasting results.<br><br>For example, Abraham’s anointing was that of prosperity (Genesis 22:17-18) and it was transgenerational because he trained his children in the way of the Lord (Genesis 18:19). Abraham became great, his son became very great and his grandson Jacob became exceedingly great. His great-grandson Joseph picked up the anointing and God used him mightily as well.<br><br>Christians need anointing to execute their respective divine assignments. You may have heard the story of two people who sang Psalms 23 – one a professional singer who sang beautifully and everybody clapped, the other,an old man who sang the same Psalms 23 and had everyone on their knees, worshipping God. One sang professionally, the other with anointing and their results were different. So if you are a chorister, you definitely need anointing. Psalms 24:3-4 tells us the kind of people who can stand in God’s presence; so ushers also clearly need anointing. Prayer warriors need anointing because Romans 8:26 says we pray with the help of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Our Lord Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost before He started off His ministry (Acts 10:38). If the Lord did not perform a single miracle until the Holy Spirit came upon Him, surely you need anointing too. ",

Exodus 15:26 says, <i>“If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee”</i>. If you make holiness your lifestyle, God can make it such that sickness will become a stranger to you. <br><br>Beyond making sure that you don’t fall sick again, my God is so generous that He can allow His healing virtue to start flowing through you. All these can be available to you under certain conditions. Firstly, you must be a child of God because healing is children’s meat (Matthew 15:21-28). My God is not a healing contractor; He only heals those who are His children. Once in a while, He could heal an unbeliever on credit, expecting the fellow to become a member of His family by accepting Jesus as his or her Lord and Saviour. If however, the fellow still refuses to become born again, then a worse sickness could follow (John 5:14). To get to the level of overflowing healing virtue by which you would be healing others, you must also have faith. Mark 16:17-18 says you must be a believer. With faith, lay hands on people who need healing and sooner than later, you would begin to see them being healed. ",

      "Anger is one major tool that the devil uses to destroy destinies. Everybody knows clearly that no one just gets angry for no reason, without any provocation. Ecclesiastes 7:9 says, <i>“Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools”.</i> In Numbers 20:1-12, Moses – who had been labouring for God for forty years and leading a very difficult set of people, lost his temper just before he got to the promised land and so didn’t enter into it. Watch it: anytime something is about to make you angry, quickly check yourself; the devil may be preparing to spring an attack.<br><br>Anger is very dangerous. There was a man whose only problem was anger. Whenever he got angry, he could do anything. He had just bought a brand new car, parked it in front of the house and was rejoicing when his son took something sharp and scratched it on the new car. This man saw it and out of anger, used the first thing he saw – a hammer, to smash his son’s hand. The boy screamed. Upon realising what he had done, the man rushed the boy to the hospital, where the doctor said the only solution was to amputate the boy’s fingers. The following day, he went to see the boy in the hospital and the boy said to him, “Daddy, when will my fingers grow again?” The man went back home with a very heavy heart. He then decided to go and check what the boy had written on the car anyway. The boy had written on the car, “Daddy, I love you”. The man was so devastated that he committed suicide.<br><br>Anger is temporary madness; that is why you hear people say, “I was mad with him” and they say it with pride. If you really want to fulfil your destiny, you have to deal with anger in your life.<br><br><b>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</b><br>Proverbs 16:32<br><br>Rule your spirit.

      "Many a time, people have something in their lives that they know is wrong, but say, “It’s not too bad”. By the time you say it is not too bad, it means it's already bad; you are just looking for an adjective to qualify ‘bad’<br><br>.In Genesis 9:20-25, Noah - that great man of God who survived the flood, must have had a habit of drinking just a little wine occasionally. Not too bad, right? However, one day, he took one cup too many and became drunk. When he woke up, he pronounced a curse on one of his three sons, saying that he would become a servant of servants. He cursed his own legacy. Worse still is the second man with this same habit – Lot. In Genesis 19:30-38; Lot had just been rescued from destruction, but he too had the habit of taking just a little wine occasionally. His two daughters got him drunk and made him sleep with them one after the other and he produced children by them. When you go through the Scriptures to see these two families that he produced, you wouldn’t want to end up like them. One set were the Moabites (Genesis 19:37) and the second were the Ammonites – a people so terrible that they ripped open a pregnant woman (Amos 1:13). See what God had to say about them in Zephaniah 2:9:<br><br><b>Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.</b><br><br>All these happened because Lot decided to drink just a ‘little wine’. Stop indulging your bad habits; stop justifying your evil actions. Don’t indulge in anything that is bad at all. Abstain from anything that does not glorify the Lord. Only then can your destiny really be secure in Christ. For some, it is secular music or unnecessary closeness to people of the opposite sex. That is all the devil needs to get you into fornication. Song of Solomon 2:15 says, <i>“Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.”</i>",

Today’s Bible reading says we must not be brought under the power of anything in this world then went further to show that food is temporary. Don’t let something temporary send you to permanent destruction in hell.How often do you fast? Jesus Christ Himself said in Matthew 17:21, <i>“Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting”.</i> There are problems and demons around you that will not leave except by fasting and prayer. One day in my village, just as I was about to have my favourite dish of pounded yam with combination okro soup, God said to me, “Don’t eat, you are to fast today”. I argued with Him and ate the food. Just as I finished eating, someone came to call me to pray for my sister who had gotten small pox. You don’t face smallpox with a belly full of pounded yam. I had to go stick my finger down my throat to throw up the food. Only then was I able to pray for my sister and she was healed.<br><br>When God asks you to fast, don’t disobey because He has His reasons and it is always for your good. I was never one to fast before. The first time somebody told me that I was to fast for three days and nights without food, I called him a murderer. However, God gave me victory over my belly. I started fasting and little by little, I went from three days to five days and on and on until I started fasting for over forty days and nights. Whenever I am about to start a fast, I mark the days from when the fast is to start to when it ends, point to my stomach and say, “Belly, as from that day, no more food for you until so and so day”. When you are on a fast, you’ll suddenly be more aware of food around you, but you must resist the temptation to eat and stay focused on your goal.",

There are many Christians who cannot go one day without food. If food controls you, then it is your god and it can destroy you.<br><br>Esau was one man who food controlled. He was so controlled by food that he sold his birthright for a plate of porridge. Jacob on the other hand was willing to stay without the porridge he had cooked in order to get something valuable for the fulfilment of his destiny (Genesis 25:29-34). If you check that Scripture closely, you will see that Jacob even added bread to the porridge he gave to Esau. He knew that the moment was a destiny-defining one, so he declared a fast for himself. Because of that seemingly simple transaction, Esau lost the blessing of his father and missed the chance to have the Israelites as his children. You may not know it, but sometimes when God asks you to fast, it is because He wants to give you a destiny-fulfilling encounter.<br><br>The primary purpose of food is just to give you strength. You are to eat to live, not live to eat. The Bible says that there is a due season to eat (Psalms 145:15). In other words, there are seasons when you should not be eating at all - when you should be fasting. Do you have such seasons planned into your year? Apostle Paul said he fasted often (2 Corinthians 11:27). Your fasting must be often. I have heard some preachers say that Jesus had already fasted for us when He was on earth so we don’t need to fast again. That is a big lie; read the Bible for yourself. Jesus said in Mark 2:19 that after His ascension, His disciples would fast. He has ascended, so we must fast. Don’t let food rob you of your God-ordained destiny.",

In Numbers 31:1-16, the people of Israel were indestructible because God was solidly behind them, but then the enemy decided to send beautiful ladies into their camp and the people of Israel began to fornicate. After that, the enemy did not need to do anything; it was God Himself who started destroying them. If you are lusting after someone you’re not married to, you had better save your destiny by staying away from such a person because that is the strategy of the devil to destroy you. There are many people suffering all manners of plagues because of fornication and adultery. Don’t be one of them.<br><br>If you are old enough for marriage, pray for God’s direction and go through the Church when you want to start your courtship with whomever God has led you to. You may say that is ‘old-school’ mentality, but that is what has kept some of us standing and on the right path of destiny for many decades. It is better to be old-school than to be destroyed. Let the Church be involved in your courtship and make sure that you and your spouse-to-be never meet in private places where you can commit sin.<br><br>There are many people who set themselves up to fall into fornication by being too close to the opposite sex or staying alone in private places with them. Once you notice that you are beginning to lust after someone, declare a fast immediately to kill that lust in your flesh.

      "From our memory verse for today, we see that God resists the proud. In other words, God opposes the proud. If the Almighty God is your opponent, how will you ever win? The major problem of proud people is that they don’t even know that they are proud. They call it other beautiful names like self-respect, self-confidence, or they say ‘I am just honouring my position”. Saul was asking Samuel to honour his position in 1 Samuel 15:30 when he lost his throne. David on the other hand danced like a commoner even as king and was mocked by his own wife. He told her, “I am dancing for the One who made me king in the place of your father”(2 Samuel 6:16-21).<br><br>During praise and worship, you will know who is proud and who is not. Look at children; because they aren’t seeking to protect any position or anything like that, they just praise God, dancing the best way they can. During a service we held in one of the Universities in Nigeria, the Vice Chancellor danced even more than the students. God looked down from heaven and saw that, so when some weeks later the enemy rose up to remove him, the Lord of hosts fought on his behalf and gave him victory. When you humble yourself, God fights your battles for you.<br><br>After one of the biggest programmes we ever held - tagged Lekki ’98, I got back to the Camp and that night during my prayer walk, between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., I suddenly heard God say “Son, bend down and draw the figure of a man in the sand”. I drew the figure and then He said, “Stand up and wipe out what you have drawn with your foot”. I did that, and then He said, “Son, if you ever forget who is in charge, I will wipe you out and nobody will ever remember you came into the world”. It does not matter how high God has taken you, He can bring you down with the snap of His fingers.

That means if the devil wants to bring a great man down, he does not have to bother himself sending witches and wizards to that man; all he has to do is bring out the pride in the man. Proverbs 25:27 says:<br><br><b>It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</b><br><br>Seeking glory for yourself will not bring you glory but shame. Stop seeking people to lift you on their shoulders as if you are the best thing to have come into the world; humble yourself. The devil was once a very special arch-angel in heaven, but pride got into his head because of how beautiful he was. He started seeking glory for himself, even the glory of God’s own throne. He ended up being brought so low that, at the end of time, he will be locked up in the pit of fire to suffer forever.<br><br>The prescription of God for every Christian is to prefer others above yourself in honour. Romans 12:10 says, “Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another”.<br><br>The day you forget that everything you have is given to you by God is the day you begin to decline. Nebuchadnezzar was warned in Daniel 4:24-27 like I am warning you now, but he didn’t heed the counsel.

Matthew 27:39-44 says people that were passing by were saying, <i>“He saved others; himself he cannot save”.</i> Though he had the power to call for angels to rescue Him, He chose to endure the ridicule so that you and I can have a chance of spending eternity in Heaven.

      "In Luke 4:13-20, Jesus read from Scripture the reason He came to the earth as prophesied in Isaiah 61:1-3. There is however, one surprising thing in that Scripture: He started reading the prophesy of Isaiah about His ministry from the beginning, but when He got to the part that says ‘to preach the acceptable year of the Lord’, He stopped and closed the book. That was not all that Isaiah said; there was more, but in announcing the assignment that He had come to do on earth, Jesus stopped halfway. There must have been a reason for this. We see that reason in Acts 1:8:<br><br><b>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</b><br><br>Jesus came to the world, lived and died, then sent us the Holy Spirit so that we can continue from where He stopped. The first part of His assignment was fulfilled while He was on earth; the rest, as prophesied by Prophet Isaiah, is to be fulfilled through us His children after we have received the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Jesus saved you so that He can use you to save others. The question is: are you a ready vessel or not? As you celebrate Easter, don’t forget the assignment the Lord gave to you after He rose from death (Matthew 28:19-20).<br><br>Does Christ truly have you as a vessel to fulfil His will? Apostle Paul was a man who stopped at nothing to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ. Easter is not a time to just eat chicken and stay at home relaxing; it’s a time to go out there and let Jesus use you to save unbelievers. It’s a time to proclaim the day of the vengeance of God and to comfort all those who mourn.<br><br>Let Jesus use you to win at least one soul this season. Tell someone about the day of the vengeance of God and don’t let that fellow end up in hell.",

      "Your biggest enemy is not the devil, neither is it your mother-in-law, witches nor wizards. As a child of God, you know very well that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). The Bible made it clear that you are more than conquerors through Him that loved you (Romans 8:37).<br><br>Your number one enemy is yourself. The one who is truly victorious is the one who has conquered himself. When you live according to the dictates of your flesh, you give it permission to destroy you and it is good at doing that. <br><br><b>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</b><br>Proverbs 16:32<br><br>Samson took down an entire city single-handedly but could not conquer himself. He was so powerful that cities feared him, but in the lap of a woman, he was the weakest of men. Even a little child knows better than to touch a piece of hot iron that had burned him or her before. In Samson’s case however, he told Delilah a lie about the source of his power and awoke to find that she had used the information against him, yet he did not stay away from her. He told her another lie and she tried to exploit it and failed again, yet he did not stay away. To make matters worse, he told her the truth at last and ended up grinding corn for the same enemies that used to fear him (Judges 16:6-21). You may say Samson was a fool, but what about you? Have you been staying away from those sins that easily beset you?<br><br>When a child of God is really fervent, the devil starts searching out his weakness. The moment he finds it, he will try to use it as a weapon for that child of God to destroy himself or herself. That is why you must destroy that weakness before the devil uses it against you. Proverbs 25:28 says, <i>“He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls”.</i>Control yourself so that you would be victorious against the attacks of the devil.",

      "To further our discussion from yesterday on the dangers of fighting against God, let us look at what happens when you are fighting on His side.<br><br>When you decide to fight on the side of God, no matter how big or strong your enemy is, you will win. It doesn’t matter if you are fighting against enemies within your household or those outside - as long as you are on the side of God, they cannot defeat you.<br><br>The beautiful thing about standing on somebody’s side is that the fellow is also standing beside you, so if any enemy sends an arrow to you, such a person is also sending the arrow to God. That is why no weapon fashioned against you can prosper (Isaiah 54:17). When you are on God’s side, no enemy can defeat you.<br><br>In 1 Samuel 17:34-37, David talked about how he had killed a lion and a bear and that he would also kill Goliath because God was with him. King Saul then said to him, “Go, and the Lord be with you”. The boy defeated Goliath with just a stone because God was on his side and he was on God’s side (1 Samuel 17:44-50).<br><br>In Joshua 10:1-14, God was on Joshua’s side because Joshua was on His side. Joshua stopped the sun so that he could defeat all his enemies. When you fight the battle of life on God’s side, victory is sure. It doesn’t matter what comes your way, greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). Jesus Christ assured us in John 16:33:<br><br><b>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</b><br><br>Jesus has overcome the world, so your victory is guaranteed once you are on His side and the first step to ensuring this is to surrender your life to Him.

      "Sequel to the discussion we started yesterday, the side you take determines who you fight against. If you take the side of God, you would be fighting against the devil and his demons. If you disobey the Lord, then you have chosen the side of the devil and would thus be fighting against God. Believe me honestly, you don’t want to fight God. He is too big for you to take sides against and survive.<br><br>God has His way of dealing with people who take sides with the devil through disobedience to Him. One way is to withdraw His support from such a fellow like He did in Joshua 7:1-12 when Joshua failed because he had accommodated sin in his camp. Another way is to completely forsake the fellow like He did Samson in Judges 16:18-31. There are many people experiencing either of these today but they don’t realise that it is God fighting them so they keep fighting without realising that the One they are battling against cannot be defeated.<br><br>There was a lawyer who once told me that tithing was just a means for pastors to collect people’s hard-earned money. I tried to explain to him that tithing was a commandment from God but he refused to listen, so I said to him: “May I ask God to prove by Himself through you if tithing is His will or not?” He replied, “Pray the prayer” so I did. This brilliant lawyer lost all the three cases he handled immediately after this incident. This tarnished his reputation and he lost some business. This man also owned a bakery and suddenly, during a festive period when most bakeries record higher demand and sales, all his bakers decided to resign from their jobs. He offered to double their salaries but they all insisted that they were leaving. Hard as he tried, he couldn’t get new bakers. After he realised that this must be God fighting him, he came to me and said, “I agree now that tithing is God’s will; please pray for me”. We prayed a simple prayer; he appealed the three cases he had lost and won all of them. His bakers also returned to work with him and everything became good again.<br><br>Beloved, disobeying God amounts to fighting Him and woe unto him that fights his Maker (Isaiah 45:9).",

      "Human beings are faced with all kinds of wars from their conception all through to the day they leave this earth. Genesis 38:27 says that when a woman is in labour, she is travailing. After she puts to bed, the child begins to confront all kinds of enemies – known and unknown. In Matthew 10:36, Jesus Christ Himself said a man’s foes will be they of his own household. If the Lord showed you all the relatives and family friends who wanted you to die in infancy, it would surprise you, but thank God you survived.<br><br>When we talk about household enemies, it could be your father or even your mother. If you don’t believe that parents can be their children’s enemies, read Genesis 27, where you will see how a mother plotted against her own son and denied him of his blessings.<br><br>I have always wondered about when God told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac to Him and Isaac asked where the lamb for the sacrifice was. Instead of his father telling him the truth, he said, “God will provide”. Isaac must have looked around, shocked as his father was tying him up, thinking, “So I am the ram?”<br><br>What about in-laws? Read 1 Samuel 18:29 and you will see a man – King Saul, being described as the enemy of his son-in-law – David. That is not to talk about witches and wizards, principalities and powers et cetera (Ephesians 6:12). In this warfare, there are two different hosts fighting for the souls of men. You can either decide to take sides with the heavenly host or the demonic hosts - you cannot be neutral. What determines the side you pick are your actions and inactions. If you pick the side of God, then you will stay away from sin and cling to Jesus Christ daily (Luke 9:23); you will pray, study your Bible, witness and do all that He requires of you daily. Those who pick the devil’s side live according to the dictates of their flesh and commit sin. For those who stay away from sin, they will end up victorious and make it to heaven at the end (Revelation 3:5), while those who commit sin will end up in the lake of fire with the devil and his demons (Matthew 25:41).

I returned to Lagos thinking that I was super-charged, but in two weeks, I had three accidents! I realised there was no protection in the amulets and threw them into the lagoon.

One of those meanings is that before anything that exists now ever existed, the Word was already existing. In other words, He saw the beginning of everything else since all things were made by Him (John 1:3)<br><br>The day you dedicate your new house, that is the beginning of your dwelling in that house, but the day you laid the foundation of the house was also another beginning. When the architect began to draw the plan of the house was another beginning while the day you – the Landlord – conceived the idea to build a house was also another beginning all together.<br><br>Humanly speaking, the day your Father and mother met together to produce you is another beginning of the house, because if you were not born, you would not have thought of building that house. Jeremiah 1:4-5 says that before God formed you, He knew you. Thus that house of yours started in the mind of God long before you were born. God had in His plan a house that you were going to build even before you were born. Thus, no matter what it is that exists, it has its root in God. This is good news for children of God because since He was in the beginning of everything and everything was made by Him, then everything is controlled by Him – The Word. Therefore, when you simply speak the word of God into any situation, you gain control over it.<br><br>Before the mountains were brought forth, He has been God (Psalms 90:1-2). This is why Mark 11:22-24 says that if you have faith, you can speak to any mountain and it will move. For example, if the mountain of sickness wants to bring you down, you uproot it with the word of God in Isaiah 53:5 that by Jesus’ stripes you are healed. If it is the mountain of failure, then you uproot it with the word in Deuteronomy 28:13 that says you shall be the head and not the tail.

      "Many a time when God allows a mountain to stand in your way, it is because He wants to showcase you to the world. He uses your victory over the mountain to show the world His investments in your life. In 1 Samuel 17:1-51, when Goliath was marching up and down, terrorising the nation of Israel, God was advertising the mountain so that everyone would see how big it was. At the time Goliath was boasting, nobody knew David yet. Nobody knew that anointing had already come on a little boy from an ordinary home; nobody knew that there was a teenage boy who had killed a lion and a bear with his bare hands. God was about to present him to the whole world. Thank God David did not run away from his mountain that day because by the time he was standing on Goliath’s dead body, lifting his severed head, everybody knew he was someone special.<br><br>I pray God will use the mountain before you as an opportunity to showcase His glory upon your life to the whole world in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Matthew 5:16 says, <i>“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven”</i>. God derives glory when His children shine their lights and displace darkness brought about by mountains. When there is a problem in your office, it may be the opportunity God has designed to showcase you in that office or industry. When there is a crisis in your family, that could be God’s arrangement to show everyone in the family that He has an anointed child in their midst and to draw them to Himself. Don’t shy away from the problem, face it and solve it.<br><br>From our Bible reading today, we saw Joseph was already interpreting dreams as a prisoner before he got the opportunity to interpret the king’s dream, which led to God showcasing him to the whole world.<br><br>You must diligently and consistently develop yourself so that the day God decides to showcase you to the world; you will be prepared and equipped to overcome the mountain by His grace.",

      "While it is true that God can solve all problems, when you go closer to Him, you would realise that once in a while, He allows some mountains (problems) to stand in your way. The good thing however, is that if He allows the mountain to stand in your way, it is because He knows you can climb it. For example, in Job’s case, God only allowed what He knew Job could overcome. 1 Corinthians 10:13 says that God will not permit us to be tempted beyond our capacity and He would always provide a way of escape as well.<br><br>Sometimes, God allows mountains in the life of His children because he or she is about to be promoted. Before every promotion, there is always an exam that the fellow who is to be promoted must pass. No teacher will give Advanced-level questions to primary school students in an exam. God will not give you an examination greater than your capacity to overcome.<br><br>In Daniel 3, after all the horrors of going into the fiery furnace, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were promoted. Job 42:12-16 tells us that at the end of Job’s test, his latter end was far superior to his beginning.<br><br>When God allows mountains to stand in the path of His children, He also gives them the required measure of grace to deal with those mountains. The unfortunate thing is that many times, people refuse to use that grace and they just let the temptation take over their lives. There is always a way of escape, no matter how small; you just have to hold on to it so that you can overcome. This is where you need the fruit of the Spirit called, ‘Longsuffering’. Don’t look for alternatives to God simply because you are facing a mountain. Don’t commit sin in a bid to get rid of that mountain because sin will only bring a bigger mountain your way.<br><br>Hold on to God like Job did.

      "As opposed to the people who don’t have ears that we discussed yesterday, there are many who do have ears but are too paralysed to practice what they learn from the word of God. They can recall the Pastor’s sermon word for word but they don’t practice it. They can probably even recite the Bible from Genesis to Revelation but it does not show in their lives because they do nothing in line with the word.These category of people are described in 2 Timothy 3:7 as:<br><br><b>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</b><br><br>These are people who learn but somehow, the word does not take root in them enough for it to change their character. The devil practically paralyses them and stops them from doing what they have learnt. If you are in this category, I declare your freedom today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>One way the devil paralyses people after they have heard the word is through procrastination. They hear and are determined to apply what they have learnt, but then they procrastinate until they lose the zeal to do it. The day my Father-in-the-Lord taught us that worldly music attracts evil spirits while godly music repels them and attracts the Holy Spirit, I destroyed all the worldly music tapes that I had.

Revelations 2:7 says, <i>“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches…”</i><br><br>There is danger in not hearing the word of God because Isaiah 6:8-10 says if you can hear, then you will repent and be healed. That is why the devil puts in all efforts to steal the word of God from our hearts as we see in our Bible reading for today. I am certain that the day you gave your life to Christ, you were not the only one who heard that message. Others heard it and many of them did not surrender their lives to Christ. This is because though they had ears physically, the devil had blocked their spiritual ears. Furthermore, there are a lot of Christians who have been going to Church for many years; the Pastor preaches powerful sermons, but it has had no effect on their lives because the devil has simply blocked their ears in order to keep them in bondage. I pray your spiritual ears will never be blocked, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There are also people who practice selective hearing of the word of God. In their case, the devil doesn’t have to bother himself, they block their own ears themselves (Jeremiah 17:23). They don’t want to hear that passage of the Bible that will condemn what they are doing wrong. When such people hear me say, “God said we should be holy for He is holy” they say, “Doesn’t he have anything else to say”?<br><br>Psalms 95:6-8 made it clear that if you want to hear God’s voice, “Harden not your heart”. Some of us have hardened our hearts; we don’t want to hear anymore. Remember the rich man’s plea in Luke 16:19-31 when he told Abraham to send Lazarus to preach to his brothers. Abraham told him that his brothers had prophets speaking to them on earth; if they didn’t listen to them, they wouldn’t hear anyone else.

      "One of the most beautiful things about the word of God is that it produces faith. Romans 10:17 says, <i>“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”</i> The word helps faith to swell within you, so much so that you begin to do things that were impossible for you before. Daniel 11:32 says, <i>“… but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits”.</i><br><br>The more of God you know, the stronger you become and the more exploits you can do for Him. There is just something powerful that consumes you when you study your Bible; you begin to see through the eyes of God. You would start to see situations as God sees them. You would become bold and fearless. Things that were impossible to you before would become normal; in fact, you would experience some miracles that would be difficult to testify of as people would find it difficult to believe you.<br><br>If you can eat the word of God so much that you are filled with it, then Jesus Christ said you can ask Him for anything and He would do it (John 15:7). What a great open secret! If you have been wondering why God answers some people’s prayers speedily, now you know what to do. Hebrews 11:6 says:<br><br><b>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</b><br><br>Since faith comes by hearing the word of God and it is impossible to please God without faith, you need the word of God to please Him. If you are like me, always crying to God, saying, “Lord, I just want to please You”, the solution is simple: soak yourself in the word of God.<br><br>It is interesting though that fear also comes by hearing so be careful of what you listen to. <br><br>Choose to listen to the word of God.

Though he had become a fugitive and it seemed he had missed it in life, Moses got a chance for a new beginning the moment he started hearing from God. In John 11:39-44, when Jesus Christ was going to bring Lazarus back from the dead, He didn’t lay hands on him; He only spoke and a new beginning came for someone who had been dead for 4 days. I speak the word of God into your life now: receive a new beginning, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Word of God is not only all-powerful but also sharp - sharp enough to separate the joint from the marrow and even dividing the soul and spirit of a man (Hebrews 4:12). When you see a hardened criminal crying in front of the altar to give his life to Christ, that is an example of what the Word of God can do. It can pierce into the hardest of souls. That is why it is futile trying to change your stubborn relatives using your own words. Preach the word of God to them; pray that the Word pierces through their souls to convict them of their sins.<br><br>Someone once said that they were wondering how come we usually have such large crowds at our crusades. They wondered especially because my sermons at such crusades were usually simple and the general theme was always: “Be holy”, yet large crowds attend over and over again and thousands give their lives to Christ every time I make an altar call. I told them it is because beautiful sermons with analysis of the Bible using Greek and Hebrew languages do not convict sinners. Deep thoughts and philosophies can’t convert anyone without the power of the Holy Spirit. Simple and straightforward as the word of God is, it has tremendous power to convert sinners to saints.<br><br>If you are a preacher of the gospel, please don’t try to impress the people with how much Greek and Hebrew you know.

      "From our Bible reading, we can clearly see that the Word is Jesus Christ (John 1:14). The Word is extremely powerful. If you can know and be filled with the Word, then there is nothing that would be impossible to you.<br><br>If you meet someone and the fellow is introducing himself to you, he is likely to tell you what he does. For example, a Civil engineer will most likely introduce himself as one. In getting to know the Word also, you must first know what the Word does. According to John 1:1-3, the Word is the Creator of all things. Is there anybody who can duplicate the sun, moon, seas, or the human brain? Do you know that it is the Word that created you? To prove that all His creations are masterpieces, He put a unique code in your fingerprints such that no other creation of His is exactly like you. Someone else may have the same height, looks and complexion as you, but no two people are exactly the same. He made you unique for a purpose and you will fulfil that purpose in Jesus’ name.<br><br>When you see a masterpiece, it is usually extremely valuable, so valuable that no one can place a price on it and it’s thus often auctioned to the highest bidder. Matthew 16:26 says that your soul is so precious that even if all the riches in this world were to be put in a bid for your soul, there still wouldn’t be enough value for it. That is why I marvel when I see people selling their soul to the devil for material wealth. Such people are selling themselves short. The only price that is worth being paid for your soul is the blood of the Lord Jesus – the Word Himself. He has shed His blood and paid the price for you to be with Him for eternity.<br><br>Some sell their souls to the devil because they are lusting after a woman. Some sell their souls by telling lies so as not to get in trouble with men. There is nothing the world and the devil has to give that can be as valuable as your soul. Don’t sell yourself short to the enemy, the Word has already purchased you with His priceless blood.",

      "If the richest man in the world gave you $100 and then later tells you to give him the money because he needs it for something, you are likely to give him immediately because he was the one who gave you the money in the first place and you know that he can give you even much more again. This is why I am surprised when I see people who refuse to pay their tithes. The fellow who is asking you to bring 10% is the One who gave you the 100% in the first place. He even promised you in Malachi 3:10 that if you give Him 10% of whatever He blesses you with, He will pour down a blessing so big that it would be difficult for you to contain it, yet you refuse to give Him the 10%; whose loss is it?<br><br>In Hebrews 11:17-19, the Bible says that when Abraham obeyed God by taking Isaac to the mountain to be sacrificed, it was because he got him from God in the first place and knew that if his son died, the Lord who gave Isaac to him could raise him from the dead. Abraham knew that he did not produce the boy, so offering him back to the One who produced him was not difficult. It is the same with Hannah after she had Samuel and took him back to God (1 Samuel 1:24-28).<br><br>In all the cases where God asked someone for something and the fellow obeyed, God ended up giving the fellow more than He had asked for. It is obvious then that He is not really interested in what He asked you to do, but rather in your obedience. God is very particular about obedience; if He asks you to give your car to somebody and you refuse, but bought another car for the fellow, you would have missed the mark. He is not as interested in your sacrifices as in your obedience. 1 Samuel 15:22 says,<br><br><b>…Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</b><br><br>God’s instructions are tough sometimes, but when you think about it carefully and realise that He owns everything you have, it becomes easy to obey Him. Don’t become like King Saul who forgot his origin and ended up in disgrace - the same disgrace he was trying to avoid when he disobeyed God.",

We looked through the Saturdays for the rest of that year and even the one after, but could only find one free in July the next year. She said, “Glory be to God; that is the date of my wedding”. The next year came and my mother died in July, while I was in London on an assignment and because I hadn’t written the lady’s marriage appointment in my calendar, my wife saw that Saturday free in my calendar and said, “Yes, this is when we will bury Mama”. <br><br>I loved my mother very much - I am her last born and only son, but because of how committed this lady was to having me at her wedding, I couldn’t let her down. There was no other free day so I decided that we would do the funeral on Friday so that I could attend the wedding on Saturday.<br><br>When God sees a committed fellow, when He sees someone that will do anything to fulfil His will, He will also be committed to that person. Abraham’s heart was totally committed to God - so committed that he was willing to sacrifice his son just to fulfil God’s will.

The waiter ensures the guest sits comfortably then proceeds to take his or her order. The waiter then ensures the order is delivered promptly and exactly as specified by the guest.<br><br>Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 6:13, <i>“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”</i> Having done everything you know to do before God, stand. Once you are serving Him, winning souls, following up on them, paying your tithes, giving your offerings, honouring Him with your first fruits and all else you know to do, according to His word, the only thing left is to stand. You are to wait on Him, asking “Lord, what else do you want me to do?”. The moment you get an answer, jump into action.<br><br>When those who wait on the Lord go to Him in prayers, they pray the way He would want them to: they pray His word back to Him. Since it is His word, He will answer it. They don’t pray only just when they feel like it; many times, they feel Him nudging them to pray even when they do not feel like. Those who wait on the Lord don’t seek their own pleasure in life; all they want is to please their Master. If God tells them, “I need all the money in your bank account for this project” they don’t hesitate; they drop the money immediately. They are always at His beck and call, willing and eager to do His bidding.<br><br>Now, when you have had a very good waiter attend to you at a restaurant, you are likely to drop a tip for the fellow. The tip that God gives you in return for waiting on Him, according to Isaiah 40:31, is that He will renew your strength. This means that sickness and even old age will not have power over you. He will become your doctor, taking care of you by Himself. Also, He will give you wings to fly like an eagle. In other words, you will be in a class of your own. Great men will call you great. You will excel so much in all you do that it will be difficult for anybody to beat your record. Commit to waiting on God from today, He rewards all those who diligently seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).",

      "The presence of the Most High God is the best place anyone can be in. Those who spend time in His presence are always in control of life’s situations rather than the other way round. Elijah was just coming from the presence of God in 1 Kings 17 when he commanded that there should be no rain or dew for three years and it was so. If you want to be in control, then what you really need is to be in God’s presence. It’s a good thing we have the criteria required for you to be in God’s presence listed in our Bible reading for today. They are as follows:<br><br>1.You must have clean hands. In 2 Corinthians 6:17, God said: <i>“Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.”</i> You have to be careful what you touch with your hands. I’ve always told my children to be careful what they sign. If a report is wrong or misleading, don’t append your signature. Don’t steal, don’t manipulate reports; watch what your hand touches.<br><br>2. Your heart must be pure. Matthew 5:8 says: <i>“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”</i>Be careful of what you let into your heart and what you meditate upon if you truly want to dwell in His presence.<br><br>3. Your heart must not be lifted up to vanity. Colossians 3:1-3 says: <i>“If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”</i> You must regularly check what motivates you to do what you do. Are you driven by material or spiritual things? 1 John 2:15 says you should not love the world or things of the world, that if you love the world then the love of the Father is not in you.<br><br>4.You must not be a liar. Revelation 22:15 made it clear: <i>“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.”</i>If you are a liar or someone who takes part in the benefits of other people’s lies, God will keep you outside His presence.",

In Matthew 22:1-14, a king went through the crowd of guests at his son’s wedding and saw a man who wasn’t wearing clothes suitable for a wedding and so commanded that the man be kicked out.<br><br>I was talking to a relative who was always dressing like people of the world. I said, “You belong to a special family. The enemies are looking at us; if they want to attack, they will look for someone who is among us but different from us. You’re the only one standing out. If they decide to attack, they will find it easy to pick on you”. That changed the person’s mind completely.<br><br>Finally, you remember the story of Blind Bartimaeus in Mark 10:46-52. When he was told that Jesus was calling on him, the first thing he did was throw away his garment. He was saying, in essence, “I will never dress like a beggar again; I’m not going to beg again, I’m not going to be in sorrow again, I’m not going to be in darkness again.” When you give your life to Jesus Christ, there should be a change of garments.<br><br>In Mark 5:25-34, the woman with the issue of blood said, “I just want to touch the hem of his garment”.

      "Jesus said in Mark 16:15, <i>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel…”</i> This is an express command to all disciples of Jesus Christ. From the scripture above, it is clear that all followers of Jesus have been assigned to preach the word but you may then ask, “Who should we preach to?” Jesus also provided the answer in the concluding part of the verse above. He said His followers are to preach to ‘every creature’ and in Matthew 28:19-20 He also said, <i>“Preach the gospel to all nations”.</i><br><br>You may then ask, “When should I preach the word?” The Holy Spirit answered this question through Paul’s second letter to Timothy as we see in our memory verse today. The word of God should be preached at all times. In other words, we must preach the word when it is convenient and when it is inconvenient.<br><br>You may also wonder why Jesus commanded all His disciples to preach the word to every creature and all the nations of the world. Romans 10:13-15 provides a clear answer:<br><br><b>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</b><br><br>It is God’s desire to save the whole world from sin and eternal damnation – but how will everyone hear the gospel if there are no preachers? Jesus Christ said that the harvest is plenteous but the labourers are few (Matthew 9:37). Sign up today to become a vibrant co-labourer with the Lord and you will begin to experience divine signs and wonders in your life.Indeed, the feet of those who preach the gospel are beautiful (Romans 10:15) and he who wins souls is wise (Proverbs 11:30).If you have not accepted Jesus as your Lord and saviour, please do so right away so you can also join in spreading the gospel of God’s salvation to every creature on earth.

      "There are many great leaders in this world. However, there is Someone called the Most High, the Almighty (Psalms 91:1). He is higher than the highest (Ecclesiastes 5:8). Isaiah 66:1 says heaven is His throne and the earth is His footstool. According to Revelation 19:16, He is the King of kings. Put in modern terms, He is the President of all the presidents in the world.<br><br>The Most High God rules in the affairs of men (Daniel 4:25). In Daniel 4:34-35, the king of the country considered as the superpower in the world at that time confessed that the dominion of the Most High is forever. Thus, once in a while, when one earthly leader or the other is beginning to feel big and in control, God teaches the fellow a lesson and shows the whole world that He is still in control. God demonstrated through the Coronavirus pandemic that despite the sophistication of the leaders of the world, they are powerless without Him and so they must surrender to His Lordship.<br><br>Proverbs 21:1 says He is the one who controls the heart of kings like rivers of water. When an earthly king is beginning to prove stubborn and refuses to bow to His Lordship, He can deal with the fellow in one of two ways. The first is by shifting something in the king’s brain so that he would begin to act like an animal. After a while, when he has learnt his lesson and really seen who is in charge, God would then restore his sound mind and He may even restore his throne too. This is what happened to Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4:30-37. The second way that the Most High can deal with such a king is to harden his heart and then destroy him, using him as an example to the whole world that He is still sovereign. This is what happened to Pharaoh in Exodus 15:4-6. <br><br>Something similar happened in Nigeria a few years ago when a military head of state was acting as if he owned the country, killing people and doing as he pleased. When his cup became full, God removed him permanently.<br><br>If you find yourself in a leadership position, don’t let it get into your head; always remember God is the one truly in charge.",

In other words, he is empowered to use that sword if you do wrong. Our experience when the Coronavirus pandemic started clearly showed the power of those in authority like never before. For example, when the government declared a lockdown, everyone was more or less automatically placed under house arrest. God gave them that much power. It doesn’t matter whether you are the most anointed fellow around - you must obey them because the One who anointed you is the same Person who put them in power.<br><br>What will we Christians look like if we always disobey constituted authority? Do you think our Heavenly Father wants the whole world to see His children as stubborn and unruly people? If anyone would disobey authority, it should not be Christians because the very essence of Christianity itself is in holiness, that is, complete obedience. When a businessman who is also a Pastor is the very one doctoring figures and evading taxes, would he be able to preach the gospel to the tax officials who discover his crime? When people see you throwing trash on the street or running a red light, what image are you painting to them of your Father? Believe me honestly, when you disobey constituted authority, you have disobeyed God, so when the authority uses their sword on you, God will not come to your rescue.

      "There are many people living substandard lives because they don’t balance their spiritual and physical lives. Many Christians do everything spiritual; they pray, study their Bibles, are wonderful workers in the Church, evangelise and so on, but then, ignore diligence in the workplace, the need to eat healthy, and the need to build a good connection with their family members. At the end of the day, they are not pleased with how their lives are and they sometimes wonder why God is not magically making everything right. While you must do all that God expects you to do to be fit spiritually, you must not neglect what you need to do to be fit physically as well. Galatians 6:7 says, <i>“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”</i><br><br>If you neglect your health, do not be surprised when you fall ill. If you sow disregard for your wife/husband and children, you would naturally reap disregard from them too. If you sow lack of diligence in your workplace, poverty would follow (Proverbs 6:10-11). What you sow in the spiritual, you will reap just as you will also reap what you sow in the physical.<br><br>Our memory verse tells of God’s wish for our prosperity, good health and spiritual growth. The case of those who put all their attention on the physical and neglect the spiritual is however, worse. For many of such people, they begin the fire brigade approach of fasting and praying for that specific problem, but may not get the desired answers because there are some things that only answer to a Father-child relationship with God (Matthew 15:26).<br><br>The kind of life that God wants you to live is one where there is a balance between the spiritual and the physical - one where you can live a fulfilled life here on earth and then spend eternity in heaven when you leave the earth.

That conclusion is not in line with the story. When you study that passage very well, you would see that the rich man pleaded for Lazarus to go back to earth to preach to his brothers but; Father Abraham responded that if his brethren did not listen to the prophets, they would not listen to Lazarus either. It is therefore clear that it is not wealth that sent the rich man to hell, but rather his refusal to listen to the prophets.<br><br>John 3:1-16 shows clearly that the way to make it to heaven is to be born again. It doesn’t matter whether you are rich or poor; if you are not born again, you are going to spend eternity in the lake of fire. You can be the richest person in the world and go to heaven if you are born again; you can be the poorest fellow in the world and go to hell if you refuse to surrender your life to Jesus.<br><br>Proverbs 10:22 states clearly that the blessing of the Lord maketh rich and addeth no sorrow.

So many times, I start projects not because I have the funds required to complete them, but because I know that God will ‘catch me’ and He has never failed.

      "There are many people in the Church who look at the Pastor as if God cannot use them similarly. They think that they cannot heal the sick or even raise the dead, but this is very far from the truth. Maybe you feel so because you believe that you cannot make the same sacrifices that the Pastor makes, especially in fasting and prayers, but that is also not true. Zechariah 4:6 says, <i>“… Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts”.</i><br><br>Praying for 12 hours nonstop would be generally impractical unless the Holy Spirit helps the person. It is the same Holy Spirit in you that is helping those you look up to, spend so much time fasting and praying to the extent that they carry such great anointing. Your willingness and total surrender to God are the major determinants of how much God can use you. Willingness means that if you decide to fast for 7 days and by the 2nd day, your stomach is protesting, rather than break the fast, you would go to God in prayer for grace to continue. If you plan to pray in tongues between 9 pm and 11 pm every day, but you get home very late and tired one day – rather than sleeping off by 9 pm, you’ll still fall on your knees and compel yourself to pray.<br><br>I have always found the story of John Mark very interesting. Acts 15:37-40, tells how this young man - full of zeal, followed Paul and Barnabas on a missionary trip, but got to the mission field and, seeing how difficult things were, especially seeing people stoning them, ran back home. Acts 15:38, Paul and Barnabas were about to go on another journey and Barnabas wanted John Mark to come with them, but Paul said, “No way, I’m not taking this deserter with me”. When you read 2 Timothy 4:11 however, this same Paul now said to Timothy, “Bring John Mark to me, he is useful to me for the ministry”. The Gospel according to Saint Mark is attributed to this same boy who failed on his first missionary journey.<br><br>No matter how weak you seem now, with God’s help, you also can become a pillar in His Kingdom.

      "Psalms 91:11-12 says the Lord will command His angels to carry you in their hands. Hebrews 1:13-14 tells us that angels are ministering spirits - in other words, they are sent to serve those who are children of God. When people ask, “Daddy, why are you travelling alone at night, don’t you know it is dangerous?” I tell them I have my own bodyguards, only that they cannot be seen - two huge fellows, each one capable of dealing with any amount of confrontations. Their names are Goodness and Mercy. As Psalms 23:6 says, Goodness and Mercy shall follow you all the days of your life.<br><br>The first time you see an angel, you would most likely be afraid, because they are very huge. They are also very powerful - so powerful that one angel can kill 185,000 soldiers in one night (2 Kings 19:35). Whether you believe it or not, the day you became born again, one of such big and powerful angels was assigned to follow you everywhere you go and to do whatever you want him to do in line with the will of God. Anytime your enemies think they have gotten you, your angel can come in the middle of the night to save you (Acts 5:17-25, Acts 12:5-11).<br><br>Now, you must understand that even though angels are assigned to serve you, you still need to give them instructions to follow. They are primarily subject to God’s instructions, so to instruct them, echo God’s word back to them and they will obey promptly. For example, God has already said that they will carry you so that you would not dash your foot against a stone (Psalms 91:12), this means that you can ask God to command them to clear any form of accident from your path before embarking on a journey. God said that if enemies gather against you in one way, they would flee in seven (Deuteronomy 28:7), so you can ask God to command angels to scatter the camp of your enemies.<br><br>You must understand though, that God’s word is only potent in the mouth of His children; if you are not born again, rather than angels obeying you, they can work against you. If you don’t believe me, ask Balaam (Numbers 22:21-35).",

If you are a child of God, you are part of the body of Christ and the body of Christ includes His feet. The biggest demon is under the feet of Jesus; you are therefore above the biggest demon. In John 14:13, Jesus said that if we ask for anything we want in His name, He would do it, that the Father may be glorified in Him. Philippians 2:9-11 says that He has a name that is above every other; that at His name, all knees should bow - whether those in heaven, on earth or underneath the earth. Mark 16:17 says, <i>“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues.”</i><br><br>When you cast out demons in Jesus’ name, they will flee, if you are truly born again. You must note however, that there are two types of demon-possessed people - unwilling victims (possessed by demons against their wish and desiring deliverance) and the willing. It is easy to deliver the unwilling because the host is in agreement with you to cast out the demon. For the willing victims however, they don’t want to be delivered and you cannot force them. The only thing you can do is to find a way to convince the fellow to seek deliverance. <br><br>One day, a man came to my office with his wife and said, “Daddy, my wife is a witch; please help me”. The woman retorted, “Don’t mind him, it is his mother who is a witch”. I responded, “No problem. I will pray a prayer that if you are not a witch, then you would just keep prospering, but if you are truly one, then I will bind that demon inside you so that it won’t be able to go out”. She said, “Go ahead and pray the prayer”. I prayed and they left. One month later, her husband brought her back to me; this time, she was all swollen, because the demon in her was trapped in her body. By then, she was ready to be delivered.<br><br>Take charge over every demon in your vicinity because as a child of God, you have the power to do so. ",

There are enemies that bodyguards cannot even see, not to talk of fight. Could your bodyguards have protected you from Coronavirus? In any case, even the best bodyguards sleep too. In our Bible reading for today, King Saul was sleeping and Abner - a warrior so mighty that even David respected him, was supposed to be guarding the king, but he fell asleep also. David came and on seeing them both sleeping, took the king’s spear and water bottle away. In the morning, he cried to the king and showed him that even with the best of bodyguards, he could have lost his life the previous night. No matter how many people you have guarding you, without God, you are not safe.<br><br>A few years ago, we had just finished the convention on a Sunday and that night, around 2 a.m., I went out, walking through the camp and thanking the Almighty God for what He had done. For a long while, I didn’t see a single guard. Finally I saw one sprawled on a chair, fast asleep. He had another chair beside him so I sat on it. In his effort to drive mosquitoes away while still sleeping, he nearly slapped me, so I got up and left. The second guard I saw was not even pretending - he spread out four chairs, removed his shoes and lay down. Now, even if they were awake, could they really prevent any evil from happening unless the Lord helps them? Indeed, except the Lord keeps a city, those who watch over it do so in vain (Psalms 127:1).<br><br>Thank God that we have a Father who never sleeps.

There is the demonic host - soldiers of Satan, with their officers (principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world as detailed in Ephesians 6:12). Finally, we have the human host - the armies of the world. The army, navy, air force, paramilitary and the likes are also called hosts.

For example, a brother shouldn’t be going alone on visitation to the house of an unmarried lady – this is a step towards sin. By the time he would be coming out of that place, anyone could later accuse him of fornication and it would be his word against theirs.<br><br>Sin usually starts like a harmless thing, but that is why the Bible says that the devil is wily - a trickster (Ephesians 6:11); if you yield to it because it seems harmless, you are already falling into his trap.

      "Beloved, I have one simple message for you today: Don’t write yourself off. In our memory verse for today, David told his soul to hope in the Lord and know that he would still praise God for His help. Any time you feel despair, any time you feel there is no hope, tell yourself, “No, I am not going to end like this; one day, I too will testify of the help of God in my life”.<br><br>Many years ago, when my wife and I just got married and things were tough, I would tell her, “Don’t worry, things won’t go on like this; our tomorrow will be all right” and indeed, God has been faithful. I am saying to you reading this devotional today: your tomorrow will be all right in the name of Jesus.<br><br>Not long before Sarah had Isaac, she had written herself off. The Almighty God said she would have a son and she laughed because she considered it impossible as she was ninety years old already. No matter how long you may have been waiting for that miracle, don’t write yourself off. My God is a master at reversing the irreversible; He will show up for you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>In Luke 5:1-11 the Lord Jesus Christ Himself promised Simon Peter that he would no longer catch fish, but men. Three and a half years later, at a time that it appeared Jesus needed him the most, Peter denied the Lord and then wept bitterly because he saw himself as a failure. He was supposed to be catching men for Jesus but rather, he was denying ever knowing Him (Luke 22:55-62). After Jesus died and nothing seemed to be happening, Peter decided to go back to fishing (John 21:3). May you never backslide, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>By verse 4 of John 21, Jesus had shown up for Peter. This time Jesus said Peter would not only catch men, but also feed them. The first sermon Peter preached after that brought 3,000 souls into the kingdom of God (Acts 2:41). In Acts 3:1-8, he made a lame man walk in the name of this same Jesus who he had earlier denied. By Acts 5:14-16, his shadow had started healing the sick. No matter how many times you may have denied or disappointed Jesus, as long as you are truly repentant, God can restore and use you as mightily as He did Peter; all you have to do is repent and never go back into sin.",

      "The world has become such an unsafe place that everyone needs to move around with some form of protection. Those who are rich enough often employ armed bodyguards but this can never be sufficient. Some other people choose to go to the devil for protection but this would always land them into much more trouble. I recall the story of a boy in my village who was always getting bitten by snakes. We later found out that his father had taken him to an oracle for protection against snake bites; that was the beginning of the incessant snake bites. John 10:10 says that the devil comes to steal, kill and destroy. The devil is your enemy; don’t be fooled when he says he wants to protect you. His ultimate goal is to steal from you, kill you and destroy you.<br><br>A woman once brought her four daughters to us for prayers. The youngest was 28 years old and no man had approached any of them to ask for their hand in marriage. After a little investigation, the woman confessed that, to protect her children from dying, she had consecrated them to the ifa oracle. What she did not know is that, by so doing, she had simply given the ifa oracle new wives. We prayed and God broke the link between the girls and the oracle. The four of them got married within a year. The devil is your enemy; don’t go to him for protection.<br><br>There is only one real source of protection that cannot fail and that is protection from God Himself. Being the Almighty means that He is mightier than the mightiest. Matthew 28:18 says Jesus has all power in heaven and on earth. Philippians 2:10 says that just at the mention of His name, every knee in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth should bow. That includes physical and spiritual enemies. This same God said in Hebrews 13:5 <i>“…I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”</i> When He is protecting you, you can sleep with both eyes closed; no evil can befall you, because you dwell in His secret place (Psalms 91:1).<br><br>Those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High spend quality time with Him daily. They are the ones who abide under His shadow.",

She said, “Devil, you are a liar. My God changed water to wine, He will change water to petrol”. She poured a gallon of water into the generator, laid hands on it and said, “Generator, in the mighty name of Jesus, start working”. She turned it on and it worked until the programme ended. That is faith. Is your faith still like that, or do you now rationalise everything?<br><br>To get back to your first love, you must once again go back to meditating on His word day and night. You must go back to spending more time with Him than you do with anyone else. You must choose to have Him as the first Person you speak to when you wake in the morning and the last you say goodnight to. You must choose to study your Bible and pray for long hours as you used to. Beloved, remember your first love.<br><br>One thing I need to warn you about is that God relates with us based on who we are and not who we were. He said in Ezekiel 18:21-24 that if a person has been doing good and then the fellow decides to become bad, He would forget the days of good and deal with the fellow based on his current disposition and vice versa.<br><br>Who are you to God now?

      "In our Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ made it clear that you either love God or mammon; It is not possible to love the two at the same time. Loving God one hundred percent takes care of the second commandment which says, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself’ because in 1 John 4:20, the Bible says, <i>“If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?”</i><br><br>If you love Jesus, God will love you specially in return and He will dwell with you (John 14:23). Romans 8:28 says, <i>“All things work together for good to them that love God.”</i> Irrespective of whatever may be happening; it will end up for your good, because according to Romans 8:37, you will be more than a conqueror. If you fight without God, you are bound to lose. If you fight and ask for God’s support, you’ll win but may have some battle scars. If God does the fighting for you, He will win on your behalf and hand over the victory to you. That is what makes you more than a conqueror.<br><br>John 15:14 says, <i>“Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you”<i/>. Obey God’s commandments if you truly love Him. You can also show that you love Him by giving.

      "Today, I want to share with you a secret that took many great men and women a long time and a lot of pain to learn: it is that you must be very careful who you bring close to you. Most of the people who parade themselves as friends are not genuine. For some of them, they had ulterior motives from the beginning of your friendship while for many others, the moment things get a little tough, they betray your friendship. Only a few, and I mean a tiny little number of people can be called real friends.<br><br>The information you let out to someone can never be retrieved, so you have to be careful what you tell your ‘friends’. When I joined The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I became very close to two brothers. One day, God revealed to me that one of them is not a real friend, but a wolf in sheep’s clothing. I confronted him about it and he strongly denied being a fake friend to me. A few years later, when I became General Overseer, I was going to discuss my new role with him when he opened up and told me that he had hated me from the day I came into the Church. Many of us have had similar betrayals; unfortunately, not everyone learns from their experiences.<br><br>Your real friends are those who are happy when you are happy and sad when you are sad. When the soldiers came to arrest the Lord Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane (John 18: 1-10), Peter drew a sword and tried to defend Jesus. How can one man stand against several armed soldiers? He faced them as if it were he they had come to take. That is a friend. Judas on the other hand in John 12:3-6 showed that he only cared about himself and not Jesus. When he saw a woman pouring expensive ointment on Jesus, he should have been happy to see his friend being celebrated that much, but instead, he complained and tried to stop the woman from worshipping Him. That is not a true friend. You need to watch out for these things over a long period of time with the help of the Holy Ghost, to sift out who your true friends are.",

      "Building healthy relationships and getting close to people - especially fellow believers is good. All relationships, however, must be clearly defined and never allowed to become a source or platform for sin. For example, the Pastor can know the name of a sister in the Church and the department she works in - that is an expected level of intimacy. Her friend in that department can know her house, parents, place of work, likes and dislikes - that is another level of intimacy. However, due to a higher level of intimacy between spouses, her husband is expected to know more about her than anyone else.<br><br>There is a level of intimacy that a brother should never have with a sister he is not married to and vice versa. When you notice that you are getting so close to someone that you can hardly go one hour without thinking about that fellow, you need to cut that relationship. When you notice that if a colleague who is a member of the opposite sex does not come to the office, you are not yourself that day, there is fire on the mountain that must be addressed immediately before it destroys you. <br><br>Many people have fallen into adultery and fornication because they had a seemingly harmless relationship with a ‘friend’. Any friend who knows you more than your spouse could easily become a home breaker. Any friend you feel more comfortable talking with than you do talking to your spouse is a potential enemy. No one should know you better than your spouse. If someone of the opposite sex is trying to know you more intimately than they should, be firm about letting them know their limits.<br><br>A man does not need to know where any woman he is not married to shops for her underwear - that information is not for his ears.

This happened because of just one mistake.<br><br>In 2 Samuel 11, David made a mistake which gave birth to several others.

      "The law of harvest states that you will reap much more than whatever you sow. This is why you must be careful of the kinds of seed you sow, because when harvest comes, it is always much more than the seed. In our Bible readings for today, we see Jacob sowing a seed in the first passage and then reaping the harvest in the second. In the first passage, he deceived his father in order to get the blessing and so his children also deceived him that Joseph their brother was dead. Genesis 37:35 says, <br><br><b>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</b> <br><br>Many a time, the harvest of your seeds comes when you are too old to do anything about it. Everything you do now is a seed and the harvest will come back to you when you may not have as much energy as you do now.<br><br>I thank God for some of the seeds I sowed as a young man because I am now reaping the harvests. In 1961, as a 19 year-old, I gave some money to a poor, sick old man – a neighbor, so he could get some medicine. The man said to me that someday, I would be travelling abroad as often as people go the market. I laughed at that prophecy because in my village in those days, if anyone was returning from a trip abroad, the entire village would not go to the farm that day. The hunters would come out and shoot their guns in celebration of the person and everyone would be rejoicing.

Beloved, summon up strength and keep hope alive. Habakkuk 2:3 says that every vision is for an appointed time. Your appointed time will soon come in the name of Jesus.<br><br>While waiting for their appointed time, many people do things that put a dent in their testimonies. In Genesis 16:2, Sarah asked Abraham to have an extra marital affair with her maid so that the young girl could have a child for him. Sarah gave up hope and compromised. She later regretted it when her appointed time came and she now had her own child. In Genesis 21:10, she told Abraham to send the maid away with her son. Beyond that, I’m sure when she looks down from heaven now and sees some of the seeds of that maid attacking her own seeds, she would wish she had kept hope alive.<br><br>While waiting for your appointed time, just ensure that you are obeying every instruction of God to the letter, whether it makes sense or not. Many years ago, we were offered the chance to buy all 40 acres of a serene campground called the “Youth Camp”, for N100,000. That was a lot of money back then. I gathered my people together and we prayed quoting the Scripture:<br><br><b>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.</b><br>Joshua 1:3<br><br>We put off our shoes and walked round that camp ground praying and confessing that it was ours, by faith. Not long afterwards, another ministry heard that the property was available for sale and they promptly paid for it. Our hopes were dashed, but I encouraged myself in the Lord and kept hope alive. Before long, God led us to where the Redemption Camp is situated, though then it was notorious for being a home for highway robbers and big snakes. We trusted in the Lord and purchased the first parcel of land that has grown to become Redemption City today. The Redemption City now sits on an expanse of land far greater than what we had earlier wanted to purchase. Thank God that we kept hope alive for our appointed time.",

As we see in our Bible reading today, Paul did not allow anything at all to discourage him from working for God. In another instance (Acts 13:6-12), Paul was trying to preach to a governor, but Elymas, the sorcerer, tried to convince the man not to accept the gospel. Paul did not get discouraged; he struck the sorcerer with blindness, got him out of the way and won the governor for Christ. Fire is never afraid of whatever stands in its path.<br><br>I remember when we first went to the town of Ede in Nigeria to hold a crusade. There were indications of resistance in the spirit realm, but we put our faith in God and were not discouraged. As the programme was starting, it began to rain very heavily. I wasn’t bothered; as long as it was rain and not fire falling, I decided we would continue the programme. Suddenly, as the choir was about to step on the stage, it collapsed. There was a brother there who owned a tipper. I told him to drive the tipper into the crusade ground, and it became our stage. We went ahead to hold the programme despite all the challenges we faced. <br><br>Don’t be discouraged by all those who are trying to stand in the way of the assignments God has committed into your hands; keep going. If they refuse to move out of your way, they will be consumed in Jesus’ name. Be relentless in your pursuit of Kingdom goals. Don’t let lack of funds stop you from doing what you want to do for God. Get going; God will provide the funds when you move. Don’t let disappointments and betrayals weigh you down; encourage yourself in the Lord and keep moving (1 Samuel 30:6).<br><br>Over the years, so many things have stood in my way - including man-made laws. If those who decide to obstruct meremain in my way, no problem; whatever casualties will result from that will not be my fault.

      "Fire is very generous. If you have one hundred candles to light, all you have to do is light one of them and that one candle can be used to light the remaining 99. Fire lights up other materials that have the potential to carry it. <br><br>Fire is always looking out for good materials that are flammable. In Deuteronomy 34:9, when Moses saw that Joshua was a good material, he imparted the Spirit of Wisdom into him. When Elijah saw that Elisha was a good material, he gave him a double portion of his power. Who are the good materials that you have noticed around you - people with potential to do exploits for God, if only they could be mentored correctly? Get close to them and heat them up for God. You don’t know how far that good material around you will burn for God if only you can bring him or her close enough to get some heat from you. <br><br>I don’t understand how some men of God try to quench the fire of others. Fire does not compete with itself. When fire meets fire, they join forces to impact the environment even more. Is there someone else who carries fire around you? Put denomination aside and join forces to advance the Kingdom of God. Individually there are some obstacles that your fire may be too small to overcome, but when you come together, you can bring down very high mountains. When one fire seems to be going down, the moment it comes in contact with another, the new one rekindles it and makes it burn more. It amazes me that sometimes when children of God see another child of God going cold, they would rejoice and say they are ‘minding their own business’ rather than getting closer to the person and helping to rekindle his or her fire so that the person can burn even more for God.<br><br>Fire burns better when it is in contact with other fires. You and other fires around you will burn better if you come together from time to time to rekindle one another. This is why you find pastors coming together to form associations, so that everyone can ensure that nobody’s fire goes down.

Wherever fire is, everyone around there feels it’s heat and whatever comes in contact with it would either be consumed or become fire too.

It is okay when you have just come into a school to say, “Oh, we are surrounded by sinners” but after three months, it would be a shame if they are all still sinners. How can you be in an office for three years with everybody there remaining the same? Fire compels everything around it to become like it. If you have not been preaching the gospel to the people around you, where is your heat? Why have you gone so cold? <br><br>In 1 Kings 18:36-39, when Elijah demonstrated that he is fire, the whole nation fell on their faces and said, “Your God is God”. In Acts 16:25-34, when Paul and Silas were thrown into jail, by the time they had demonstrated that they are fire, the jailer humbled himself and said, “Tell me what I must do to be saved”.

Is there any of your colleagues who is looking up to God for the fruit of the womb? See it as an opportunity to preach Christ to your entire office.

However, I refused to follow the trend of wearing it all the time. One man of God said to me then, “I like you, but I don’t like the way you dress like a hunter” – apparently referring to the conservative French suits I often wear.

      "This teaching series on 'flames of fire' is meant for everyone; however, I'll encourage youths to pay extra attention. <br><br>There are four basic elements in the world - water, earth, air and fire, each of which is very important to human existence. As important as all these elements are however, it is interesting that God chose to make His ministers flames of fire. <br><br>Let us discuss some characteristics of fire. The first thing about fire is that it is distinct. When you see fire, you recognise it immediately. In 2 Kings 1:1-8, the king was sick and sent his servants to enquire from some idol worshippers whether he would recover or not, only for them to meet a man on the way who sent them back to the king with a message that he would die. Once the messengers described the man, the king said, “That is Elijah”. Fire is uniquely distinct and you cannot mistake it for anything else. <br><br>People should be able to see a child of God and say, “This is a child of God”. These days, many people say, “Oh, it’s not about the outward appearance; God is only interested in what is on the inside”. One day while teaching at the Bible College, I brought two oranges – one green and one yellow, and asked the students to identify the ripe one. They all pointed to the yellow one, explaining that, from the way it looked, it was clear that it was the ripe one.<br><br>Fire has a distinct look; when you see it, you would know it. Don’t believe the lie that God is not interested in your outward appearance - He is. While it is true that He cannot be deceived by your outward appearance as He said in 1 Samuel 16:7, His word says that what you are on the inside will show on the outside. Matthew 23:26 says,<br><br><b>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</b> <br><br>You cannot claim, as a minister, that you are a flame of fire when you don’t look it. You cannot claim that you are a child of God, yet dress and look like people of the world. If you need to tell people that you are a child of God before they believe it, you are not yet a flame of fire.",

      "Following our discussion which started yesterday, the second question that you should ask yourself is, “What kind of example am I going to be for those coming behind me?” You see, God can raise somebody and promote him or her greatly, but when the fellow makes a mistake and crashes, he or she becomes an example for others to learn from, so as not to make the same mistake. If you read 1 Corinthians 10:1-11 carefully, you would see that verses 1-4 were dedicated to describing the investments that God had made in the people of Israel, then the rest of the passage goes on to list how many of them became bad examples for those of us coming after. God is making investments in you now, He is making sure that you read and hear certain messages, He is promoting you and doing miracles for you now; what will be the outcome of all these? Will you be used as a good example later in future or a bad one? <br><br><b>But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</b><br>1 Corinthians 10:5 <br><br>The verse above says God was not pleased with many of them. The truth is that not many people will end up as good examples; most will end up as bad ones because only a few will be violent enough to take the Kingdom of God by force (Matthew 11:12). The devil will throw a lot of temptations your way. Some of them will come as harmless suggestions, but you have to be fully ready to submit to the Lord and resist the devil so that he would flee (James 4:7).<br><br>As we see in our Bible reading of today, purge yourself of all unrighteousness so you can set the right examples for those coming behind you.

I had read passages in the Bible like Ezekiel 33:14-16 where God said if He says to the wicked that he will die, but the wicked changes his ways, then He wouldn’t let him die anymore. However, what is mind-boggling about Saul’s case is that this is a different kind of repentance. Of a truth, Saul was a very humble, diligent and responsible young man before he became king. In 1 Samuel 9:3-4, his father sent him on an errand to search for some missing animals. Saul kept searching and was determined not to return home until he found them.

They had prayed and, although God had stopped the angel that was spreading the plague, He did not recall him; the angel remained at the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.

God knows, I never wanted to be a Pastor, talk less of a General Overseer, but I am a living sacrifice. I had wanted to retire at the age of seventy, so that I could then begin to live a normal life – sleep when others sleep, eat when others eat and so on, but God said, “No”.

However, since I am a living sacrifice, I asked God, “What do I do with this money?” He responded that I should divide it into three parts and give each to a different ministry while retaining nothing for myself. As painful as this was, I was comforted when He said further, “I will be your source”. When you become a living sacrifice, God will become your source. The day you became a living sacrifice, you became His property, so He will take care of you.

An altar is a meeting place between God and man. In our Bible reading for today, we see how, even when Jacob was unaware that he was at an altar, he saw in a dream that the place was a meeting point between heaven and earth. For example, an altar can be a corner of your room if you are living in a one-room apartment. You could set aside a corner in your room with a commitment to meet with God there regularly. You must treat the place as holy; because that is the altar of the Almighty God. The moment you set aside that place as an altar to God, any time you go there, God would be waiting.<br><br>When man goes to an altar, he does so to offer sacrifices to God and to worship Him. In Genesis 22:1-14 when God asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a burnt offering, He asked him to go to a particular place, raise an altar there and present a sacrifice. When visiting a great man, because of how much you honour him, you don’t go empty-handed, so why do so when going to meet with the Most High God? Don’t go to God empty handed. If you don’t have anything at all, He will accept a sacrifice of praise (Jeremiah 17:26).<br><br>When God comes to meet man on the altar, He comes to bless. Psalms 67:5-7 tells us that when praises go up, blessings come down. In Genesis 22:15-18, when Abraham brought Isaac to the altar to be offered, God stopped him and said, “You have done your part, let me do mine, in blessing I will bless you, in multiplying, I will multiply your seed”. God meets with His children during services to bless them, especially those who come with a sacrifice. I raised an altar in a small room inside the first house I lived in the Redemption Camp well over 20 years ago. The house is now called the ‘Open Heavens International Centre’. Since that place was marked out as an altar, up to today, people who go there to pray in faith receive mighty miracles from God that even I find amazing.",

As for me, I am fully aware that without God, I am nothing, absolutely nothing and I tell Him that regularly.<br><br>I preached a sermon at the commissioning into ministry of one of my sons about 40 years ago. I told them about the ass that Jesus rode in our Bible reading for today. The ass must have suddenly looked around and seen people laying down their clothes on the ground for him to walk on, with a lot of singing and dancing going on as he passed by. He must have really felt special. However, the moment Jesus got down and left him, he was abandoned. By then he must have been far from home and probably did not even know his way back. He must have passed by humans and instead of rejoicing like before, they most likely chased it away. At best, he would have ended up as a labourer on a farm. Beloved, the moment God leaves you, you are finished. You think you’re smart? Just a little tweak of a professor’s brain and he can become a mad man roaming the streets. <br><br>When people see me living holy, being humble, obeying God to the letter, it is because I don’t want Him to leave me. I don’t want to look around and discover that He is no longer with me. I don’t want to pray and have Him ignore my prayers. I am imploring you my beloved, don’t do anything that would make God leave you.<br><br>At some point on the cross, Jesus cried, “Father, why hast thou forsaken me” (Matthew 27:46). Think about it: when the whole world turned against Him, He did not mind, but when the Father turned from Him, He cried. Even if the whole world turns against you, you are fine as long as God is still on your side. Without God, you are nothing.",

There are people who pray, study the Bible and are even more talented than you, but God chose you; you should be grateful for that. In any case, if we were to count iniquity, who will stand? (Psalms 130:3). When people see the things God is doing in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, they think I must be special. The only thing special about me is that God chose me, because even from as far back as when I was a little child, God had promised my Father-in-the Lord that The Redeemed Christian Church of God would go round the world. It had nothing to do with me at all; God just decided to glorify Himself through this Church and it is only by grace that He chose me to be the General Overseer. He could have chosen anyone else. There are people far more qualified than I, but it is by grace that I was chosen.<br><br>When you see people still drowning in sin, don’t judge them because you are on your way to heaven; rather, pray that God will save them by His grace.

The people of Israel may have thought that God parted the Red Sea and drowned Pharaoh and his army because they were so special. He did it for His name’s sake.

      "More often than not, the people who provoke God do so through pride. The most junior staff in an organisation would typically be humble and submissive. However, the day the person begins to feel overly important, he or she will start provoking some people. The moment you become proud, you begin to provoke God. Never forget that no matter how high you go, God is still the Most High. <br><br>God usually deals with proud people in two ways. The first way is by recalling such a person suddenly and in a disgraceful manner. In Acts 12:20-24, king Herod’s pride made him consent to being compared to the Most High. This made God order worms to eat him up alive. The Lord said, “Oh, you think you are big because you are the Commander-in-Chief of some armies? I have armies that don’t carry guns - ordinary worms”. One moment Herod was sitting on the throne, the next moment, he was being eaten by worms. However, the Lord could also decide to disgrace the fellow openly while preserving his or her life. That is what He did to Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4:28-37. <br><br>Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest king of his time. He built a city called Babylon, which had one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. At a point, God saw that he was becoming proud and sent him a warning through a dream. Unfortunately, one year after the message came, he had forgotten it, so God said, “Okay, you think you are big? Go and eat with animals for seven years”. Nobody removed his royal robes from him; he removed them with his own hands. If there is something that must leave your life permanently today, it is pride.<br><br>Be careful as you rise, so as not to begin to feel like you are overly important. The elders say that when the cockroach falls, nobody hears the sound; when an ant falls, the ground doesn’t tremble, but if an elephant falls, the tremors would be felt both near and far. If God is elevating you, be weary of pride so that it doesn’t become a case of Him raising up an elephant so that when it falls everyone would pay attention, like in the case of Pharaoh (Romans 9:17).",

We can infer a theorem from this – that when God loves you, He will give you His life. In mathematics, whenever we establish a theorem, there always has to be the corollary – something that follows as a result of what we just established. The corollary to our newly established theorem is in Proverbs 8:36:<br><br><b>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</b><br><br>Herod was a man who hated God; he did everything he could to hinder the work of the Lord and he died a shameful death. After his death, the Bible says, <i>“But the word of God grew and multiplied”</i> (Acts 12:24). Anyone who tries to stand in the way of the Most High God hates Him and is calling for death. <br><br>Some time ago, in another country, we wanted to dedicate a new parish, but in the process of trying to get the necessary approvals, a government official swore to prevent it. My children called me to report the incident and, believe me honestly, I didn’t even bother to pray about it. On the day of the meeting at which this government official was planning to have our application rejected, he put both feet into one trouser leg. While struggling with the trouser, he fell, hurt himself and was rushed to the hospital. He died with both legs still in one side of the trouser. <br><br>You may claim not to oppose the work of God as directly as that.

He was Abraham’s nephew and must have been trained according to the instructions of God, but when the angels got to Sodom and Gomorrah, who did they find at the gate of the city? Lot.

Sow seeds of service to God now because a time is coming when you will be so old, you will not have the strength to run around doing God’s work. Even if you don’t face any storm at all in your lifetime, a time is coming when you will face the storm of death. At that time, God will ask you, what did you use the talents I gave you for?<br><br>Sow good seeds now because when a storm comes, you would need them to speak for you. When you read the story of the sinful woman in Luke 7:37-38, you would see that she sowed a seed that day by washing Jesus’ feet with her tears and wiping them with her hair. She also poured a very costly ointment on Him and Jesus took note of her. May you do something today that will cause God to take note of you. <br><br>During a meeting with my covenant partners some years ago, I told them to ask God for just one thing. There was a woman amongst them who had been barren for many years and what she asked God for was a baby. She got pregnant and went to the U.S. for tests, but the doctors said that there were high chances of the baby being HIV positive and would have to be evacuated. She refused and cried to the Lord, asking for a sign that would convince her that He had heard her prayer. He responded, “Go home; before you get there, you will get a sign”. It was during her return to Nigeria that we ran into each other on the plane. She started screaming and when I asked her what the issue was, she explained to me. I prayed with her and a few months later, she delivered the baby safe and sound. The baby was HIV negative and even her husband who had been HIV positive also became negative. Her seed spoke for her. <br><br>May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble and remember all your offerings in Jesus’ name. ",

If you want to make friends with people, show yourself friendly to them first (Proverbs 18:24). If you want them to favour you, favour them first. I have seen people arrive at my house frowning but depart with beaming smiles after experiencing my wife's hospitality. Indeed, some people don’t have friends because they don’t show themselves friendly.<br><br>Several years ago, one of my daughters came to me and said, “Daddy, I’m this old, and nobody has approached me to say, ‘Thus saith the Lord…’”. I said, “With the way you glare at everybody as if you are spoiling for a fight, who is going to approach you and say, ‘Thus saith the Lord” even if God is actually speaking? You never smile; you are always looking as if somebody offended you, and so, if a brother should even be coming your way, one look at your face is enough to make him change his mind.” Thank God she took the feedback graciously and made the necessary changes. It wasn’t long after that she got married. Love should be reciprocal. <br><br>Whether you believe it or not, everyone needs good friends. Our Bible reading for today says for the one who has no friend, WHEN he falls, there would be no one to lift him. Take note that the word ‘when’ was used, not ‘if’. Everyone will have times when they need someone to lift them; God forbid that there is no one to lift you when that time comes. Proverbs 18:24 says that there are some friends that stick closer than a brother. You need friends, so show yourself friendly to those around you.<br><br>You must, however, choose your friends carefully because, as iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17), so does evil communication (bad company) corrupt good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33).

That is the kind of joy that overwhelms you so much that even when you want to express it verbally, you would find yourself speechless. Some years ago, we had a programme in a town called Ota in Ogun State, Nigeria. A lady who had been barren for several years came there that day asking for prayers, after her husband’s relatives had threatened to throw her out within the year. There were many people so I didn’t even know who I prayed for. The following year, we were holding another programme somewhere else, with a long queue of those who wanted me to pray for them. Unknown to me, this same lady was there and when it got to her turn, she kept opening her mouth to speak but said nothing. Finally, she was able to utter just one word: “Jesus”. When she finally was able to speak, she explained that she was that barren woman I had prayed for the previous year. It was then I realized why she had been speechless earlier; she was carrying a baby on her left and another on her right - she had given birth to twins. I pray you will soon experience joy unspeakable, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Our memory verse (1 Peter 1:8) says if you believe in God, then He will make available to you joy unspeakable, full of glory.

James 2:17 says: <br><br><b>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</b><br><br>Your behaviour must show that you believe in God.

      "God is love and perfect love can only be experienced in Him (1 John 4:16-17). No matter how strong human love is, it usually has a hidden agenda and will remain imperfect if it is not established in God. <br><br>There is a classic example of two people who loved each other in the Bible: David and Jonathan. In 1 Samuel 18:4, the Bible says:<br><br><b>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</b> <br><br>Looking closely at the gifts, you would observe that Jonathan gave David practically everything except his shoes. This is because in Bible times, one way to seal a contract is the giving of shoes, without which everything given can be reclaimed (Ruth 4:7). In those days also, only sons wore shoes; servants were not allowed to. That is why in Luke 15:11-24, when the prodigal son returned, the father asked that shoes be put on his feet to show that he had accepted him back as a son and not a servant. Thus, we see that Jonathan was saying to David, in essence, “We are friends, but don’t forget who you are. You are a beloved servant, but I am the son. You are only a beloved servant”. In 1 Samuel 20:13-16 and verse 42, we see that Jonathan entered a covenant with David when it became clear that the latter would be king, extracting a promise from him not to wipe out his family. Later on, he even asked to become David’s assistant (1 Samuel 23:17). Be careful when people say they love you; it may be because of what they can get from you. If it so happens that there is nothing to get anymore, then you would know who truly loves you. <br><br>God’s love for us, however, is perfect and unconditional. He loved us even while we were yet sinners (Romans 5:8). He sacrificed His only begotten son so you and I can be saved (John 3:16). He alone is worthy of all your trust (1 John 4:16). Choose the perfect love of God today by surrendering your life to Jesus. It is only in Him that we have an assurance of boldness on the day of judgement (1 John 4:17) and eternal life (Romans 6:23).",

There are many great treasures of knowledge in the Bible that will benefit anyone willing to search them out. <br><br>When you study the Bible, you should be on the lookout for new things you can learn and apply in your marriage, business, career, ministry or any other aspect of life. Proverbs 18:15 says:<br><br><b>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</b><br><br>The Bible is not a story book; it is a life manual, and lessons from it must be applied in our lives. Romans 15:4 says <i>“For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.”</i><br><br>2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us that the Scripture is given to us so that we can be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto ALL, not some, but ALL good works:<br><br><b>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</b><br><br>Living according to the standards of God as shown in the Bible may appear difficult, it is however, better that you discipline yourself to do so because the results would be great in your life.

His word says you should be diligent, so be diligent and as a result, you will stand before kings (Proverbs 22:29).

When God breathes against your enemies, not only will they be no more, you will also be established in the place of your destiny. David testified to this in verse 20 of today’s Bible reading:<br><br><b>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</b><br><br>With one breath, the Lord cleared off all David’s enemies and also brought him into a large place. Do you know that God can do the same for you today? He can clear off all your enemies and take you to that same place that they have been trying to stop you from getting to.<br><br>Now, I have always said that the summary of all Jesus’ messages in the Bible is that nothing goes for nothing. In other words, there are always conditions to be met for everything that we expect God to do for us. What is the condition for God to breathe against our enemies and to lead us to the glorious end He has set ahead of us? It is in verses 21-25 of our Bible reading – holiness. David said the Lord rewarded him according to his righteousness and the cleanliness of his hands. <br><br>Are your hands clean? When a person is faced with enemy forces he or she cannot defeat; an ally stronger than the enemy forces would be required to guarantee victory. The ally would however, withdraw their support if the person offends them. Don’t offend your Ally. Don’t do things that will make the Lord refuse to fight for you. ",

      "The first thing you need to know about our topic for today is that God does not breathe to survive like we humans do. Someone who cannot die definitely does not need to breathe to stay alive. Thus, when we say that God breathes, it means that something rare and special is about to happen. Genesis 2:7 says:<br><br><b>And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</b><br><br>The Almighty God, who does not need to breathe to remain alive, decided to breathe because He wanted to give life to a non-living thing. He breathed on ordinary clay, and it became a living soul. When He breathes on the dead, they come to life. That is how powerful the breath of God is, and believe me honestly, as humans, one thing or the other will seem to be dead in our lives at one point or the other, so we all need God to breathe on us.<br><br>Romans 4:19 says not only was Sarah’s womb dead, her husband’s body was dead too, but the One who can breathe life into the dead brought it back to life. He does not only breathe on dead wombs; He can also breathe on dead businesses, careers, marriages, ministries and many more. <br><br>You may have noticed an area of your life where there has been no progress for years; you would need God to breathe on it and bring it to life. Genesis 49:22 says <i>“Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall”</i>. Joseph prospered everywhere he went – even as a slave (Genesis 39:2), a prisoner (Genesis 39:21-23) and then as a prime minister (Genesis 41:41). <br><br>The first verse of today’s Bible reading shows the secret of Joseph’s fruitfulness – he feared the Lord and walked in His ways. You have to stop committing sin and walk in the ways of the Lord, then you would find out that what had seemed dead before would begin to bear fruit. I pray that God will give you the grace to fear Him and to always do His will, in Jesus’ name.",

      "After you have received your vision for the year from God, the next step is to write it (Habakkuk 2:2). Many times, the reason we don’t achieve what we set out to, is simply that we never wrote it down. God’s recommendation for running with a vision is to, first and foremost, write it down. Have you received an idea or instruction from the Lord? Go ahead and write it down now. In the course of doing this, you are bringing it to life; you are taking it from the spirit realm to the physical. Writing it is your first step towards achieving it. You are to write it down along with what you will do to achieve it. <br><br>The next step will be to <i>“make it plain upon tables”</i>. In making it plain, you can break it into objectives or smaller goals, and as you accomplish each of them, you’ll get closer to achieving the entire vision. Note that Habakkuk 2:2 says ‘tables’ and not ‘table’. You are therefore to paste it everywhere around you where you will keep seeing it over and over again. When you do that, you and those the Lord has prepared to support you can begin to run with it.<br><br>Now, beyond writing down what to do to achieve the vision, you must also take note of the things not to do to ensure that your vision is fulfilled. Matthew 9:17 says:<br><br><b>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</b><br><br>You cannot achieve new things with old habits. There are some friends who pulled you back last year; you need to dissociate yourself from them this year. Check your morning routines last year; did they help you get the best out of your days? If not, then you need to change them. How was your relationship with God last year? If it was shaky, then you must be determined to draw closer to Him this year than ever before. Remember, if the Lord does not build a house, those who try to build it are merely wasting their time (Psalms 127:1).",

      "Every New Year typically comes with renewed hope, encouraging many people to set new goals. Yes, it is important to set goals; however, it is more important to ensure that they align with God's will for your life. <br><br>Let us consider God’s recommendation for setting goals as captured in Habakkuk 2:1, which says:<br><br><b>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me…</b><br><br>Have you asked the Lord about His plans for you this year? Have you waited on Him to know what exactly He will have you pursue this year? If you haven’t, please spend some time seeking His face for divine direction. <br><br>Speed is not always synonymous with progress. If you are speeding away in the wrong direction, you will discover that you have gone backwards rather than forward at the end of the day. Only God, who created you for His purpose knows the direction you should be going per time, so always ask him for guidance. Remember, a way that seems right may have death at its end (Proverbs 14:12). <br><br>There was a time when we were organising crusades across various cities in Nigeria. When we were scheduled to move to the southern part of the country, I asked God for His will and He told us to go to Ede instead, a town in the western part of the country. I responded that we had just been to Ife (a town just a few kilometres away from Ede) but I still went ahead to obey Him. <br><br>At the crusade, the king of Ede, a Muslim, promised to gift us whatever size of land we desired. As we were about to mention a size we considered huge enough, the Lord directed us to ask for a whole lot more. Humanly speaking, it didn't make sense to make such a request, but we obeyed God, and the king granted our request. Today, the Redeemer's University and the School of Missions are situated on that land.<br><br>Let God be the One to show you the goals to pursue this year. If it is His vision, you are assured of His provision and support until you achieve it.",
