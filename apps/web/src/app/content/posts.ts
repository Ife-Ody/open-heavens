      "<p>The silver-haired head is a crown of glory, If it is found in the way of righteousness. Proverbs 16:31 (NKJV) One of the blessings that God has bestowed on His children is long life. This is evident in our memory verse for today. The Bible says that you will be satisfied with long life; therefore, no matter what happens in the world, you cannot die young. No matter the number of diseases and infections in the world, you will not die young. You will live old and wax strong in the Lord. Again, the memory verse shows that the Lord promised long life to those who have been saved. In other words, He wishes those who are His children long life. I prophesy to you, you will live long, in Jesus’ name. Also, today’s Bible reading says that for you to live long, you must honour your parents and elders. honouring your parents is the only commandment that comes with a promise. If you do not respect your elders, you will not become an elder. Therefore, it is not debatable. You must obey your parents if you want to live long. Never insult, disrespect, or provoke them to anger. They are your gods on earth, and just as you would not provoke God, you must not provoke them. If you do so and they curse you out of anger, it will surely come to pass, except God shows you mercy. The ball is in your court, and I believe you will do the right thing.</p>",

      "One of my sons while preaching some time ago said Jacob laboured for 14 years to get the woman he wanted to marry (Genesis 29:18-30) while Isaac simply took a stroll and came back with a wife (Genesis 24:63-67). One had favour, the other exerted labour. The moment he said that, I made up my mind that I am going to enjoy God's favour in every area of my life. This decision led me to make what you will probably call 'New Year resolutions'. These resolutions are deliberate steps I will take towards basking in divine favour for the rest of my life. I am going to share these steps with you over the next six days and I want to encourage you to take them very seriously. Please do not treat them like the typical New Year resolutions that are often quickly forgotten in the course of the year.<br>This year, like never before, I am determined to praise and worship God with all my heart and strength. Whenever you eulogise someone from the bottom of your heart, you can get that fellow to volunteer to help you. I will worship and praise God so much that He will volunteer to help me like He did for Paul and Silas in Acts 16: 25-26.<br>My biological father was so poor that whenever the time came for school fees to be paid, he will pick quarrels with his two wives so that they wouldn't be able to ask for the children's school fees. However, my mother knew how to get my school fees. She would go into my father's room and eulogize him to the extent that he would ask her,“What can I do for you today?” My mother would promptly ask for my school fees and he would immediately promise to see to it that my school fees are paid.<br>This year, I am going to praise and worship God more than ever before. Like David who also enjoyed divine favour all through his life, I will bless God at all times and His praise shall continually be in my mouth (Psalm 34:1). I will never stop praising His holy name. I will be intentional in praising Him at all times. I will praise Him with everything within me (Psalm 103:1). I will speak of His greatness at all times and He will cover me specially with His favour all through this year and beyond. I will praise my God forever (Psalm 145:1-2). What about you?",

      "I started sharing what you may call my 'New Year resolutions' yesterday and I will be discussing the second resolution on my list today. This year, I will open my mouth and tell God exactly how things are with me. I have discovered from experience that many people have become so good at pretending that all is well when all is not, even before God, the One who knows everything.<br>In our Bible reading today, the men of Jericho revealed the true state of their city to Elisha and God used the prophet to put an end to the problem in their land. Come to think of it however, Elijah, the spiritual father of Elisha, walked among the people of Jericho for years, but it was not recorded in the Bible that they informed him of the problems they were facing. They suffered for so long because of their silence! This year, I have decided that I am not going to suffer in silence. I am going to tell the Almighty God what my problems are; I am going to tell Him everything because I know that He will solve them all. I will not wait until I am about to lose things that are precious to me before I cry out like the widow in 2 Kings 4:1-7 did.<br>I visited one of my uncles many years ago and his wife served me pounded yam about the size of a baby's fist. If I had intended to stay for one day, I would have kept my mouth shut, but I was going to stay for one week and pounded yam of that size will not satisfy me at all. I was very young, and I had a healthy appetite. So, I called the woman, “Excuse me ma'am, am I welcome here?” She said, “Yes, of course you are.” I said, “In that case, this pounded yam cannot satisfy me; please let me have some more.” She went into her bedroom, and I did not know what she told her husband, but I heard them laughing. I couldn't have cared less; as long as she came back with more pounded yam, I was fine.<br>This year, ensure that you do not pretend or form as the youths will say, before God. Tell Him exactly where the shoe hurts. Make up your mind like me to ask for His help more than ever before and He will surely answer you (Matthew 21:22).",

      "This year, I have decided that I will humble myself more than ever before. I will ask anyone who can assist me for help, irrespective of their status. Many people do not have a problem with asking for help from someone who is 'superior' to them, but a lot find it difficult to seek for help from people they consider to be beneath them. This sort of attitude robs many people of their blessings.<br>When I was in secondary school, I was good at Mathematics and other subjects, but I knew that I needed extra coaching to pass the English Language. In those days, it didn't matter how brilliant you were; if you passed all other subjects and failed the English Language, you'd be considered a failure. I asked a junior of mine who was born in England and had a very good command of English Language to teach me, and I got an A! He can boast today that he taught me, but it wouldn't matter because I already have my certificate. This year, don't let pride hold you back from the help you can get to fulfil your destiny.<br>Unfortunately, however, many proud people don't know that they are proud. Some of them even boast about their pride and give it fancy names like self-esteem, self-confidence and so on. Beloved, any level of self-esteem that makes people afraid to approach you is pride. Someone may know the solution to your problem, but because of how you carry yourself as if you own the world, he or she may not approach you with the solution. You need to humble yourself, smile more, speak warmly to people, and make it easy for them to speak to you.<br>In our Bible reading for today, we can learn a lot from Naaman and his wife. First, his wife was approachable, and the maid was able to talk to her about her husband's embarrassing problem. Also, when Naaman got to Elisha's place and got angry that Elisha did not come out to pray for him, it was one of his servants who advised him, and he heeded the advice. The cure toNaaman's leprosy was tied to people that were considered inferior to him; thank God he was humble enough to listen to them.<br>This year, make it your resolution to humble yourself more than ever before. Remember, God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6).",

      "As a young farmer's boy, I noticed that my father sets aside the best crops for planting because the quality and quantity of the seed planted is a major determinant of the quality and quantity of the harvest. The word of God is clear about this. If you sow sparingly, you will reap sparingly, and if you sow bountifully, you will reap bountifully (2 Corinthians 9:6).<br>This year, like never before, I am going to give because I know that when I give, there will be a harvest. I will give cheerfully because God loves a cheerful giver (2 Corinthians 9:7), and I need His favour. If you are expecting a big harvest this year, make up your mind to sow bountifully.<br>I remember a time when we were preparing for our annual convention, and I needed N17,000 to install roofing sheets on the first auditorium we erected inRedemption City. I had only N1,000 and was praying to God for the remaining N16,000 when one of my pastors came into my office to ask for N1,000. He needed the money to roof the shed he was building to accommodate members under his jurisdiction during the convention. I told him I also needed money and sent him out of my office. As he was leaving, God spoke to me and said, “Call him back and give him that N1,000.” I grumbled because it was difficult, but I obeyed all the same. After the pastor had left joyfully with my N1,000 in his pocket, God said, “Son, why are you grumbling? There were two problems; I used you to solve one. The one you cannot solve, leave it to me.” Some hours later, someone came all the way from Port Harcourt and said, “Sir, I have just collected rent from my tenants, and the Almighty God said I should bring it to you.” He gave me an envelope, and I blessed him. When I opened the envelope, it contained N17,000!<br>This year, I will increase my giving towards the work of God and win souls into His kingdom more than ever before. It is written that as long as this world continues to exist, seed-time and harvest shall never cease (Genesis 8:22). Why don't you make up your mind like me to also sow towards the work of God more than ever before this year?<br>God never fails on His promises. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully (2 Corinthians 9:6).",

      "My fifth resolution is that this year, I am going to be very deliberate about putting all my trust in God, and none in man. I will do so because God said, “Vain is the help of man” (Psalm 60:11). You may have discovered that several of the people you thought will help you have let you down, but there is a God who never fails, and He will not fail you this year.<br>I went to my village in the 1980s after I had just become the General Overseer of the RCCG, and someone said to me, “Now that you are the General Overseer, you will need a befitting house to host dignitaries that may have cause to visit you here, especially when you have one ceremony or the other”. I agreed with him, and he said he would help me to build the house. He told me that he produces blocks, so he will supply me with all the blocks I'll need to build the house, and I can pay him for them whenever I can afford to. I believed God was behind it all, and I was very happy.<br>Beloved, when somebody offers you help, check first with God to be sure it's from Him. I built the house, and the very day I roofed it, he asked me to pay for all the blocks he had supplied. I was shocked. This man had said that I could pay anytime I had the money. I had just roofed the house and hadn't even put doors or windows! Deep within me, I was sorrowful. I said toGod, “Lord, you know I have never done anything that I cannot handle; it was this man who lured me into this. Please have mercy on me, don't let me be put to shame.” I prayed all night and fell asleep at my desk. When I woke up, there was a man standing at my doorstep. He said he came all the way from the north, and that God told him to give me an envelope. I collected the envelope, prayed for him, and he left. After he left, I opened the envelope; it was the exact amount that I was owing!<br>There is a God who is the ever-present help in times of trouble.

      "My sixth resolution is to walk more closely with God than ever before this year. The Bible says in James 4:8 that if you draw near to God, He will draw near to you. Our God is not a touch-and-go God; He is a God who wants you to abide in Him (John 15:4-7).<br>Some of us are Sunday-Sunday Christians; we go to church only on Sundays, and it is only then that we read our Bibles and pray. The Almighty God wants you to be close to Him, to draw nearer to Him each day. This year, like never before, I am going to draw close to God and ensure He is by my side daily. I have discovered from experience that there are problems you can solve with your efforts in a year, two years or even ten years, but if you draw near to God, He can solve them in minutes!<br>I studied for my PhD at the University of Lagos. To get a PhD in Mathematics, you must solve a problem nobody has solved before. Being a problem nobody has solved before, nobody knows whether it has a solution, and they don't give you a PhD for trying but for solving the problem. So, I began to work out the details of the problem I chose, and eventually, I ended up with 186 simultaneous equations! I had been working on the problem for 18 months and didn't know what to do next. One night, after struggling with the equations till around 10pm, I decided to go and sleep. I, however, decided to study the Bible before going to bed, and I studied Exodus 14:21-28 – the crossing of the Red Sea, and God suddenly spoke to me. He said, “Son, go and bring your mathematics problems.” He began to guide me step by step to put the equations into two different groups – one on the right and the other on the left. Suddenly, I saw something I had not seen before. All the equations on the right had something in common, and all the ones on the left had another thing in common. Then the Lord spoke to me, “Solve the ones on the left together, the ones on the right together, and then bring the two together.” In five hours, I finished the problem I had been tackling for18 months!<br>Whatever problem you might be facing, draw near to God this year, and He will give you a solution, in Jesus' name.",

I have said that in my walk with God this year, I will worship Him, ask for His help, humble myself, give to Him, trust Him and draw close to Him more than ever before. However, all these would be impossible to achieve if I do not make up my mind to live holy more than ever before. This year, I am determined never to do anything that will offend God. I will live holy more than ever before!<br>Amos 3:3 says: <strong><em>“Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” </em></strong>Please check how you have been living in the past years, do you think God will be happy to come close to you knowing fully well that His eyes cannot behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13)?<br>If you really want to get close to God, and you want Him to solve all your problems this year, then you must repent of all your sins and forsake them. Don't continue to live in sin and expect God's help. Shall we continue in sin and expect God's grace to abound? Apostle Paul's response to that question was, “God forbid!” (Romans 6:1-2). Grace is God's help, and it cannot abound upon a sinner.<br>All your seeds, worship, prayers, and so on that you have decided to do this year will be wasted if you do not live a holy life. In other words, if you do not want all your efforts to live by these resolutions this year to be fruitless, you must live holy. God does not hear the prayer of sinners (Psalm 66:18), neither does He accept their sacrifices (Isaiah 59:1-2).<br>Beloved, for all the resolutions we studied over the past six days to produce the desired result, you must be deliberate about living holy more than ever before this year and beyond. This year, I will not only love righteousness more, but will also hate iniquity more. That way, God will anoint me even much more than ever before (Hebrews 1:9).<br>The Almighty God will grant you all-round success as you make up your mind to live holy and also adopt all the other resolutions we discussed over the past six days, in Jesus' name.",

      "The old year has just passed with all its ups and downs. There is a tendency to think that things will remain the same or even become worse based on man's projections and forecasts. However, according to our Bible reading today, I speak into your life and declare that, “It shall be well with you!”<br>As assuring as this prophetic message from the Lord is, we must not lose sight of the truth embedded in our Bible reading: it is the righteous that will be singled out for wellness. Our memory verse for today affirms this as well.Beloved, I encourage you to live righteously in this new year if you want it to be well with you, your family, your business, your finances, and everything that concerns you. <br>One question you might, however, be asking yourself is, “How can one be righteous in this perverse generation when the Bible says in Romans 3:23 that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God?” The answer to this question is very simple; the Bible tells us in 1 John 1:9 that if we confess our sins, God will forgive us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, will cleanse us from all sin. Isaiah 64:6 also says:<br><strong><em>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</em></strong><br>The above scriptures establish the truth that we cannot cleanse ourselves and become acceptable to God by our own efforts; only the righteousness of God, which is obtainable through Jesus Christ, who died for our sins, is acceptable to God (Philippians 3:3-9).<br>Truly, many forecasts have projected that the year may be challenging, but I assure you that those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under His shadow (Psalm 91:1), and they will be shielded from any evil that may be lurking ahead. The Bible, however, clearly says that God cannot behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). This implies that you must have the righteousness of God through Christ if you want to access the secret place of the Most High.<br>As you surrender your life to Jesus and walk in His righteousness all through this year and beyond, I decree once again that all shall be well with you.",

      "Yesterday, I declared that it shall be well with the children of God this year, and so shall it be in the mighty name of Jesus. There are, however, certain things you must do intentionally in order to have a manifestation of this blessing in your life. One of them is to praise God at all times.<br>Our Bible reading today says that the earth will yield its increase unto you when you praise God. When you learn to praise Him with all of your heart and strength, everything on the earth will work together to ensure you have all-round success. The story in 2 Chronicles 20:20-24 is a pointer to the efficacy of praise when directed to the only One that deserves it – The Almighty God. When you praise the Almighty God, He will rise to fight your battles for you. Your enemies will be defeated, and people will rejoice with you.<br>The psalmist in our text today seemed to pray that God should grant the people the grace to praise Him. This is because only God enables people to do anything for Him (Philippians 2:13). Everything we do for God is byHis grace – even when we praise Him. Also, God encourages people to praise Him by doing seemingly impossible things for them. I pray that the Almighty God will do something spectacular in your life this year that will cause you to sing and dance for joy. Your dancing will be constant this year, in Jesus' name.<br>Years ago, the Lord told us in a service that we should praise Him and not ask for anything at all. There was a woman who came with a serious health condition. As a result of this, she was not satisfied with the way the service was going that day, so she approached the then Deputy General Overseer of blessed memory, Pa J. H. Abiona, for prayers. Papa told her that the General Overseer said that we should only praise God and not ask for anything. The woman reluctantly joined everyone else to praise the Lord. As she started praising God, she received her healing.<br>I enjoin you to cultivate the habit of praising God in an unusual way this year, and it shall truly be well with you, in Jesus' name.",

      "Over the past two days, I discussed the need for you to live righteously and make a habit of praising God if you want it to be well with you this new year. Today, I will look at prayer as one more spiritual activity that you must take very seriously in this new year so that it can be well with you.<br>It is obvious that things are getting tougher as we approach the end time. The consolation, however, is the Lord's assurance in Joel 2:32, where He says, <strong><em>“And it shall come pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered…”</em></strong><br>In the book of Judges, the Bible says that the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and consequently, the Midianites terrorised them for seven years (Judges 6:1-2). However, when the children of Israel came to the realisation that it was the Lord that was punishing them because of their sins, they cried to Him in prayers. The Lord answered and delivered them from their troubles just as He will answer you today, in Jesus' name.<br><strong><em>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</em></strong> <strong>2 Chronicles 7:14</strong><br>Beloved, for it to be well with you in this new year, you must repair your altar of prayer and be ready to pray earnestly to the Lord. Jesus promised all His followers who believe in Him that if they should ask anything in His name, He will do it (John 14:14).<br>What then are you waiting for? Pray to God now and continue to pray to Him until He causes a complete turnaround in every negative situation you might be experiencing. The Lord is ready to answer the prayers of His children this year if only they can pray. It shall be well with you as you spend quality time praying to God this year, in Jesus' name.",

      "Over the past three days, I discussed some things you must do this year for it to be well with you, and they are: living righteously, praising God, and praying fervently. Today, I will look at fasting as another thing that you should do so as to enjoy all-round wellness.<br>Our Bible reading for today is an account of the failure of the disciples of Jesus Christ to cast out the demon that was responsible for a young man's madness. However, when Jesus intervened, the young man was instantly healed. Surprisingly, some Bible translations have tried to downplay the importance of fasting and praying in the life of a Christian by deliberately omitting verse 21 from the 17th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The word of God is settled forever in heaven (Psalm 119:89). Our Lord Himself did not only pray; he also fasted a great deal (Luke 4:1-2).<br>Beloved, as you pass through this new year, add fasting to righteous living, prayers and praises to the Almighty God. You will experience His abundant goodness, and it shall be well with you. Experience has convinced me that fasting does not kill; it can only make you physically and, more importantly, spiritually stronger. My life is a testimony; I will be 82 years old in a couple of months by the grace of God, and I still fast regularly! I am stronger than many young people who eat three square meals with snacks in-between!<br>As a young Christian, I did not start with marathon fasting, so if you are not used to the spiritual exercise of fasting, you can start by skipping your breakfast and praying instead. You can then move to skipping both breakfast and lunch. Before long, you will graduate to fasting for 24 hours, and then you will graduate to engaging in marathon fasts for days like Jesus Christ, who fasted for forty days and forty nights.<br>Lastly, I should mention that when you are fasting, you are bound to be hungry. You will need a lot of self-discipline to ensure that you do not break your fasts prematurely. May God grant you the grace to fast and pray, and it shall indeed be well with you all through this year and beyond, in Jesus' name.",

      "Today, I will continue to discuss God's prophetic message to His children through His word in Isaiah 3:10 that says, “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.” It is God's will that it should be well with you in all areas of your life, and this includes your finances. Unfortunately, many people still live in poverty because they have not surrendered all to God, Who is the only source of true prosperity that has no sorrow in it (Proverbs 10:22).<br>The Bible makes us understand that man became poor as a result of sin:<br><strong><em>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,</em></strong><strong><em>saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread...</em></strong><strong>Genesis 3:17-19</strong><br>Thankfully, Jesus Christ came to redeem mankind from sin  and all its consequences, including poverty. The Bible says that Jesus became poor so that we may, through His poverty, become rich (2 Corinthians 8:9). When a person surrenders his or her life to Jesus Christ, He will redeem that fellow from poverty and make him or her a partaker of the immeasurable riches of the Most High God.<br>My God is Jehovah Jireh (Genesis 22:13-14), meaning He is the Lord that provides. He is also El-Shaddai (Genesis 17:1, 35:11), meaning, He is the Almighty and All-sufficient One. He has immeasurable riches in His treasury. He declared that silver is His and gold belongs to Him (Haggai 2:8). He also said, <strong><em>“For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.”</em></strong> (Psalm 50:10). God's original intention was for man to partake of and control His immeasurable riches, especially on the earth (Genesis 1:26-30).<br>Beloved, if you are not truly born again, surrender your life to Christ now, and He will become your provider. He will release the access to riches without sorrow to you and will give you the power to get wealth (Deuteronomy 8:18). It shall be well with your finances this year and beyond, in Jesus' name.",

      "In continuation of the discussion about God's declaration that it shall be well with the righteous (Isaiah 3:10), it is important to note that the state of a person's health is another indicator of the fellow's wellness. An individual that is always in and out of the hospital because of health challenges cannot say that it is truly well with him or her. I declare in the mighty name of Jesus that from today onward, you will begin to live in sound health.<br>The story in our Bible reading for today reveals the healing power of our Lord Jesus Christ and also shows that sin can be a source for sickness. This is the reason theHoly Spirit through the writer of Acts 10:38 said:<br><strong><em>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</em></strong><br>For you to live a sickness-free life in this new year, you must desist from any sin that might exist in your life. Confess them to God, ask for His forgiveness, and genuinely repent from them. If you do not genuinely repent of any sin that exists in your life, you are setting yourself up for great torment by the devil, as Jesus told the sick fellow in our memory verse for today.<br>Jesus gave a parable about putting new wine into old wine bottles in Luke 5:36-38. You cannot receive a miracle from God and remain in a sinful state; it is like putting new wine in an old wine bottle. As Jesus warned in His parable, such a person will surely be destroyed.<br>In our Bible reading today, Jesus pronounced healing on the sick fellow and, after a while, upon seeing him again, gave him a warning that he should not commit sin again. A lesson here for us to learn is that it is not enough for a fellow to receive his or her healing or any other miracle and go about committing sin afterwards. Such a fellow will definitely lose the healing or miracle. As I have pronounced healing and sound health upon you today, may the Lord keep you away from sin so that you will not lose your miracles to it, in Jesus' name.",

God indeed desires that you should enjoy all-round wellness, and this includes recovering all that you might have lost to the enemy. I declare that you will recover all that you may have lost to the enemy, in Jesus' name.<br>Our Father in heaven said in His words, “I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:” (Isaiah 45:2). In other words, the Lord is assuring us of His presence as we pass through this new year. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave us an added assurance in John 16:33:<br><strong><em>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</em></strong><br>These infallible words in the Scriptures are an assurance to you that regardless of what you might have experienced in the last year, it shall be well with you in this new year.<br>Beloved, for it to be well with you this year, you must learn a lesson from our Bible text for today. David consulted God before pursuing the enemy, and God assured him of victory. I encourage you to cultivate the habit of seeking divine direction this year as you go about all your lawful endeavours. David, even though He was an army General of high repute, did not rush into pursuing those who raided his camp while he was away. Instead, he consulted with his Commander-In-Chief, Jehovah-Nissi, for divine assurance. God told him to pursue after the invaders, and when he did, he recovered all that they had stolen from him.<br>Are there things you know that the devil has stolen from you? Are there opportunities you believe you have lost? Are there steps you ought to have taken but failed to, and you feel all is over? I want to assure you today that my God can help you recover all if you trust Him and surrender all to Him.<br>I declare once again that as you truly surrender all to Jesus and seek His guidance, you will recover all the losses you may have suffered, and it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.",

      "I prophesy to you today that as you read this, a pleasant book of remembrance will be opened in your favour, in Jesus' name. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the word remember means to be able to bring back a piece of information into your mind or to keep a piece of information in your memory. In Genesis 8:1, the Bible says that God remembered Noah. Ordinarily, one cannot imagine that God can be forgetful and not remember the family He put in an ark. Thus, when the Bible said that God remembered Noah, it could only mean that God was now paying attention to Noah's situation. The same thing applied to Rachel in Genesis 30:22-23 where the Bible says:<br><strong><em>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and open her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son; and said God hath taken away my reproach:</em></strong><br>The above scripture reveals another meaning of remembrance: the taking away of reproach by a higher power. When God remembers a barren woman, she conceives and becomes a mother of children, like in the case of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1:1-28. She had been constantly provoked and humiliated by her rival because of her barrenness, and it seemed like her case was hopeless. However, God remembered her and intervened in her situation when she cried out to Him in Shiloh. When she returned to Shiloh, she was carrying her testimony in her hands.<br>In our Bible reading for today, God intervened in the case of Mordecai against his adversary, Haman. Mordecai and his niece, Esther, prayed, and there was a breakthrough. The king was unable to sleep, and he commanded that the record books be read to him. While this was being done, the good deed of Mordecai that had been forgotten was brought to remembrance. That could only have been God. Nehemiah understood the things that can happen when God remembers a fellow, and that was why he prayed that prayer in today's memory verse.<br>Beloved, I encourage you to ask that the Almighty God should open a book of pleasant remembrance for you this year. I join my faith with yours, and I pray that He will remember you for good all through this new year and beyond, in Jesus' mighty name.",

He also promised to wipe them off from the face of the earth. Many years after, their past evil action against the children of Israel was brought to remembrance, and the Lord commanded Saul to wipe them off the face of the earth. I pray that a negative book of remembrance will never be opened to you, in Jesus' name.<br>Beloved, a terrible book of remembrance was opened to all men because of the sin of the first man and woman in Genesis 3:19:<br><strong><em>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</em></strong><br>This terrible book of remembrance is re-echoed in Romans 3:23 and Romans 6:23.

Jesus' blood was shed on the cross at calvary to write off the consequences of this terrible book of remembrance for everyone who accepts Him as their Lord and Saviour. Beloved, if you have not truly surrendered your life to Jesus, there is no way you can escape the ultimate consequence of this terrible book of remembrance, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23). Surrender all to Jesus today and commit to living a holy life if you are yet to do so. Only then can you experience the mercy of God and have the book of life opened to you.<br>I declare that every evil book of remembrance concerning you shall be shut down permanently from today, in Jesus' name.",

      "Today, I will be discussing how needful it is for men to also open a book of remembrance of God's goodness so that they can give Him praise like the psalmist in our Bible reading today.<br>Over the years, I have come to realise that many people easily forget the goodness of God to them. For example, when things are going fine, it is easy for a fellow to be full of praise for his or her Maker. However, when things are not going well, the same fellow may momentarily forget all that the Lord has done for him or her and immediately begin to complain. David also realised this tendency in men to forget what God has done for them quickly, hence the reminder he set for himself in the memory verse of today.<br>After setting the reminder in Psalm 103:2 for himself, David went on to open the book of remembrance of God's blessings upon his life and began to praise Him (Psalm 103:3-5). He praised God for forgiving his sins, for healing him, and for saving him from destruction. He went further to praise God for crowning him with loving kindness and tender mercies. David also praised God for satisfying him with good things and for renewing his strength like the eagle's.<br>Beloved, it is very important that you always remember the goodness of the Lord upon your life. You were created in His image, and this is enough reason for you to thank Him at all times. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross of calvary for your sins and indeed the sins of the entire world is another major reason to be thankful to God at all times. You should thank Him always for saving you from the consequences of sin and all sorts of evil in the world today. Like David, you must give thanks to God for His loving kindness and tender mercies. The Bible says that you would have been consumed if not for His tender mercies (Lamentations 3:22), so you owe your continued existence to Him.<br>I am sure that I can go on and on, and I still will not be able to exhaust the list of reasons you should praise God at all times. Beloved, open a book of remembrance of the Lord's goodness over your life today and begin to praise Him.",

      "It may surprise you to know that God has best friends. God's best friends are so close to Him that they know things about Him that no one else knows. They are people with an experiential knowledge of Him that most people don't have. Such people don't like to talk deeply about how much of God they know because those who haven't gotten that close to Him will misunderstand them.<br>Abraham was one of God's best friends. He was so close to God that God said He could not do anything significant on earth without first informing him (Genesis 18:17). Moses was also one of God's best friends. He was so close to God that God Himself testified in Numbers 12:8 that He spoke to Moses mouth to mouth and that he beholdsHis similitude which is translated as 'form' in modern English. John the Beloved was another man who was clearly one of God's best friends. Of all the people on earth, Jesus decided to tell him all the things that will happen in the end time (Revelation 1:1).<br>All these people had such a close relationship with God that they saw sides of Him that others never saw. They heard things from Him that they never told others and made Him change His mind on several occasions (Genesis 18:24-32, Exodus 32:9-14). Probably the most obvious example is reflected in Jesus' relationship with Peter, James and John while He was on earth. Because they were with the Lord Jesus Christ on the mount of transfiguration, they saw His glory (Matthew 17:1-2). When He went to raise Jairus' daughter, He allowed only the three of them to follow Him, and so they saw His resurrection power (Mark 5:35-37). They were so close to Him that they saw Him in His time of distress at the garden of Gethsemane when He was crying for God to take away the cup from Him (Matthew 26:36-39). Jesus invited them specially to watch with Him. These three experienced special moments with Jesus Christ that no one else did.<br>It indeed is a special honour and privilege to be one of God's best friends. I believe every sincere believer should desire to be in God's special inner circle of friends, and so I will be discussing what it takes to become one of God's best friends in the next couple of days.",

      "From yesterday's discussion, I believe you must be very interested in becoming one of God's best friends. If you truly are, you must study those who have been best friends with Him and do what they did. One major thing you will notice about such people is a great level of faith. <br>Faith is a major attribute that is required of anyone who wants to become God's friend. Those who will be one of God's best friends will not only have faith but have so much faith that they will be doing things that do not seem to make sense according to human understanding. <br>Romans 4:18 says that Abraham hoped against hope – that is a great level of faith! He not only hoped in his heart, but it also showed in his action when he told everyone to start calling himself and his wife 'father of nations' and 'mother of nations' respectively, even when they were old and didn't have a child. Romans 4:19 says that he did not consider his body that it was dead; he believed God like a fool.<br>Can you have that much faith in God that you will begin to say and do things that would make people who do not understand God's ways wonder if you are normal? Will you see the word of God as more real and potent than anything else, including natural laws? When God sees this kind of faith in someone, He draws the fellow closer to Himself.<br>Early in my Christian walk, I learned during a Sunday School class that faith can be likened to when a child jumps from a high surface at his father's instruction without being scared of falling because he knows that his father will catch him. When I heard that, I started jumping without being scared of falling because I know from His word that He will catch me. I noticed that every time I made audacious statements or moves of faith based on God's word, He drew me closer to Himself.<br>You can have a close relationship with God if you can just be audacious with your faith. If you can hope against hope and become a fool to others because of what you so obsessively believe in the word of God, not only will you see His word come to pass in your life, but you will also discover that He has brought you close to Himself to make you one of His best friends.",

      "Many people want to be one of God's best friends so that whenever they ask Him for something, He will do it for them immediately. This is surely one of the benefits of being one of God's best friends, however, those who really become such care more about Him than they care about themselves.<br>The priorities of a man are known from his prayer points. If your prayers are always selfish, God will not make you one of His best friends. In fact, He will not answer your prayers when they are born out of your lusts (James 4:3).<br>Those who will be one of God's best friends are people who pray God's prayers and want to partner with Him to establish His will on earth. They are people who say regularly, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” When such people go to pray, they don't go with preconceived prayer points at all times. They make a habit of going into His presence with a burden to hear from Him about what He wants to be done on earth and to pray those things into existence.<br>Every now and then, God needs someone to stand in the gap for His people, He needs someone to pray about a particular situation so that He can have the legal right to step into that situation. If you are an intercessor, always willing to pray God's will into existence, He will draw you closer to Himself. He will tell you things that He usually doesn't tell others and show you sides of Himself that others don't see – He will even reveal His burdens to you! Only those who are willing to share in God's burdens can become one of His best friends.<br>In Matthew 26:36-39, Jesus' best friends saw His sorrow; they saw Him in His time of distress at the garden of Gethsemane when He was crying for God to take away the cup from Him and more importantly, to let His will be done. Jesus was the one who invited them to watch with Him; they were His prayer partners.<br>Can God invite you to watch with Him over a nation, His church or any matter at that? Can you forget all your prayer points and just keep praying for the will of God to be fulfilled like Jesus did in the garden of Gethsemane? Do you care more about God than you care about yourself?",

God's best friends are fruit-bearers; that is why He said in John 15:16 that if you bear fruits and those fruits abide, you can ask anything of Him, and He will do it.<br>God will prune you till you are genuinely humble. He will prune you till you are completely dead to the flesh. Once He marks you as someone to bring closer to Himself, He will start pruning you. This is where many people drop off His friends list because they cannot endure His pruning.<br>Many years ago, I was at an airport, and I was to declare all the money that I had with me. I only told the attendant about the notes and left out the coins. She told me to show her my purse, and I was embarrassed because I had to admit I had lied. The lady let it go, but I heard God's voice at that moment, “You are special to me, so I will not condone the smallest of lies from you.” If you really want to be one of God's best friends, you must be ready to meet His high standards.<br>Nobody can get close to God without going through intense discipline. You must be willing to submit to His discipline if you want to become His best friend. If God disciplines a person for doing something wrong and the person does not desist from committing that particular sin, He will eventually leave such a person as He cannot become friends with unrepentant people.<br>Once in a while, God tests His best friends. He takes them through a period of trials to prune them and make them perfect, wanting nothing (James 1:3-4). Only a few people go through these trials and come out on the other side perfect. Only a few people can submit to these tests without compromising their faith. Are you one of those people?<br>Beloved, it is true that divine pruning can be a painful exercise, so you must spend quality time in God's presence daily to build your spiritual strength.

      "Friendship is a very sensitive topic to discuss, especially in these last days when many have become lovers of themselves (2 Timothy 3:1-2). In spite of this, however, everybody still needs good friends. Some friends can be closer to you than a brother - you need one or two of such friends around you. Such friends will challenge you to do more for God and can tell you the truth when everyone else is afraid to do so. They are people that you can have as a shoulder to lean on when the chips are down.<br>Acts 3:1 says that Peter and John went to the temple. You may ask yourself, after the Holy Ghost descended on 120 people in Acts 2, why is the Bible bringing only these two to our notice? The reason, I believe, is that they were friends who were part of Jesus' inner circle. They were three in that circle – Peter, James and John. Out of these three, Peter and John had a close relationship even before Jesus died. If you read John 13:21-26, at the last supper, when Jesus said somebody was going to betray Him without telling them who it was, Peter beckoned to John and told him to ask Jesus. That is an example of a friend you can ask to pray for you concerning a matter you are not clear about, and he will hear from God for you.<br>After Jesus died and rose from the dead, the link between them obviously grew stronger. In John 20:1-8, when Mary Magdalene discovered that Jesus had risen and came to tell the apostles, two of the apostles ran to the tomb; they were Peter and John. It's interesting to note that John is the one who wrote the story, and he stressed that he outran Peter and got to the tomb first – in fact, he repeated it twice! I always wonder, “Why are you telling us that you beat him so emphatically?” There seemed to be a friendly competition as to who loved Jesus more between them.<br>You need friends you can have healthy competitions with on who can pray the longest, who reads more Scriptures, who wins more souls and so on. The link between Peter and John was strong, and it rested on their relationship with Jesus. You need friends whose link with you is majorly based on the link you both have with Jesus Christ.",

I know you can pray anywhere, and God will hear you, but there is a difference when you pray in the place that was originally assigned as the place of prayer. In such a place, the atmosphere is already charged, and there are heavenly protocols in place already to ensure that prayers said there are answered. When a place has been dedicated as a house of prayer, there is tremendous power there.<br>For many years when I lived in the house that is now known as Open Heavens House, I had a small room that I called my prayer room. It is a room that was assigned as a place to pray and meet with God. As a result of the constant prayers that went on there for long hours, a portal between heaven and earth was created there, just like the one we see in our Bible reading for today. Many people had prayed for certain situations without results, however, when they entered that room to pray, testimonies followed. For example, there have been records of people entering the prayer room with glaring physical defects, and by the time they would come out, the Lord would have touched them, and the defect would have disappeared. What made the difference was not so much in the words they said but that they prayed in a place that had become a portal between heaven and earth.<br>When a place has been dedicated as a place of prayer, and intense prayers have been going on there for many years, you better believe that such a place is saturated with immense power. You can pray on your own every day, but in addition to that, every time you have the opportunity to go to church to pray, please don't miss it.",

      "The temple is not just the house of prayer; it is also the house of healing. In Matthew 21:14, after Jesus chased all those who were buying and selling in the temple, saying, “My house shall be called the house of prayer,” the Bible says that the sick came unto Him in the temple and were healed.<br>In our Bible reading for today, Jesus went into the synagogue and met a man with a withered hand. There were some scholars who felt that people shouldn't be healed on sabbath days. When they asked if He would heal the man with a withered hand, He told the man to stretch his hand, and he was healed. Note that the man did not ask to be prayed for; just seeing a case like that in the temple compelled Jesus to heal him. Some people have challenged me before, saying: “You people who claim that you have the power to heal, why don't you go to the hospital and heal everybody there? Why do they have to come to the church to be healed?” Truly, God can heal anywhere, but He specifically heals in the temple. There are many people who, by just stepping foot on Redemption City, got their healing. Nobody prayed for them; the mere fact that they had entered God's temple brought them their healing.<br>Going to God's temple regularly is like going to the doctor regularly. Even when you are feeling well, and you go to see him, he will examine you, and whatever strange thing he finds in your body, he will deal with it. There are people that are carrying one sickness or the other in their bodies that they don't even know about yet. When you go to church, and the power of God falls on you, such sicknesses disappear because you have come to a place of healing. This is why I wonder if people know what they are missing when they decide to stay at home and watch a church service on TV. If you are far from the place of worship and God sees that you sincerely will like to attend physically but cannot be there, that is a different case. However, when you decide to stay at home and connect to a service that you could have easily attended, you cannot get the same atmosphere as those who are in the service physically.",

      "Beyond being the house of prayer and healing, God's temple is also the house of sacrifice. Anyone who wants to sacrifice anything has to take his sacrifice to a designated place. In Yoruba land, where I come from, when they want to sacrifice to the devil, they take the sacrifice to the crossroad, and when they want to sacrifice to witches and wizards, they put it behind an Iroko tree. For us who give sacrifices to the Most High God, He said in 2 Chronicles 7:12 that He has chosen His temple as the place where He will accept our sacrifices. Furthermore, Deuteronomy 16:16 says that you should not come empty-handed when you are coming to the temple of God because He wants to accept your sacrifice.<br>A friend of mine used to say whenever he was taking offerings, “If you have none, borrow from your neighbour so that when the basket is going round, God will see you putting something in.” Then he would add, “It will not be long before you too will lend to others.” God takes giving a sacrifice in His temple so seriously that He always observes what people drop in the offering basket. In Mark 12:41-44, Jesus watched the offerings that people gave and weighed which ones were sacrifices and which were not. This tells you clearly that God is keen on accepting sacrifices in His temple.<br>Some people say that because they don't trust their pastor, they will rather give to the poor than give in church. First, I don't understand why they have a pastor they believe to be a thief. Secondly, it is good to give to the poor; Proverbs 19:17 says that when you give to the poor, you are indirectly giving to God. However, you must never neglect giving your sacrifices in the house of God itself. If somebody says he likes me and gives my children money whenever he sees them by the roadside, but he refuses to give when he sees that there is a need in my family, despite knowing the way to my house and having money to give, I will begin to suspect such a fellow. It will be clear that he isn't giving to my children because he likes me but for other reasons. This might be because he just wants to be seen in public as a giver or that he wants to gain some undue influence over my children. It's the same when you claim to give to the poor in the name of God but never give in the house of God itself.",

      "God's temple is also the house of knowledge; it is a house of education. In Psalm 27:4, David made it clear: One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.<br>In the house of the Lord, you can behold the beauty of the Almighty God. However, David went on to say that he not only wants to behold God's beauty, but he also wants to be there to enquire of Him. In other words, if you have any questions for God, bring them to His temple; come and ask Him in the temple.<br>When you come into His temple, you will receive revelations; He will begin to tell you certain things that you will not learn at home. This is why you must always go to church with your writing materials. It is a place to go and learn new things and get new perspectives. There have been many times that I was confused about a matter, but while listening to the word of God, light will begin to shine on the matter, and I will receive revelations on how to resolve the situation. This is why the psalmist said:<br><strong><em>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</em></strong><strong>Psalm 119:105</strong><br>The house of God is a place where you go to hear the word of God, and in that word is great knowledge and wisdom that you cannot get anywhere else. So, whether you need revelation for business, family issues, ministry, health or any other field of life, you will get it in the house of God. Those who regularly go to a church where the undiluted word of God is taught don't stay confused for long.<br>You may, however, then ask, “How do I know if the word being taught in my church is genuine and undiluted?” You will have to emulate the Berean Christians who always returned to their homes to search the Scriptures to verify what they had been taught in church (Acts 17:10-11).<br>As long as you remain in the environment where the undiluted and genuine word of God is preached, knowledge and wisdom will be available to you.",

      "God's temple is also a house of grace. Hebrews 4:16 calls the temple the throne of grace. It is the place where you can go and obtain grace and mercy in times of need.<br>You may be in need of strength and grace to overcome a particular situation; the good news is that the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:9 that God's grace is sufficient for you, and His strength is made perfect in your weakness. You receive this sufficient grace when you come into His temple. People who go to the occult for power know that they have to keep visiting the shrine regularly to renew their powers. The devil only tries to copy God's methods; we who own the original must also always go to the temple of God to keep renewing our strength and receive fresh grace to surmount challenges that we may be faced with daily.<br>There are people who, when they have committed a sin, avoid going to church because they feel dirty – that is wrong. At that point, they need the mercy of God and where they can get it is at His throne of grace. That is the time they need to be in church the most. When you get to His throne of grace, go in humility. Even if you are a worker, don't try to keep up an appearance; tell God you have erred and that you are sincerely sorry. Tell Him to please have mercy on you.<br>Many people go to the temple and keep up appearances like the Pharisee in Luke 18:10-14, while some others go in like the Publican in the same passage. This is why many people keep going to church and are yet filled with so much junk within them. Even if you are the pastor of the church, when you are before the throne of grace and in need of mercy, don't put up a false appearance of piety; go before God pleading for mercy.<br>The devil knows that you can always access mercy and grace in the presence of God, so he will do everything he can to discourage you from coming unto Him. He used to have that privilege of being in God's presence, but he lost it when iniquity was found in him (Ezekiel 28:14-16), and of course, he does not want you to enjoy what he has lost.Beloved, don't let anything keep you away from coming into God's presence to access his mercy and grace.",

      "The temple of God is much more than all I have discussed in this series so far. In fact, if I want to call God's temple any particular name, I will probably call it the house of praise and power. In our Bible reading for today, you will discover why David said:<br><strong><em>I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</em></strong>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Psalm 122:1</strong><br>The temple is a house of praise. Psalm 22:3 says that God inhabits the praises of Israel, and we saw a manifestation of this in our Bible reading today. The temple is also the house of thanksgiving because our Bible reading passage today also says that they were thanking God too and not just praising Him (2 Chronicles 5:13). In fact, David says in Psalm 100:4 that you should enter God's gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise. As praise and thanksgiving go on, His glory fills the temple powerfully. So, when you go into the temple, you are actually going into God's glory. That glory rubs off on you, and everywhere you go after that, you just begin to experience supernatural goodness and mercy.<br>God's temple is also a house where goodness and mercy abound. In Psalm 23:6, the Bible says:<br><strong><em>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</em></strong><br>There is a song I love so much, and it goes thus:<br><em>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days, all the days of my life (2x).</em><em>And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever,</em><em>and I will feast at the table set for me.</em><em>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days,</em><em>all the days of my life (2x).”</em><br>Beloved, I encourage you to sing this song prophetically, and if you do not know the song, you can just speak the words into your life. You must, however, go beyond merely singing or speaking the words, you must live it. Dwelling in the house of the Lord precedes feasting at the table set before you. Whether the enemy likes it or not, when you are in the house of the Lord praising and thanking Him, a table will be set before you, and nothing can tamper with it!",

      "Whenever I insist that I am not a servant of God, but a son of God, some wonder if there's a difference between children of God and servants of God. Simply put, a son of God has several advantages that a servant of God does not have.<br>In John 8:35, the Bible says that, unlike a servant, a son abides in the house forever. A servant can resign or be sacked, but a son cannot be sacked. When a father says, “I reject you as my child, I disown you,” it is a joke because his blood is running in the child; he can't take the blood away. Hence, a child will always be in the house. The implications of this alone are many. Psalm 23:6, for example, says: “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.” The one who dwells in the house forever has the assurance that goodness and mercy shall follow him forever. Also, according to Psalm 91:1, “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.”<br>A servant is always a visitor; he comes into the presence of the master when he is needed and goes out when he is not needed. A son, however, is a dweller; he stays in the house all the time. Furthermore, according to John 5:20, the son sees everything that the father does; the servant does not see everything his master does. There is beauty and joy in knowing what God is doing and being able to see ahead of time what God is going to do. For example, years ago, when problems were brewing, I told those close to me, “Trouble is coming, but at the end of it, somebody is going to laugh,” and so it happened because I have the privilege as a son to see what my Father is doing.<br>There are certain things that can happen to servants that will never happen to children. For example, as good as Job was, God called him “My servant,” little wonder God allowed Satan to experiment with him (Job 1:8-12). My Father will never permit the enemy to experiment with my health, resources or anything that concerns me because I am His son.<br>Tomorrow, by His grace, I will commence a study on how to become a son of God.",

      "<p>Yesterday, I distinguished clearly between being a son of God and being a servant of God. I am quite sure that you choose to become a son of God rather than a servant. How then can you become a son of God?<br>Being a son of God requires that you fulfil some obligations. A son is a major stakeholder in whatever the father does. He takes whatever belongs to the father as his because he is not a servant but a son. John 10:12 says that the hireling (servant) will not give his life for the sheep, but Jesus, the Son of God, gave his life for the sheep. In the same vein, you must be ready to spend and be spent for the salvation of men on earth. Nothing must be too hard for you to do so that people will not perish in hell. A servant can see souls perishing and turn the other way, but not a son; a son will go out and preach the gospel to them until they give their lives to Christ and remain steadfast in the Lord. If you are not an incurable soul winner, your sonship is in doubt.<br>A son resembles his father. It is only what he sees his father do that he does. That is why 1 John 3:9 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</strong></i><br>True sons of God hate sin. Don't mind those who tell you that once you have given your life to Christ, you can go ahead and commit sin – they are liars! Real children of God have the seed of God in them, and that seed makes it difficult for them to sin. If they fall into sin, that seed begins to bite them, and they become very sorry for what they have done. They go back to their Father, like any genuine child will do, and plead for forgiveness. Nobody can keep committing sin on purpose and claim to be a son of God – that fellow is a liar. A child that does not resemble his father is called a bastard.<br>It was recorded that Jesus loved righteousness and hated iniquity (Hebrews 1:8-9). If you are truly a child of God, you will hate sin and love righteousness because of His seed within you.</p>",

First, you don't joke with your quiet time with Him. That is when it is just you and Him in the morning, conversing. That is when you study your Bible and pray. You should start your day with Him and become addicted to speaking to Him every morning. Beyond that, don't make any decision without first asking for His input. You should ask Him for which outfit to wear, which route to take on your way to work, and so on. When you live basically on His voice, you are dwelling in His presence continually. Psalm 10:4 says that those who don't have God in all their thoughts are proud and wicked.<be>God must be in all your thoughts. He must be the motivation behind everything you do. Everything you do must be done for His glory. 1 Corinthians 10:31 says:<br><strong><em>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</em></strong><br>A son is always seeking to glorify his Father's name. He never wants to do anything that will make people say, “And you call yourself a child of God.” As such, he lives conscious of whose he is. He doesn't do anything that is outside the leading of his Father because he never wants to leave the presence of his Father.<br>When you read Mark 15:34-37, you will see that it was when Jesus saw that the Father had forsaken Him that He gave up the ghost. He could bear all the pain as long as God was with Him, but the moment He saw that He was no longer in the presence of His Father, He gave up the ghost. That is how addicted you must be to God's presence. If you are a son of God, abiding in his presence must be like breathing to you.",

By the grace of God, I will never become a prodigal son, in Jesus' name. I'll encourage you to say the same prayer for yourself.</p><p><br>When God blesses me, I will not squander His blessings; I will use them for His work. Some people believe that the only way you can show that God is blessing you is by showing off: wearing golden shoes and clothes, and walking as if you own the whole world. These are the attributes of people that are referred to as prodigal sons, and I have made up my mind never to become such. What about you?</p><p><br>Another category of children that the Bible talks about are those that bring grief to their fathers. The Bible says that a foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him (Proverbs 17:25). I have equally made up my mind never to be one of such, in Jesus' name. Psalm 14:1 says that the fool is one who says that there is no God, and it goes on further to say that a fool is a corrupt person. I acknowledge God in all that I do, and I refuse to be corrupt. I will never cause my Father in heaven grief. What about you?&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you go to Matthew 3:16-17 however, the Bible talks of 'My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.' This is the kind of son I want to be. I want to be the kind of son that God will look down on and say, “This one, I love him.” You can be that kind of friend too. God has had sons who became friends over the ages. Abraham was a friend of God (Isaiah 41:8), and I am sure He is also saying, “Adeboye is my friend.”</p><p><br>You can tell who will become a beloved child of God as well as His friend by how much time they are willing to spend in His presence. The kind of sons that yearn for a close fellowship with God and desire to please Him at all times are the ones who don't just read the Bible but also study and meditate on it daily so as to know God more and draw closer to Him.</p>",

From the moment I learnt that it is possible to be a favourite of God, someone from whom God will never hide anything, I decided to get so close to God that I will become His favourite. Do you also want to be God's favourite? You must note that it will cost you something.&nbsp;<br>Many times, when we talk about how a Christian should behave, dress, and act, some people will say, “God is not that difficult, He is a God of love. Where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty.” I always say, “We shouldn't quarrel about it, live your life the way you want to live it. It all depends on how close you want to be to God.”<br>For example, if all you want in life is to become an Office Assistant, then you don't need to attend a higher institution. All you need to know is how to run basic errands, and you will achieve your goal. However, if you want to become a professor, then you will enrol in tertiary institution and burn the midnight oil. I want to be a professor for God, I want to get close to Him, and I want to be His favourite. I don't want to be just a servant of God, I don't want to be just a son, I don't want to be just a friend, I want to be a favourite, and by the grace of God, that is what you will be also, even though it is going to come at a cost.<br>Becoming one of God's favourites will cost you your time. Those who become God's favourites spend more time with God than they spend with anyone or anything else. Becoming God's favourite will also cost you your appetite. You must be ready to fast like no man's business if you want to draw closer to God than majority of others ever will. It will also cost you material things because you must hate the things of this world and prioritise the kingdom of God. James 4:4 says friendship with the world is enmity with God. Matthew 6:24 further says that you must choose between God and mammon. You must reject mammon to become close to God. Are you willing to pay the price to become God's favourite? I am</p>",

Clearly, that was the working of miracles.<br> When you get baptised in the Holy Ghost, you carry divine power within you. You have the power to work miracles, heal the sick and raise the dead. Unfortunately, many Christians become baptised and are satisfied with just speaking in tongues. You received more than that when you were baptised in the Holy Spirit; you received the power to go out and do the work of God. <br>Many years ago, I prayed to God for many weeks for power to do His work, but He didn't respond. At last, one night, He told me to keep quiet and began to ask me some questions. “Have you been baptised in the Holy Ghost?” I said, “Yes”. He said, “What is written in Acts 1:8?” I knew it offhand, so I quoted it to Him. Then He said, “You received power after your baptism in the Holy Ghost.” I responded, “Lord, but I don't feel powerful.” He replied, “Did I say the just shall live by feelings?” <br>The next morning, a sick child was brought to me for prayers. I was afraid, but then I remembered the conversation I had with God the previous night, so I laid my hands on the child and prayed. Not long after, I felt the child go numb, and I thought to myself, “Has this child died?” When I finished praying and opened my eyes, I realised that the child was sound asleep. The mother said that the child had not slept in days, but now, she was sure that God had healed her child. <br>Go out and use the power that God has already given to you, if not, it will remain dormant. When I realised that I had been empowered by God, I was hungry to keep laying hands on the sick. That is how I've gotten to the stage where many great miracles happen through me today. I have been using the power God gave me since I was baptised in the Holy Spirit and it has been growing since then.",

      "<p>In the Bible reading for today, peter confronted the sadducees defending his faith and in the name of jesus Christ. However, was Peter this bold before he was baptised in the Holy Spirit? The simple answer is, “No”.</p><p><br>In Matthew 14:28-32, Peter was described as being 'afraid' after he saw the boisterousness of the wind. In John 18:16-27, when servants recognised him as one of Jesus' followers, he denied it and swore that he did not know Jesus. This same Peter was now the one confronting Sadducees.</p><p><br>In Acts 4:10, the one who denied Jesus Christ said, “The same Jesus you crucified, God has raised Him from the dead, and it is through Him that this lame man is standing before you whole.” He added that there is no other name given unto men by which anybody can be saved but by Jesus – he was now standing solidly behind Jesus Christ. The Peter after Pentecost was different from the Peter before Pentecost. He was now bold and could speak about Jesus Christ to anyone regardless of their status in the society.</p><p><br>Acts 4:13 says that the boldness of Peter and John was beheld by the people around them. In other words, their boldness became very obvious. What was responsible for this kind of boldness? The answer to this question can be found in Acts 4:8:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel…&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Being filled with the Holy Ghost is the antidote for fear. If fear has been holding you back from fulfilling your destiny, it is because you are not yet filled with the Holy Ghost. When you become filled with the Holy Ghost, you will look at the biggest obstacle in front of you and smile because you know that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Whenever fear tries to creep into your heart, start speaking in the Holy Ghost. Speak in tongues to the point where you ascend above the level of that fear. The Holy Spirit gives you the boldness to surmount any obstacle that may be standing in your path, no matter how big it may appear. Pray in the Holy Ghost every day, study your Bible, and have the Holy Ghost lead you. Make the Holy Ghost your companion at all times, and fear will become a stranger to you</p>",

      "<p>Revival is here and only those who are prepared will be a part of it. God is doing a new thing and He wants to use willing vessels, not just pastors and men of God, but also ordinary people that are filled with the Holy Ghost. If you have not yet been baptized in the Holy Ghost, you better ask Him for the baptism. A big revival is here, and He doesn't want to use the pastors alone; he wants to use all His willing and available children. The question, however, is, are you fit for the Master's use?</p><p><br>There are two major things you need to be fit for the Master's use in this revival. They are stated in 2 Timothy 2:21:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If a man therefore purge himself from these,he shall be a vessel unto honour,sanctified,and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The first thing you must do is purge yourself of any iniquity – you must be sanctified. Sanctification comes through constant study and dependence on the word of God (John 17:17).</p><p><br>Secondly, you must be prepared to work. God cannot use you if you are lazy, He only uses people that are prepared to work hard. Proverbs 18:9 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</strong></i><br><br>God describes the lazy man as being just the same as a waster. God won't waste His anointing on you if you are lazy. When He gives you the anointing, it is not the time to relax but the time to work even harder.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, it takes hard work to become a champion, but it takes even harder work to remain one. When you are struggling to become a champion, you stretch yourself and train vigorously. Once you become one, you will suddenly realise that from that moment, everybody starts coming after your crown to take it from you. Clearly, it is better not to have become a champion than to be an ex-champion while still at one's prime. The pain of the ex-champion is not the bruises on his body, it is the shame of walking in the streets and seeing those that had been hailing him as a champion suddenly turn their faces away from him.</p>",

      "John 1:12 says:<br><strong><em> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</em></strong><br> If you have received Christ into your heart and you believe in His name, not just in word, but in deeds such that everyone around you can see from your lifestyle that you are a believer in Christ, then you qualify to be called a child of God.<br> On the other hand, the Bible says that the devil has his own children too. Jesus Christ was addressing the Pharisees and He said to them in John 8:44:<br><strong><em> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</em></strong><br> The question then is, how do we tell a child of God apart from a child of the devil? The Bible answers this question aptly. For example, the Bible says that people who love the world do not have the love of God in them (1 John 2:15- 16). This clearly implies that such people cannot be described as God's children. When you see someone who loves material things more than God, that fellow does not have the love of God in him and hence cannot be His child if he or she remains in that state. <br>A child of God on the other hand is one who is born of the Spirit and focuses on spiritual things rather than worldly things. John 3:3-7 says that anyone who wants to enter into the kingdom of God must be born of the Spirit, and of course, only the children of God can enter into His kingdom. This is why you must be born again.<br> Beloved, when you are born again, you are born of the Spirit, and you truly become a child of God. When you are born of the Spirit, you will begin to live by the Spirit and be led by Him. You will begin to exhibit the fruit of the Spirit as written in Galatians 5:22-23. Remember, it is the kind of fruit you produce that will determine who your father truly is.",

It says that you will find some vessels unto honour and some unto dishonour. This may make you wonder, why does the great man keep vessels unto dishonour in his house, why doesn't he just throw them away? This is the same question that many ask when they consider the body of Christ today. They say, “Why does God not kill all fake pastors? Why does He not expose all those who are using His name to amass wealth and fame for themselves?” The answer to that is in Matthew 13:24-30. Verses 29 and 30 in particular say:<br><strong><em> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</em></strong><br> Our God does not act rashly; everything He does is for a reason. There are some fake pastors that some genuine Christians believe to be real. If God destroys such pastors, it could affect the faith of those who are following them. As such, the tares would have been gathered but the wheat would have unfortunately been rooted up with them. Don't worry about the mixed multitude in the church, God is coming to separate the wheat from the tares and when He does, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br> If you claim to be a Christian, yet you are bringing dishonour to the Lord, you better change now. If such a person refuses to change, that is not a problem. The fire that will consume him or her is getting hotter every day. Such a person can keep enjoying the benefits of being called a Christian for now, however, God is coming with the reward for such deceivers, and on that day, He will take no apologies. <br>Beloved, if you are one of such deceivers, it is in your best interest to genuinely repent now, forsake your sinful ways, and truly surrender your life to Jesus Christ. It is the only way to escape the judgment that is coming for all those that are vessels unto dishonour.",

      "<p>If God is ever going to use you to bring a harvest of souls into His kingdom,then you must be hardworking. This is because harvesting requires way more labour than sowing. Farmers will tell you that sowing is hard work; if you are going to sow on a large farm, you are going to work hard. However, reaping involves more hard work. This is because there is a time limit for harvesting. If you don't harvest within the time limit, the fruits will rot. The harvest of souls that God has prepared in this end-time revival is great and we have limited time. I pray that God will give you the grace to bring in the harvest, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;<br>When Peter cast his net into the sea in Luke 5:1-10, he did it alone without help, but when the harvest came, he realised that he needed more effort to bring it in. Proverbs 12:27 says that the slothful man will not roast the meat he caught while hunting. Do you know what that means? It takes hard work to hunt and harder work to prepare what was caught so it will not rot. God is not going to waste His anointing on a man who will win souls and not follow them up.<br>Soul winning is an easier job than following up new converts till they mature in Christ. This is why some people prefer the work of the evangelist to that of a pastor. The evangelist gets on a podium, preaches the gospel of salvation, makes an altar call, and leaves thereafter, leaving the pastor to do the hard work of training the new converts, setting them in systems that will help them grow spiritually, answering all their questions, and teaching them regularly until they can stand on their feet. In a time of revival, you must not only be ready to do the work of an evangelist but that of a pastor as well. John 15:16 says that you must win souls and ensure that they abide, implying that they never return to the devil.&nbsp;<br>As painful as it is, giving birth is still easier than taking care of a baby until adulthood. Parents will tell you that the work of a mother over her children never ends. Are you ready to nurture new converts till they make it to heaven? If your answer is yes, then God will really find you useful for His work.</p>",

He said pastors, and this includes anyone God has put in charge of others, should feed the sheep. When they fail to do so, they are invariably scattering the sheep, and there are woes in store for such persons. He said in verses 7 and 8 that He doesn't just want to be known as the God who brought His children out of Egypt (the bondage of the enemy) but as the Lord who brought His children out of bondage and brought them to their own land (Zion or Heaven).<br> God is never satisfied with you just preaching to sinners. Beyond encouraging them to confess their sins and give their lives to Christ, He is more interested in you following them up until they see Him in glory. Learn from the apostles of old; after Paul had won souls in a place, he would stay with them for a while to ensure that they become grounded in the faith (Acts 18:11, Acts 19:10, Acts 28:29-32). Even after he left, he would keep sending them letters to strengthen them even more. Those are the origins of the letters that we read in the Scriptures today and which strengthen us to date. He also often made out time to visit them so that they may be further established (Romans 1:11). In Acts 15:36, the Bible says:<br><strong><em> And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</em></strong><br> Relating this to modern times, after you have won a soul, get their contact details so that you can keep calling them and sending text messages to strengthen them. You must also visit them to see how they are faring. Visit the local assembly they attend to see if they have joined the workforce there and if they are fervently serving God. Give them the opportunity to ask you questions about their walk with God. New converts always have lots of questions to ask; be there to answer their questions and explain the Scriptures to them. Don't leave them to become prey to the devil; follow them up so well until they are fully established in Christ.",

Apostle Paul said, “Follow me as I follow Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). The secrets of people's successes lie in the things they do daily. If you can find those things and do them, you will also produce similar results. Romans 2:11 says:<br> <strong><em>For there is no respect of persons with God.</em></strong><br> Our God is not partial; the success He gave to that fellow you admire, He can give to you too if you will do the needful. Genesis 4:6-7 says:<br> <strong><em>And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.

In a book, you can learn within one hour things that took a man 70 years to learn. Once you have learnt them, you just have to put them to use and you will get the same results; there's no need for trial and error. This is one of the beauties of the Scriptures and I believe it is the reason the stories of great prophets of the past were recorded for us to read. James 5:10 says:<br><strong><em> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</em></strong><br> You are to take the men of God that have gone before as examples to follow, just as Paul stated in the memory verse for today.

This is what happens when God carries you; you become blessed by Him.<br> Exodus 19:4 says:<br> <strong><em>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. </em></strong><br>Some people don't know the real meaning of 'God bless you.' After you have said, “God bless you,” they still say, “Pray for me.” Being blessed by God is a summon to all the forces in heaven, on earth, and underneath the earth to assist you to succeed – that is the meaning of 'God bless you.' Believe it or not, even demons will be summoned to assist you when God is carrying you. <br>A few years ago, I was in an African nation for a programme. As we were heading to the venue of the crusade, we encountered a serious traffic jam. Even though we got a Police escort to help clear the traffic on the way to the venue, we were still stuck as nobody was obeying the Police escort. All of a sudden, a madman came to the front of the car we were in and began to clear the way. The man was so mad that if you looked into his eyes, you could see devils dancing in them. He cleared the way until we got to the end of the traffic jam. When the road was free, he came to the side of the car I was sitting in and bowed. When God carries you, everything will work together in your favour.<br> If you want God to carry you, you must become like a child. In our Bible reading for today, there were many adults around, but the only ones Jesus carried were the children. If you are not like a child, you will be too heavy for Him to carry. This means that you must be humble, obey His word, not hold grudges, and have faith in Him like a child that believes whatever his father tells him",

      "From today's Bible reading, we see that when God beckons on you, it is an invitation to rest.<br> There is a difference between hard labour and other types of work. God expects you to work. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says that if you don't work, you are not to eat. However, labourers, especially those who labour at menial jobs work from sunrise to sundown. At the end of the day, they earn just enough money to keep body and soul together. I decree that you will no longer struggle before you eat, in Jesus' name.<br> One of the reasons you are reading this now is because God beckoned on you. When He beckons, He is saying, “Destiny is calling you.” In Exodus 3:1-10, Moses was at the backside of the desert when he suddenly saw a bush that was burning but was not consumed. He said, “I will turn aside and see.” That was a beckoning, and by the time He responded, God told him that his days of staying in the wilderness were over, and it was now time to fulfil his destiny. In Mark 3:13-15, Jesus went to the top of a mountain and beckoned to those He desired and they came unto Him. Those people (except Judas Iscariot) later became the Apostles we know today. <br>The first thing you are to do when He beckons is to take up His yoke, in other words, make His desire your concern, and pursue the things He pursues. When you think of the greatest thing that God pursues, it is souls. If you really want to fulfil your destiny, you will take up the yoke of winning souls, and you will begin to see how He arranges things for you to fulfil your destiny. <br>My major pursuit was to become the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa, but God beckoned on me, and I took up His yoke of winning souls. That is how I got to fulfil my destiny and now Vice Chancellors call me Daddy. You have no idea what your true destiny is until you start winning souls and doing the work of God.<br> Just in case you think soul winning is only for evangelists and pastors, please study Matthew 28:19-20 carefully. All followers of Jesus Christ are commissioned to make disciples of all the nations, and this includes you.",

      "If God has called you for an assignment, you may be thinking, “Why is it me He chose out of everyone that could have done this work?” Well, Psalm 115:3 says that God does as He pleases.<br>Believe me, He made that decision to use you for that assignment from the foundation of the world. He chose you before He said, “Let there be light” in Genesis 1:3. Ephesians 1:4 says:<br> <strong><em>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</em></strong><br>When I see people that are anxious about their future, I tell them, “Relax. Do you think God doesn't know what to do? Do you think He is sitting in heaven, scratching His Almighty head and asking for advice on what next to do?” God settled your future before the foundation of the earth. This is why I am not worried; my future was settled before I was born. This is why you should be humble because you didn't choose yourself (John 15:16). You are not chosen because you are educated or connected, it is the exact opposite.<br>1 Corinthians 1:27 says that God chooses the foolish things, the weak things, and the things that are nought. If God chose you, it means you are foolish by human standards; you are weak, and you are nothing by human standards. Even if it appears as if you are wise by human standards, the moment you surrender all to God and begin to live strictly by His standards, the world will begin to see you as a foolish person. So, never raise your head in pride about your achievements. Nebuchadnezzar tried it and found himself in the bushes. For the rest of your life, you must be grateful to God. David said in Psalm 34:1:<br> <strong><em>I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth.</em></strong><br> David knew what he was talking about. God chose Him to be the king of Israel even when his family members would not have voted for him if he ran for elections. I believe that right now, God is talking to you concerning this because of how high He wants to take you. If you listen and become humble, then He will lift you, but if you refuse to humble yourself, then you will be abased (Matthew 23:12). Let pride disappear from your life completely.",

      "The best promotion anyone can have is that which comes from God; nobody can take glory for such. In 1 Samuel 16:1-13, a shepherd boy was anointed to be king, not because somebody liked him or spoke for him, but because God decided to promote him. I believe God wants to promote someone reading this today and that will be you, in Jesus' name.<br> When God begins to promote a man, there is no telling how high He can take him, because His arms are everlasting (Deuteronomy 33:27). 1 Samuel 2:8 says that He can pick a beggar from the dunghill and continue to lift him until he begins to sit amongst princes – that is real promotion.<br> My father was so poor that poor people called him poor. The day he bought an umbrella there was jubilation in our home as if we had just bought a new house. If God could pick the son of a poor farmer and cause him to be someone that Heads of States will be delighted to meet, then you really cannot tell how high He can lift you. He promoted David from being the least recognised member of his family until he became the father of the King of kings (Revelation 22:16). <br>Now that you know that there is no limit to how far God can take you, the next thing you must ask is, “How can I become a candidate for divine promotion?” The first thing you need for God to choose you for promotion is mercy. He said in Romans 9:15 that He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy. He is sovereign; He chooses to promote whomever He pleases. One kind of person, however, that I know God will never ignore is one with a broken and contrite heart (Psalm 51:17). This is when a fellow's will is so broken that all he or she desires is to please God at all times. Such a person never wants to offend God, and whenever they mistakenly offend Him, they become sorrowful and immediately ask for forgiveness. <br>This is the kind of person God was searching for when He needed someone to become the king of Israel. He said in Acts 13:22 that He had found a man who will do all His will. This is the kind of person God will promote. If you are like that, then you have become a candidate for divine promotion.",

      "I have seen people who help others and at every opportunity, refer to the time they helped them. That is a very terrible thing to do, and it is not how God taught us to do good. Jesus said in Matthew 6:3 that when you give alms, you must not let anyone else know about it. In Matthew 5:16, He said that as your light shines and people see your good works, they must glorify God. In other words, you are not to seek any glory for yourself as a result of the good works that you do; all the glory must be to God and God alone.<br> When you help someone, and you go back to tell the fellow, “Remember how I helped you that other time,” you are indirectly trying to make them your prisoner. Don't ever make anyone feel like they owe you because you helped them at one time or the other. When you do good, do it unto God. Don't become a pain in somebody's neck or a source of remembering their shame just because you once helped them. You must note that it is God who ordained for you to perform that good deed for that fellow. He already planned on doing it, you were only privileged to be the one He chose to use. Ephesians 2:10 says:<br><strong><em> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</em></strong><br> If God created you for good works and ordained that you walk in them, and you turn around to announce the good works as your own doing, proclaiming yourself as the helper of someone else's destiny, what you are doing is trying to take God's glory, and if you know anything about God at all, you will know that He does not share His glory with any man. Isaiah 42:8 says: <br><strong><em>I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</em></strong><br> Don't try to contend with God over the good things He is doing in the lives of others through you. You are merely His vessel and all the glory must Go to Him. This way, you will receive rewards for the good that you have done rather than face consequences for trying to take His glory.",

There are some other people, however, who hardly do anything, even in the department where they claim to function. Worse still, there are people who are members of the workforce on paper, but physically, they are nowhere to be found. They hardly attend workers' meetings not to talk of actually working for God. I don't know which of these categories you belong to, but if you are not so active that people can easily notice your absence, then you need to do better. <br>The first set of church workers in the Bible were the seven deacons mentioned in Acts 6:5. Phillip was one of them, and in Acts 21:8, he had become someone referred to as the evangelist. The Bible specifically referred to him as 'the evangelist', which means that there might have been 'an evangelist', or 'some evangelists', but he was 'the evangelist'. Furthermore, the passage referred to him as being one of the seven to remind us that he was one of seven deacons that were chosen. However, asides Stephen and Phillip, we never heard of the rest.<br> One of my grandchildren once asked me, “Grandpa, do you know the Bible very well?” I said, “Yes” then she asked, “Who is Prochorus?” I said, “I don't know him”. She said, “What about Timon?” I said, “You mean Simon?” She said, “No, Timon”. I replied, “I don't know Timon either.” Then she said, “Prochorus and Timon were ordained along with Stephen and Phillip as deacons.” I said, “Is that so? God have mercy on Prochorus. I know Stephen, I know Phillip, but this Prochorus fellow, what did he do that is worthy of note?” In the same vein, when your name is mentioned in your local assembly, can people recognise the things you do that are worthy of note? <br>This is not to say that you must go around trying to show everyone that you are working. However, your impact must be felt in the department where you choose to work. For example, if you are in the sanitation department, everyone must know that if you are around, the church is always sparkling clean. Make so much impact that it is impossible to deny your relevance in the house of God.",

      "Hebrews 11:6 says that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. You only reward someone who has done something of good report and has done it well, therefore, what the passage is really telling us is that God wants people to seek Him diligently. This is why God told David clearly to seek His face, and what was David's response?<br><strong><em> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</em></strong> Psalm27:8 David said, “God, when you ask me to seek your face, my heart says, 'Your face will I seek.'” Today, God is asking you to spend time seeking His face. What will your response be?<br> You seek God through Bible study and prayers. While others do these things like every other activity, those who diligently seek God go the extra mile. They study their Bible for hours, going deeper and deeper into just one topic until they really understand God's mind about that topic. To them, prayer is not an event, it is a lifestyle. Every time you see them, they are praying because 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says that we must pray without ceasing. When they actually set out time to pray, they don't just put words together, they pour out their hearts to God and their major yearning is, “Lord, I want to know You more.” They spend multiple hours just having heart-to-heart talks with God.<br> Beloved, seek God's face daily until you fall asleep and even while you are sleeping. Solomon said that even when He is sleeping, his heart is awake, and can hear his beloved asking to come in unto him (Song of Solomon 5:2). David also described how he thinks about God on his bed at night and how his soul follows hard after God in Psalm 63:6-8. These are descriptions of how true love is expressed. Is this also your experience with God as your beloved?<br> There is great reward in diligently seeking the Lord. Beloved, spend your days seeking God and God alone. Seek Him while you are eating; let all your yearning be for Him. When you diligently seek Him, He will open Himself up in ways that the regular Christian may never see. There are things God has revealed to me in the Spirit that I cannot share publicly because people who have not sought Him diligently may never understand.",

      "To live and survive on this earth, you need more than food. Jesus said in Matthew 4:4 that you need every single word that proceeds out of God's mouth. This implies that you must be very particular about hearing from God regularly. Many people think that prayer is a one-way traffic, that is, they go to God, tell Him all their problems, and that is all. No! The most important part of prayer is hearing what God has to say concerning situations. It is the entrance of His word that brings light (Psalm 119:130).<br> Many times, when I face a difficult situation, and I cry to God for help and he does not say anything back to me, I say, “I'm in trouble,” and I continue crying unto Him. When at last I hear from Him, then I know that the problem is over. Even if what I hear is a rebuke, the fact that He is answering at all shows that He has heard me and that something is going to happen.<br> The Bible recorded in 1 Samuel 30:1-18 how David and his men had lost their family members and possessions to the Amalekites and how they recovered all after seeking guidance from God. It was a very dark moment for them before God spoke to them. The men had cried themselves sore and were so dejected that they began to contemplate killing David. Thankfully, David acted wisely and sought the face of God on what to do, and when they acted on God's counsel, they recovered all.<br> In the memory verse for today, Habakkuk said that he will stand upon his watch to see what God's response to him will be. Beloved, what is God saying about the prayer requests you have put before Him? What is God saying about your family, your future, and your career? If you are a child of God, you should note that God also wants to speak to you concerning your situation. Unfortunately, many believers fail to wait on Him to hear what He has to say to them. <br>In Jeremiah 33:3, God said, “Call on me and I will answer.” He didn't say, “I may answer” or “I will consider answering.” He said, “I WILL answer.” So, when you go to Him in prayers, tell Him, “Lord, I will not rest until you have answered me.”<br><br>",

      "I have come to understand that the difference between the right and the left hand is more than their positioning on our bodies. For example, in Matthew 5:30 when Jesus was talking about everything you must do to make sure you don't miss heaven, He said, “If thy right hand offend thee...” He could easily have said, “If thy hand,” but He obviously emphasised the right hand because of its importance. In Genesis 48:8-20 when Jacob was to bless Joseph's two sons, he deliberately placed his right hand on the younger son and the left on the older son. As a result of this, the younger son became more blessed than his elder brother (Deuteronomy 33:17). <br>Now, if the right hand of a man is that powerful, then you can imagine how powerful God's right hand is since we were made in His image (Genesis 1:26). <br>Psalm 17:7 says that God saves by His right hand. In other words, when a sinner is snatched from the jaws of hell, it is God's right hand at work. This is why you must pray for God to raise His right hand on behalf of all your family members that are not saved. Furthermore, Psalm 139:10 says that He leads by His right hand. Isaiah 41:10 says that God also upholds with His right hand. After He has saved you and led you with His right hand, He will also keep you standing with the same right hand. <br>In Exodus 15:6, the Bible says that His right hand is not just powerful, but also glorious in power. This tells us that God fights with His right hand. In Exodus 15:11- 12, the Bible says that His right hand swallowed the enemy. In Mark 14:62, the Bible tells us that the right hand of God is the right hand of power. The right hand of God is also where you will find joy and everlasting pleasures (Psalm 16:11). <br>Beloved, you should note, however, that only the redeemed can be at the right hand of God (Matthew 25:34). If you are not yet born again, you better surrender your life to Christ now because those who are at God's left hand suffer greatly. They are the ones who weep and gnash their teeth because of the evils they experience. Give your life to Christ today and get on the right-hand side of God.",

      "Many people that are living in the world today are carried away by the pleasures of sin. They think they are living the life now, but they have forgotten that they should be more concerned with their end than their present state. The time we have on earth is like a passing wind. There is a place where everyone will report to when they close their eyes in death, and we will all be in that place for eternity. My question to you now is, when you get to eternity, on what side will you be, on the side of heaven or hell?<br>The Bible says that when the Lord shall return, He is going to separate the people into two; the sheep will be on His right-hand side and the goats on the left (Matthew 25:31-46). Ask yourself sincerely, “Which side of God will I be at the end?” It is not where I am now that matters most, but where I will end up in eternity. One reason I am not afraid of death is because I am sure that dying in this world only gives me access to the eternal presence of God in heaven. If you are not sure where you will go when you leave this world, then you should be afraid of death. The interesting thing is, whether you fear death or not, everyone has an appointment with it that cannot be missed. When that day comes, I hope you will be on the right-hand side of God.<br>If you are standing for God now, please keep standing. Pray to God that He keeps you standing unto the end because it doesn't matter how long anyone may have served God, if he backslides and death catches up with him in his backslidden state, he will perish in hell as we see in Ezekiel 18:24:<br><strong><em>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</em></strong><br>On the other hand, someone may have been a sinner all his life, but close to when he is to die, if he repents and begins to live like Christ, that fellow will make it to heaven at the end (Ezekiel 18:21-22). It is only those who endure unto the end that will be saved (Matthew 24:13).",

      "When I realised that if God hadn't found me, I would have remained as a university lecturer heading towards hell, I made up my mind not to be an ordinary Christian. A mathematician who doesn't want to be ordinary will study those who excelled and reached the top, like Pythagoras and other great mathematicians. As I didn't want to be an ordinary Christian, I spent three years studying some people who God used mightily. One of such was Elijah. If you have listened to my series of sermons titled 'Going Higher' (they can be found on Dove TV's YouTube channel) you will know that I have spent a lot of time studying Elijah. I also studied Paul because he was an academic, a professor of law that went into ministry like me and ended well. I found out that according to 2 Timothy 4:6- 8, he was a diligent man.<br>Paul was diligent in every facet of his life. In Acts 28:1-6, when there was a shipwreck on the Island of Malta, while everyone was gathered around the fire because of the cold, it was Paul who went out to fetch firewood. In the earlier days, during the RCCG conventions, my boys and I used to fetch firewood for the conventions. We also washed plates and did other menial work with joy. Whenever it was time to wash plates and anyone wanted to collect the sponge from me, I would tell them, “Wash your own portion of plates, let me wash mine.” The hands that cannot do manual labour for the kingdom cannot heal the sick. When a programme is going on in your church, do not shy away from doing menial work. Get your hands dirty, and you will be amazed how the anointing will begin to surge through your fingers.<br>Many of the Assistant General Overseers in RCCG now were my boys in those days. This is because it is those you knew to be diligent when you were starting out that you can trust to remain diligent when you are successful. I have seen people advise that there are lots of people with great callings these days. They may have a calling, but have they been tested? Your calling is never enough to succeed. Can we put you in charge of something and go to sleep knowing that you will do the work as it should be done? Only those who are diligent can make full proof of their calling.",

      "When I studied those who had gone ahead of me in ministry, I discovered that many of them got promises from God concerning the assignment He called them to do. For a long time, however, their situation did not look like the promises they received, yet, they kept doing the work and, after some time, saw God fulfil His promise.<br>When God calls you for an assignment, He will show you the exciting end results. However, when you begin to walk in that calling, you will start to see tough situations that you must go through to get the results He promised. Joseph had dreams about his brothers and parents bowing to him. That was exciting, but for those dreams to come to pass, he had to be sold into slavery, be lied against, and be thrown in prison. Nonetheless, he remained steadfast, believing that one day, what God showed him will come to pass – and it did come to pass.<br>Beloved, if God has called you to an assignment and has made some promises to you, and yet things are not looking like what He has said, you are in good company. Everyone who ever received a call from God also went through this, but only those who were tenacious enough to stay the course succeeded.<br>When God called me to full-time ministry, one of the promises He made to me was that I will lead a mighty endtime army for Him. At that time, the church was very small. I thought He will grow the church quickly to build that army, but we would increase by two members in one week and reduce by four the next week. I held seminars, fasted, prayed, and did everything I knew to do but the church did not grow. I had left my well-paying job to answer God's call, so I became a laughing stock to my friends at the university because they thought I was crazy to have made that decision. Nothing seemed to be working, but I kept at it. I did not compromise on my faith and I did not stop trusting God. Today, The Redeemed Christian Church of God is in over 190 nations of the world and we can indeed say that it is a mighty end-time army.<br>Like Joseph, don't compromise in times of trials; keep pressing on and you will see God’s promises come to pass.",

That is not the assignment that Jesus gave to us when He was leaving the earth; He said we are to take the gospel from Jerusalem (your immediate environment) to Judea, to Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the world (Acts 1:8). God is interested in the multiplication of your impact around the world. Don't stop until you win the whole world for Christ.<br>Isaac didn't just grow to become great, the Bible says he kept on moving forward (Genesis 26:12-13). Apostle Paul said He was constantly pressing on; in Philippians 3:13- 14, he said:<br><strong><em>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</em></strong><br>If I had listened to people who said that I had 'arrived' many years ago, the impact that RCCG has made today would never have happened. I tell such people, “Thank you, I haven't even started yet.” I remember over 30 years ago when someone came into my office during a period when I was fasting for 40 days. He saw me lying there, weak because I had not eaten for weeks and he said, “What else are you looking for that you stress yourself so much? Your auditorium is the biggest in Africa, what else do you want?” Imagine if I had listened to such, maybe you would never have heard of Adeboye today.<br>You are not only to multiply in the impact you make in the world, but you are also to multiply in your knowledge of the One who sent you. The strength with which you got to where you are today is not enough to take you to the next level.<br>Jesus Christ gave an open invitation to anyone who thirsted to come unto Him and drink from Him. He went further to say that if such a fellow also believes on Him, rivers of living water will flow out of his or her belly (John 7:37-38). You need to keep drinking from Him if you want to keep multiplying. The deeper you go in God, the more He can commit to you.",

The opposite is the case, however, because 1 Corinthians 1:27 says that God calls the weak, the foolish, and those that are nought. When God calls you for an assignment, you must be extremely grateful to Him for the privilege of being called and for every single achievement as you walk in your calling because, without Him, you can do nothing (John 15:5).<br>As I mentioned earlier in this series, I studied people who were called before me and who succeeded in their callings. One of them was Apostle Paul; He was an academic like me before he was called by God. I noticed that Paul was always grateful to God. He wrote in 1 Thessalonians 5:18:<br><strong><em>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</em></strong><br>In our Bible reading today, we see how grateful Mary was for being chosen to give birth to our Saviour Jesus Christ and she succeeded in her calling. If you really want to succeed in your calling, then you must be grateful to God always. I don't know about you, but I can never forget how good God has been to me.<br>We had just finished a service in a foreign country one day and God really moved in that service, many souls got saved and there were all kinds of miracles. On my way back to the hotel, I discussed the great things that happened in the service with those that were with me. When we arrived, the fellow sitting in the front seat of the car opened the door to get down and as he slammed the door shut, my finger got caught in the door frame. Up until today, I have no idea of how my finger got caught in the doorframe. I cried out in pain and everyone rallied around me saying, “Sorry”. As I went upstairs, I asked God, “Lord, why did you let this happen to me?” He said, “You were talking about all the great things I did in the service and you didn't even turn to Me to say, 'Thank you Lord.'” I realised my error, apologised and thanked Him. By the time I got to my room, the pain had completely disappeared.<br>God is watching to see if you will be grateful or not. He will warn you once or twice if you are ungrateful. If you refuse to heed His warnings, He will withdraw His support and that will be dangerous.",

When God calls you for an assignment, He will support you all the way so that you can succeed despite the forces that try to stop you. However, Romans 8:31 says, “If God be for you, who can be against you?” The answer is, 'You!' If God is for you, yet you cannot control your body not to work against you, then you may not fulfil His call.<br>Not only must you stay away from sin, you must also do everything in moderation. You cannot afford to sleep anytime you like, eat as you wish, or be intimate with your spouse as many times as you want.

Paul said that he kept his body under, in other words, I tell my stomach when it is going to eat next and my eyes when they are going to sleep next. People have asked me how I fast for 40 days and nights, and I say, “Simple. The night before I start, I go to an almanac, count 40 days, and mark when the fasting is to end. Then I say to my stomach, 'That date is the next time you will get food.'” The stomach will grumble because it doesn't like that kind of situation. When you drive along the street, every restaurant on the route will seem to be calling you, and you will smell the food in another house from almost a quarter kilometre away.

      "Many ministers of God talk about prayers and lead prayers often, but hardly pray. When it is time for prayers, they announce the prayer point, ask people to pray, and all they do throughout is encourage the people to keep praying; they don't pray in prayer meetings or in private. This is one of the reasons many don't fulfil the call of God on their lives.<br>Apostle Paul was a man of prayer. In 1 Thessalonians 5:17, he said, “Pray without ceasing.” When I want to leave my house on a journey, I pray. When I get into the car, I pray again. When I get on the airplane, I pray again. The Bible says pray without ceasing – keep praying. A songwriter said:<br><strong><em>Christian, seek not yet repose,</em></strong><strong><em>Hear thy gracious saviour say;</em></strong><strong><em>Thou art in the midst of foes: Watch and pray..</em></strong><br>Around 1985, I had tried everything I knew, but the church wasn't growing as I expected. Then, I heard about a pastor in South Korea whose church was growing rapidly, and who usually held a yearly Ministers' Conference. I didn't have the money to go, but I prayed and God sent help. I went and I saw what I had never seen before. I heard the pastor saying on the pulpit that those who had come that Sunday should not come the next Sunday because of space, this was despite holding seven services every Sunday in a hall that could take 50,000 people. During the conference, they took us to his prayer mountain where we were assigned to grottos where we could pray privately. I lost track of time while praying in my grotto and by the time I finished, those who came on the same bus with me had been waiting for me for at least one hour. When I got into the bus, they were angry and asked, “Why have you delayed us?” I said, “I'm sorry, I thought we came to pray.” They said, “Are you going to pray everything in one day?” Nobody spoke to me all the way back and that was fine because, in my heart, I was still roaring in prayer. Some years ago, I went back to South Korea. The first time I went, I couldn't get close to the man of God, but this time, I was able to meet him – Dr Yonggi Cho of blessed memory. He said, “I have heard about you, will you please pray for me?”<br>Beloved, I encourage you to pray always (Ephesians 6:18).",

Stretch your hands across the sea.” If Moses had refused to stretch his hands that day, the book of Exodus might have ended there, Israel might have been wiped out, and God probably might have had to find an alternative way for Jesus to be born. I pray that when God needs someone He can rely on in times of crises, you will be available.<br>Years ago, when we were starting the church in Zambia, I visited the country for the first time. While discussing with my host, we got talking about a man they called Cobra. He was a really terrible and dangerous person. As we spoke, I heard God say that he must be saved. I told my host that I wanted to go and preach to Cobra and asked him to take me to his house. He told me that I was not likely to come out alive. I insisted, and at last, he agreed to take me within a walking distance to Cobra's house, wait for 15 minutes after I enter, and leave if I didn't come out in that time. I said, “No problem.” God wanted me to partner with Him to win that soul, and I knew I had to go. I went in to meet Cobra and within 15 minutes, he was on his knees in surrender to Christ!<br>God needs partners to do His will on earth, but those who will partner with Him must be willing to go all the way for Him. When you hear God say, “I have found a man who will do all My will,” it means that He has been searching for someone to do all His will. Can God count on you to partner with Him and do all His will?",

      "But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.",
    bodyText:
      "For everyone who becomes great, there is always at least one person God provides to be his or her 'right-hand man'. For example, in Exodus 4:10-16, when Moses told God that he could not go to Egypt because he couldn't speak well, God appointed Aaron to assist him. In Exodus 17:8-13, when the Amalekites came to attack Israel, Moses went to the mountaintop with Aaron and Hur and told Joshua to lead the army in the valley below. Moses lifted up his hands and Israel prevailed, but when his hands got tired, Aaron and Hur gave him a rock to sit on and held up his hands. In the meantime, Joshua was in the valley below fighting. All these people were right-hand men to Moses. <br>We find another example in Genesis 24. Abraham called his lead servant and asked him to get a wife for His son amongst his (Abraham's) people. That lead servant was Abraham's right-hand man in this case. I should, however, also note that the term is genderless, as a woman can also be a 'right-hand man' to another woman. The right-hand man is someone who is close enough to his or her leader to know what the latter needs at every moment, and be proactive in providing it. <br>You should also identify your right-hand man if you haven't. Your right-hand man can say what you cannot say yourself or might have a way of presenting the matter that will effectively pass on your intended message. He or she can be the lifter of your hands, the one who will help you when your hands go weary. Such a person is the one who can provide you with something to sit upon when you are tired; someone who can make you comfortable even at his or her own discomfort. Like Joshua, he or she is the one who can fight your battles even when you are not there. <br>Your real right-hand man is one who, despite your closeness, will never take you for granted because of familiarity. Your right-hand man is one who will see your weaknesses and not use them against you or go around telling others about them; he or she will rather cover them as Aaron and Hur did for Moses. Your right-hand man is one to whom you can entrust things and be sure that they will do it as you want it done. Note that God may have you serve as a right-hand man to someone as well.",

Whether God gives you a right-hand man or you are someone's right-hand man, when you do your assignment as God intends it, He rewards you greatly.<br>I had such a man in the late Pa Abiona, popularly known as Papa DGO (Deputy General Overseer). When I became General Overseer as a young fellow, I had been in the church for only seven years, and there were people who had been there from the very beginning. Some of these people were determined that I would fail, and there was nothing I said that they did not criticise. Papa DGO, however, had my back all the time. He was old enough to be my father, but he always stood by me. He fought my battles and always ensured my instructions were carried out to the letter, regardless of the complaints from those opposing me. In those early days, there was one town in particular where the brethren often quarrelled amongst themselves. Once I was informed that they were at it again and I mention it to Papa, he wouldn't even let me finish before he would say, “I will go and deal with them.” He is in heaven now wearing his crown of many stars because he was a good right-hand man. <br>In Exodus 24:12-15, when God summoned Moses to come into a cloud, only Joshua went with him. When Moses was leaving the world, Joshua, not one of the elders or the leader of any of the tribes in Israel, but someone you could call Moses' errand boy, was the one God chose to continue the work and lead the children of Israel to the promised land. <br>In 1 Samuel 3:1-9, God called Samuel one night, but he thought it was Eli who was calling him. In the middle of the night when Samuel was supposed to be sleeping, he kept running to answer Eli because he felt Eli needed him – that is a good right-hand man. In return, God gave him the ability to become a kingmaker and a king-remover. <br>Beloved, if the Lord has assigned you to be a right-hand man to someone, consider it a privilege. Ensure you serve to the best of your capacity, and you can rest assured that God will reward you tremendously.",

      "When David was in the cave of Adullam, he had some right-hand men that were called the 'mighty men of David'. In 2 Samuel 23:16, they risked their lives to get him the water he had a longing to drink. Though they were vagabonds when David met them, they became valiant men under him, and he gave them high ranks in his army. Ahithophel was also David's right-hand man, and Psalm 41:9 tells us that he sat at David's table. When God gives you right-hand men, they must be honoured and never looked down on. Joseph was Pharaoh's right-hand man. When Joseph brought his people to Egypt, Pharaoh gave them Goshen, the best part of the land, to dwell in. Great men know that to be successful, they must honour and take care of their right-hand men. <br>You must show your right-hand men that you are just as committed to them as they are committed to you. Not long ago, a friend of mine called very late in the night and said, “Daddy, I have a problem.” He told me the problem, and we ended the call. Soon after, I called my driver, and we left the house. About an hour later when I called him, he thought it was to tell him that I was still praying, but what he heard was, “Please tell them to let me in at the gate.” He was surprised to see me, but I told him, “What are friends for?” Any time of the day that I needed him, he always ran to me. Now that he needed me, I also ran to him. <br>If people show commitment to you, you must also show commitment to them. Many people have lost their right-hand men because they refused to honour them. Whenever it is possible, I usually rearrange my schedule so I can be at the birthday celebrations of some of the people God has placed as my right-hand men. You may not know it, but that fellow who has been very committed to you might have been mocked at one time or the other because of it. There might have been times when you unknowingly did something that offended the fellow, and he or she endured it because of his or her commitment to helping you achieve your vision. In return, whenever you have the opportunity, you must also show your commitment to your right-hand men. That will really go a long way in encouraging them",

      "Our God is a master planner, He is always many steps ahead in His planning. In our Bible reading today, Joseph's brothers planned to do evil to him, but they did not know that God had gone ahead to use their evil plot as a means to fulfil his destiny. What a master plan! We see another example in the book of Esther where God had already made Esther the queen before Mordecai began to plot evil against the Israelites. Many times, when we think that some things are happening for no specific reason, we have no idea that God is setting one of His plans in motion. <br>In 1 Samuel 17, the Bible tells us of a big giant that was terrorising the army of a nation on the battlefield for 40 days. Back in the country, nobody knew about the terrorist, but a man sent his young son to take food to his older brothers that were on the battlefield. That young son happened to be David, the man that God had anointed to be the next king of Israel. Before this, God had arranged for David to be trained to kill giants by sending a lion and a bear for him to kill as practice. When you read the story, you will hear David telling the king about the training he had received in the forest which qualified him to face the giant and kill him. <br>Acts 16:9-40 tells us about another clever plan of God. God wanted to save the soul of a man and his family, but because of the nature of that man's work, there was no way he could attend any crusade. As a jailer, he couldn't leave the prison he was working in as he had to look after the prisoners. Therefore, God needed somebody to go to the prison to preach to him. In that story, you will see clearly how God planned it; in a vision, somebody told Paul, “Come to Macedonia and help us.” Paul went to Macedonia in line with the vision, cast a demon out of a girl, and ended up in jail because of a family that had to be saved. <br>Trust God and obey whatever instructions He gives to you. Once He tells you to go in a particular direction, obey Him so that you can be a vessel that He uses to bring His plans to pass",

      "Many times, when we go to Christian gatherings and the message or sermon being preached starts to sound a bit hard to swallow, there's always a tendency for us to feel that God is talking to our neighbour and not to us. I believe you must have felt like that before. Once in a while, as the preacher is preaching and condemning certain things that make us a bit uncomfortable, we console ourselves by saying, “He can't be talking to me. He must be talking to my neighbour.” Don't deceive yourself when the word hits you; God is talking to you and not someone else. Every time you hear the word of God, don't go pointing fingers. Look within yourself, and wherever you see that you are not living up to His standard, make adjustments immediately. <br>In the Bible reading for today, a prophet came to King David and told him the story of a rich man who robbed a poor man of the only lamb he had. The rich man killed the lamb and used it to entertain his visitors instead of taking one out of the many that he had. David went into a rage and said, “That man shall surely die.” Then, the prophet turned to him and said, “Thou art the man”. Many times, God brings messages like that to us, and just like David, we start to condemn others, but, if we take a moment to reflect on the message, we just might be the ones being described. <br>The way to grow as a Christian is not to assume that certain messages or scriptural verses are meant for other people and not you. Listen or read as if you are the one God is talking to directly. Face the fact that you might not be doing some things right and ensure that you do what must be done to make things right if that is the case. <br>The reason we have many so-called Christians who don't behave like Christ is not because God does not correct them; it is because when He corrects them, they assume He is correcting other people. Unfortunately, if they keep doing that, they will get to a point where they could be destroyed. Beloved, God is speaking to you today. He wants you to surrender all to Him completely without holding anything back. Don't be like those who harden their necks because the end of such people is destruction (Proverbs 29:1).",

      "In our Bible reading for today, the Bible says that the first reason the Spirit of the Lord is upon you is to preach good tidings. <br>Acts 1:8 says: <strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</strong> <br>God says, “You will not only be a witness to me in the comfort of your home or local assembly; you must also go from Jerusalem to Judea, then to Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the world.” The anointing is not only for your domestic use; it is also to be used in the uttermost parts of the world for preaching the gospel. This is why I am amazed when I see preachers who do not go out of their comfort zones to preach the gospel – preachers who just stay in their local assemblies where they are comfortable and preach from there. They ignore the rest of the world and act as if it is not their business if people go to hell. <br>When you become anointed, your first assignment is to begin to preach the gospel to those that are around you and then progress until you get to the uttermost parts of the world. When you start going out to preach, you will see how many people around the world still don't know about Christ. If you take a walk around Redemption City in Nigeria, there are several banners that show pictures and names of countries where Christianity has hardly gotten to. This is to remind us that we are not called to remain in our comfort zones, but we are to go out and win souls for our Lord.<br>I am 82 years old, and even at my age, I have not stopped going everywhere I can to preach the gospel because I know that it is the very first reason that God anointed me. I have been to countries that most people in the world don't even know exist! The reason we see many young ministers rise and fall is that after they receive the anointing, they choose to stay in their comfort zones. <br>Beloved, the harvest is plenty, but labourers are few. Will you make yourself available? Go out and work for your Father, especially when you are still young.",

      "Many people see the anointed and envy them; they also want to be able to lay hands on the sick and have them recover. The anointing to heal the sick is, however, available to every believer. Mark 16:17- 18 says that if you are a believer, some signs will follow you, and this includes healing the sick. When you, however, study Matthew 8:14-18, you will see that the moment you have the healing gift, crowds will come. Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law, and then, in the evening, they brought all those who were sick and demon-possessed. The news spread so much that many people came to Him for healing. <br>If you want to be able to lay hands on the sick for their healing, you must be ready for hard work – you will preach, heal, and comfort the brokenhearted. If anyone is in any form of trouble, they will call on you. You will also have to set the captives free, so demon-possessed people will be paying you constant visits, and according to Ephesians 6:12, casting out demons involves spiritual wrestling. Spiritual wrestling is not for the lazy, so if you want to be anointed, you cannot afford to be lazy. The Lord Jesus had the anointing (Acts 10:38), but in Mark 6:31, He had to tell the disciples, “Let us take a break,” because He became so busy that there wasn't enough time to even eat. If you really want to be anointed, you must be ready to work. I am not saying this to frighten you, I am saying it to get you prepared because someone reading this devotional now is going to get powerfully anointed soon, in Jesus' name. <br>Many years ago, I read 1 Corinthians 12:31 which says: <strong><em>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. </em></strong><br>I realised God approves for His children to be covetous of the best spiritual gifts, so I told God, “Lord, I want double the anointing on Elisha, Paul, Peter, and Jesus when He was on earth. Add everything together and then double it again.” God responded, “You are asking for a dangerous thing; people won't let you rest.” I said, “I don't mind.” How forward we can be sometimes. I now have a better understanding of His warning. If you really desire to be anointed, pray the prayer point for today with all your heart.",

      "In 1 Kings 19:19, as Elijah was passing by Elisha, he cast his mantle upon him, and from that day, Elisha's life never remained the same. Anything that the Holy Spirit has touched has been touched by fire, and when fire touches something, it changes permanently. <br>Exodus 3:1-5 tells us that the fire of God touched the ground of that backside of the desert, and from that moment onward, God called it holy ground. When Moses got there, God told him to take off his shoes because the ordinary soil He had touched had become holy ground. <br>Exodus 4:1-20 tells us how holy the ground was, because everything that touched that ground also changed permanently, such that in verse 20, the Bible says: <strong><em>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</em></strong> <br>After the encounter with the fire of God, Moses left for Egypt, and amongst all the things he took, he took the rod of God. The ordinary rod of a shepherd had now become the rod of God because it touched the holy ground. <br>Some years ago, a woman fell so ill that the doctors said that there was nothing they could do to help her. Her children were advised to take her home so she could die with her family around her. The woman told her children, “Don't take me home; take me to the Redeemed Christian Church of God headquarters.” They told her, “Mama, but there is no service today. The pastor will not be there.” She said, “I didn't say I want to go and see the pastor; just take me there.” They took her to the church, but because she was very weak, she could not walk by herself, so she asked them to help her reach one of the pillars of the building. The moment she got to the pillar and touched it, she became completely healed, and she walked back to the car herself. She experienced a brush with the fire of God through her faith, and she became healed. <br>There is tremendous power in anything that has touched holy ground. Don't just go for services casually, be conscious that you are going to a place of fire. When you go to your local assembly, go with expectations, and you will experience great miracles in your life.",

      "When you are in a service, and everyone is praying that fire should fall, you must beware, because when the fire of God falls, some people die, and some others rejoice. When the fire of God falls, those who do not belong to Him are consumed, while those who belong to Him are empowered. <br>In Daniel 3:19-30, when they threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the fire, their yokes were destroyed by the fire, they walked out of the fire into promotion, but those who were not on the side of the Lord that got close to that fire were consumed. <br>Some years ago, as I was preaching during a service, the fire of God fell. While people were getting their healing, a woman ran out of the service. From outside the hall, she beckoned on the fellow she came with to bring her bag so that she could go home. Surprised, the fellow asked her why she couldn't come in to get her bag herself, and she said that there was fire in the place and she couldn't come in for fear of being burnt. When the fire of God comes down, while it brings healing and promotions to God's children, it can destroy those who are not on the Lord's side. So, before you join those who are asking for fire to fall, if you are not already on God's side, please cross over. <br>I should also note that sometimes, the fire of God comes down unexpectedly in the middle of a service. Even the preacher may be unaware that God is about to rain down fire. When the fire falls, only those who are on Christ's side will be safe. The reason I chose the passage in our Bible reading for today is that I want to speak particularly to those who are workers in the church and who are still dipping their hands into sin. Surrender your life completely to the Lord Jesus Christ because if you are standing by when the fire begins to fall, and you are not on the Lord's side, the result might not be very pleasant. <br>God usually gives room for repentance, but that is until His fire falls. The day the fire falls is the day of consequences – there is no repentance after that. Many are nursing diseases and other terrible issues because when the fire of God fell, they were not on His side.",

      "When you see a man of God laying hands on people, and they get healed, it is because those hands have been in contact with the fire of God. Ordinary hands become anointed once they come in contact with the fire of God. <br>In Exodus 3, when Moses threw his rod on the holy ground, it became a serpent, and the Lord asked him to pick the serpent up by the tail. As Moses bent to pick up the serpent, his own hands also brushed the ground that the fire had touched. From that day on, his hands became special. In Exodus 17:8-13, we see those hands deciding the outcome of a war between Israel and the Amalekites. Every time he lifted his hands, Israel won, but when his hands got heavy and were going down, the Amalekites began to win. Aaron and Hur were with him, they had four hands combined, but they knew that Moses' hands, which had touched the holy ground, were different from ordinary hands. So, rather than lift their own hands, they helped Moses keep his hands up. In Exodus 14:16, God said to Moses: <br><strong><em>But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</em></strong><br>God had anointed Moses' hands, so He ordered him to stretch them over the Red Sea to divide it. So, in Exodus 14:21, when Moses stretched out his hands over the sea, it had no choice but to part into two. In Deuteronomy 34:9, those hands also transmitted wisdom into Joshua.<br><strong><em><span class=\"ql-cursor\">﻿</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. </em></strong><br>The power of God turns the ordinary into extraordinary. If you read John 9:1-7, where Jesus saw a man who was born blind, He spat on the ground, made some mud out of it and anointed the blind man's eyes. Ordinary mud can become anointed mud; it all depends on whose hands the mud is in. Your hands can also become anointed today, but first, they must be holy hands. Psalm 24:3-4 says that only those who have holy hands can ascend into the hill of the Lord where they can come in contact with the fire of God.",

Because the fire came on him, he took the jawbone of an ass, and it became a weapon of mass destruction in his hands. <br>When you are anointed, everything you touch comes into contact with the anointing. Mark 5:25-29 tells us of healing through the Lord's garment. Acts 5:14-16 tells us that even Peter's shadow was healing the sick. Acts 19:11-12 tells us that Paul's handkerchiefs and aprons were healing the sick. <br>You need the fire of God, and you can get it today. God's fire is available because, in Matthew 3:11, the promise is that Jesus Christ will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. If you get the fire of God, your life will be transformed for good. With the fire of God on you, you can heal incurable diseases and win souls to the kingdom more easily than ever before. <br>You don't only need the fire of God to heal the sick, you also need it against the enemy. Judges 14:5-6 tells us that Samson was going to Timnath when, all of a sudden, a lion roared at him. The fire of God came on him, and he tore the lion to pieces. You need the fire in case the enemy roars, then you can tell him, “I am more than ready for you.” As you grow in the Lord, there is bound to be resistance from the enemy, and you will need the fire of God to uproot obstacles to the work of the Lord. <br>John 4:48 says that some people will not believe the word of God unless they see signs and wonders. These signs and wonders can only happen when you have been baptised with the fire of God. I have been privileged to win many great and influential people to Christ because of the mighty miracles they saw God performing through me. <br>I am going to ask you to cry to God to be baptised with the heavenly fire today so that your life will be filled with signs and wonders. Working for God and bearing abiding fruits for the kingdom will become even easier.",

      "My Father in the Lord came to visit me in my little house in Ilesha in 1975. We prayed that night, and everyone went to bed – at least that was what I thought. When I went to the toilet at the backyard before I slept around 10pm, I saw my Father in the Lord praying. Around 5am, I went to the toilet again, and he was still on his knees praying. Later that morning, I asked him if there was any problem as I thought praying overnight meant there was a serious problem at hand. He smiled and said, “There is no problem. Don't worry; you will understand soon.” I was shocked to know that there was no problem, yet he prayed all night. I also knew that God had told me to emulate Him. <br>One pastor came to me years ago and said, “When we started this journey together, we were on the same level. Now you are far ahead of us. Tell us the secret.” I said, “There is nothing I am doing that you don't know; I fast, pray and keep vigils. If you want to be as I am, do the same.” Another man of God from another ministry was praying, “God, give me ten per cent of what you gave Pastor Adeboye; I will be satisfied.” God told him, “Do what Pastor Adeboye is doing, and I will give you what I gave him.” He asked God, “What is he doing?” God said, “He started with 40 days of fasting and prayers.” He said, “God, I think I am okay the way I am.” Only those that are willing to make sacrifices will be great. You cannot be great by loading your body with food and your mind with entertainment – those things only give surface and temporary benefits. Someone with financial issues can watch a funny movie and laugh, such that people will call him a happy man, but after the movie is over, he will go back to face his problems. The benefits of a life without sacrifice are temporary. Don't be deceived by temporary pleasures; pay the price to fulfil your destiny and achieve greatness. <br>The taller a building will be, the deeper its builders must dig before laying its foundation. The things that will take you very high in life are mostly things done in private. The way you pray, fast, study, work, etc., in private will determine how great you will become.",

The second reason was to give them final instructions before leaving the earth. What instruction was so important that He had to give them before leaving? That instruction is in Mark 16:15-18. <br>Now that He had paid the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus said, “Go and tell everyone around the world that they don't have to perish in hell. If they can just believe in Me, they will have power over sicknesses, demons, and poisons, and also end up in heaven rather than hell.” This is the instruction He gave to His disciples before He left. Are you one of His disciples? If your answer is 'Yes', have you been obeying this instruction? <br><strong><em>Have you been preaching the gospel to sinners?

A man had a dream where he saw an angel coming from hell with a letter for him. The angel said, “This letter is from somebody who said he knows you.” The fellow was his friend. In the letter, he wrote, “I am here because you didn't tell me about the dangers of this place. In all the years we were together, you did not tell me I was heading for danger.” The man woke up, and as soon as it was daybreak, he went to his friend's house to preach the gospel to him. When he knocked on the door, a fellow came to open it and said, “You have heard?” He responded, “Heard what?” The fellow replied, “Your friend passed away in the night.” This man could have saved his friend from eternal damnation.

      "The more we are in our local assemblies, the merrier our services will be. If we are not many, how can we make a joyful noise? The more we are, the louder the noise we can make, and the merrier it will be to praise God together. Let me tell you what I believe to be the origin of clapping. One day, the fingers woke up and heard the birds singing, and they said, “O God, we also want to praise You.” They tried to make a sound individually, but no sound came. Suddenly, they said, “If two of us should cooperate, maybe we can produce some sound.” So, one finger cooperated with another finger, and they discovered that there was a little snapping sound. They took it further, and one finger cooperated with the other palm. They made a better sound, and then another finger decided to join in. The sound improved, and yet another finger joined in. Before long, all the fingers were jamming together in praise, making a joyful noise to the Lord. <br>In the same token, the more we are, the greater our impact will be in the world. When we are many, the impact we will make cannot be ignored because it will be significant. When ten people come together against a policy of the government, the government can easily ignore them. However, when 10,000 people come together to speak against the same policy, it will be very difficult for the government to ignore them. The governing powers in the environment where your local assembly is situated will take you more seriously when you are many. As a result, your local assembly can influence the culture and policies in that environment. <br>When we are many, projects become easier to accomplish. When ten people come together to do something, they will have to put in a lot of effort and personal resources to get it done. However, if 100 people come together to do the same thing, they obviously will need less individual effort and personal resources to get that thing done. Therefore, projects are done faster and easier when we are many. <br>Beloved, if truly God is your father, you should be committed to the expansion of His kingdom. Preach the gospel anywhere you find yourself and set a personal target to win at least one soul to Christ per day. If you cannot go to the mission field, support missionaries with your prayers and your personal resources. The more Christians we have around the world, the greater our impact will be.",

      "The twenty-four elders in heaven made it clear in today's memory verse that we were created to fulfil God's pleasure. When we live for ourselves alone, we negate the purpose of our existence. When a person lives for God, he or she would not abuse any privilege or opportunity. <br>Joseph is a good example of someone who lived for God and his fellow human beings, particularly his brothers. Even though they eventually repaid him with evil, his selfless service made him go the extra mile to find them and deliver their food to them when he couldn't locate them initially. He could have returned home with the supplies he took with him, but he didn't. You can find the story in Genesis 37:13-28. Joseph's love for God caused him to reject the sexual advances of his master's wife. He could not bear doing anything that will displease God, and this made him say in Genesis 39:9: <br><strong><em>There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</em></strong> <br>Furthermore, his love for people made him interpret the dreams of his fellow inmates, which led to him becoming the Prime Minister of Egypt. When he eventually came into power, he did not consider the hardships he endured due to the cruelty of his brothers when they sold him into slavery. The love of God in him made him realise that his sufferings served a higher purpose for God and humanity. He said in Genesis 50:20: <br><strong><em>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. </em></strong><br>Our Father in heaven wants us to live a selfless life so that we can attain the fullness of His purpose for our lives. Those who are selfish short-change themselves without knowing it. <br>Moses, even though he lived in affluence in Pharoah's palace, decided to suffer with his brethren (the Israelites) and eventually saved them from bondage by leading them out of Egypt (Hebrews 11:24-27). His selflessness ensured that he fulfilled God's purpose for his life and the nation of Israel at large.

      "Knowing fully well that there is a time to be born and a time to die, we ought to be thankful to God for each day that He gives us life. I, however, have a question I will like you to answer sincerely - what will people remember you for after you've left the earth? Another question which I consider even more important than the initial one is, when your time is up on earth, what account will you give to God of how you spent your life? Hebrews 9:27 says: <br><strong><em>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: </em></strong><br>In other words, death is not the end of our existence, but rather a transition to another state. One way our lives carry on after death is through the things we are remembered for. There are those whose remembrance brings gladness and joy, while the remembrance of some others brings bitterness and sorrowful memories. <br>One woman who was remembered for good after she died was Dorcas. She was one of the early believers in our Lord, and she lived a good life of service and righteousness. This is the testimony of her life as written in Acts 9:36:<br> <strong><em>…this woman was full of good works and alms deeds which she did. </em></strong><br>A lesson here for us is that our good works play a great role in showing our faith and commitment to God. Speaking on this, James 2:15-17 says: <br><strong><em>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. </em></strong><br>The gospel of Jesus must find practical expression in your life through your good works; the testimony of the brethren concerning Dorcas confirms this. She was so full of good works that the church found it difficult to accept her demise, and so, she was brought back to life. Psalm 112:5-6 says: <br><strong><em>A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</em></strong> <br>Beloved, what good deeds will people remember you for? Think about this and remember the words of today's memory verse.",

      "Today's topic is actually the prayer of people who feel that they don't know God enough and want to know Him more. <br>Daniel 11:32 says that those who know their God shall be strong and do exploits. To know God the way He ought to be known is very beneficial. If you know Him as He should be known, you will gladly surrender your life completely to Him. You will gladly surrender your future to Him because you will suddenly say, “What am I anyway, that did not originate in God? Who am I anyway, if God didn't make me who I am? What can ever happen in my future that He doesn't know already?” Total surrender only becomes possible when you truly know Him. You can only go wherever He asks you to if you know Him as you should. <br>A young married couple came to Africa for a missionary trip on their honeymoon. While walking around, they came across a really huge fence with gates. They found the gateman and asked, “Who are the people behind these walls?” The gateman answered, “Lepers,” and the couple asked another question, “Has anyone preached the gospel to them?” The gateman said, “Anyone who goes in there doesn't come out. We throw food to them over the gate.” The couple insisted that they needed to go in to preach to them. The gateman reiterated that anyone who goes in never comes out. The husband looked at his wife, and she said, “What the Lord said is ‘go’. He didn't say anything about coming back.” That was one couple that really knew God! <br>You can't know God through preaching, you can only know Him if He reveals Himself to you. I never went to any Bible college. Even though I learnt a lot from my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi and Pa S.G Elton, God had to reveal Himself to me. Only God can reveal Himself to you, and this was why Jesus said to Peter, “Flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven” (Matthew 16:17). The first time I heard people praying, “Oh God of Adeboye, come and do this for me,” I was shocked, and I asked myself, “Who is Adeboye?” However, somebody must have thought to himself, “We may not know God so well, but there is somebody who knows Him.” I pray that you will know Him the way He ought to be known, in Jesus' name.",

      "When Apostle Paul said that he wanted to know the power of His resurrection in Philippians 3:10, he was saying that he wanted to know the power that raised Jesus from the dead. There is a power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. That power, according to Romans 8:11, is the power of the Holy Spirit, the power that can quicken your mortal body. That power is still available to the children of God even after Jesus Christ died, rose, and went to heaven. <br>It is a great thing to be baptised in the Holy Spirit. However, there is an experience and encounter that goes far beyond being baptised in the Holy Spirit. When you are baptised in the Holy Spirit, you speak in tongues, but speaking in tongues is not enough; you need to be baptised by fire too. Speaking in tongues is wonderful, and I encourage it, but you can't go to some nations, get into their marketplaces, and start speaking in tongues and think you will win souls for Christ; you might lose your head or spend the rest of your life in prison! You need the fire of the Holy Ghost. <br>Whether you believe it or not, every force that is in heaven, on earth, or underneath the earth, is subject to that power that raised Jesus from the dead. This is why the world fears Pentecostalism. If there was one dead fellow that the devil did not want to rise, it was Jesus Christ, because he knew that if Jesus rose from the dead, he was finished. However, that power that raised Jesus from the dead was so powerful that with all the things that the devil tried in Matthew 27:62-66, Jesus still rose from the dead. He is higher than all principalities and powers, and His rising from the dead opened the door for you and me to also be higher than them. Ephesians 2:6 says: <br><strong><em>And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: </em></strong><br>The scripture above shows clearly that believers in Jesus Christ are now seated with Him in heavenly places. Once you know that power that raised Jesus from the dead, no witch, wizard, demon, or principality will be able to overcome you. You will begin to command demons, and they will obey speedily. If you want to know that power, pray today's prayer point with all your heart.",

      "Over the past two days, I have been discussing some lessons from Philippians 3:10, and today, I will be going even deeper. Apostle Paul said clearly that he wanted to know the fellowship of Jesus' sufferings; in other words, he wanted to partake in the sufferings of Jesus Christ. Ordinary Christians don't pray this kind of prayer; the prayer of the ordinary Christian usually sounds as follows, “God heal me, set me free, give me a car, prosper me, promote me, make me fruitful.” You won't hear an ordinary Christian praying, “God, let me suffer for you.” I pray for you that you will leave the company of the ordinary today and enter into the company of the extraordinary, in Jesus' name. Paul was a great example of an extraordinary Christian. He was eager to know God and to suffer for the gospel of Jesus Christ. <br>Romans 8:16-17 says: <br><strong><em>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint\u0002heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. </em></strong><br>It is when we suffer with Jesus that we can be glorified with Him. Paul said, “Let no man trouble me, I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ” (Galatians 6:17). In other words, he was saying, “I have scars to show that I suffered with Him.” <br>God glorifies those who are partakers of the sufferings of Christ. It's just like a responsible man whose wife suffered with him during tough times. When things get better, there will be nothing money can afford that he will not buy for her. One of the reasons I value my wife greatly today is that when I resigned from lecturing and moved into the middle of nowhere, telling everyone that it is a city that God promised me, she moved in with me. It was tough, but she backed me all the way and partook in my suffering. Now that things are better, she is partaking in the glory. <br>Are you seeking for opportunities to experience the fellowship of Jesus' suffering? Have you suffered with Him in any way? Congratulations if you said, 'Yes' genuinely to these questions because when it is time to be glorified, you will be glorified with Jesus. If you, however, are among those denying Him, remember that He said that He will also deny such persons before His Father in Heaven (Matthew 10:33).",

      "The story I shared yesterday reminds me of three Ugandan boys I met at the Christian programme in Kenya. Those boys were probably hungrier for God than any of us at that programme. During break times, while everyone was buying sandwiches, those three boys would sit together, singing praises to God. I asked why they never ate when everyone else ate, and they responded that food was not their concern. Firstly, they had no money to buy food. Secondly, they said they were praying to return safely and not get arrested or even executed by the then-Ugandan military ruler upon their return. For three days, they had eaten nothing and were just glad to be there. For the rest of our stay, whatever little I had, I shared with them. I told them to write to me when they got back home safely, and they did to the glory of God. <br>Your hunger for God should be such that you won't even remember to eat when it is time to seek Him. You should be so hungry for God that you are willing to risk your life just to know Him more. I get amazed anytime we call a fast, and some people grumble. They are not hungry for God enough to fast for just a few days in the year to draw closer to Him. <br>In the 1970s, I used to gather some RCCG youths in a place called 'Youth Camp'. Accommodation and feeding were usually included in our payment for the venue, but people rarely cared to eat after the sessions. I usually had to beg them to eat so we would not waste the food. They didn't care much for food, they only wanted the word of God. Jeremiah 15:16 says: <br><strong><em>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts. </em></strong><br>What exactly are the things you are hungry for? Food? Fame? Money? Put them all aside and let your hunger and thirst every day be for God. Matthew 6:33 says: <br><strong><em>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</em></strong><br> Beloved, please get your priorities right. David, in our Bible reading today, said that his soul will follow hard after God. Can you say the same for yourself?",

      "There are many people walking around with curses that they do not have to carry. There are families suffering under curses that they no longer have to suffer. Beloved, if you are in such a situation, I bring good news to you. Curses placed by men can be cancelled, and I pray for you today that all curses placed on you are cancelled, in Jesus' name. I<br>n Joshua 6:26, Joshua placed a curse on Jericho and from that moment on, the people of Jericho suffered under the curse. Many prophets came and went, but the people of Jericho continued to suffer in silence under the curse. At last, when Elijah was taken away, they realised that if they didn't do something about the curse, their land would remain barren, and death would be rampant amongst them forever. So, they called on Elisha to help them. In 2 Kings 2:19-22, Elisha said, “Go and bring me salt in a new cruse.” They brought it to him, and he took it in his hands, went to the source of their river, poured in the salt and said, “Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.” From that day, the curse was cancelled. <br>Any curse on your life or family can also be cancelled today if you refuse to continue living under it. All you need is a person with a higher power and anointing to break the curse. If the curse was placed by your biological father, you can go to your spiritual father, and he can cancel the curse. This is because the spiritual controls the physical. Also, if it was placed by a man or woman of God, go to a minister of God who has a greater anointing than that fellow, and he or she can cancel the curse. If the curse was placed by a witch or wizard, an anointed man or woman of God can cancel it because the anointing breaks yokes (Isaiah 10:27). <br>Beloved, you must, however, also note that beyond going to any man or woman of God to cancel curses on your behalf, you must seek God's anointing as well. You must pray, fast, study your Bible, and fellowship with God so much that you begin to carry His glory and power. When you do this, no curse can rest on you. If God is with you like He was with the Israelites in Numbers 24, you will be blessed, and no curse will be able to rest on you.",

      "In our memory verse for today, the Bible says, “I must do the work,” not “I may do the work.” It is neither an option nor a piece of advice. Doing God's work is compulsory for all His children; this simply means that you have no choice in the matter. In 1 Corinthians 9:16, Apostle Paul said: <br><strong><em>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! </em></strong><br>When it comes to doing the work of God, you must not see yourself as a volunteer. Apostle Paul said doing God's work was a necessity, and he even went ahead to pronounce a curse on himself if he did not preach the gospel of Jesus. <br>Apostle Paul clearly did not see himself as a volunteer. God does not use people who see themselves as volunteers. Once God chooses someone, the fellow has no choice but to do the work. In John 15:16, God said you have not chosen Him, but He has chosen you. The moment He chooses you, the moment you find yourself as a minister of God, you must do what He wants. In Philippians 1:20, Paul said:<br> <strong><em>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. </em></strong><br>Workers are not volunteers but soldiers that must do the bidding of the One who has called them. 2 Timothy 2:4 says: <br><strong><em>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this Iife; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. </em></strong><br>Whether we like it or not, this world is a war front. We are at war and so, we should not distract ourselves with mundane things. We must be focused on obeying the commands of our Commandant promptly and completely. We must do the work required of us by Him so that we will be victorious. <br>In Matthew 28:19, our Commandant gave a command that directs those of us who call ourselves His workers and ministers to go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. The assignment is very clear, and it is a direct order. There is no room for deliberation; act now!",

      "There are many people who become born again and say that they don't want to preach the gospel. They think that as long as they don't backslide, they are fine. This is a fallacy. You have joined yourself to the Vine, and John 15:2 states clearly that every branch that is joined to the Vine must bear fruit. It is a must to bear fruit if you want to continue to be a part of the Vine. <br>Do you want to be a part of the Vine? You must do the work of an evangelist. Backsliding as a believer does not only start with drawing away from God and committing sin. Refusal to preach the gospel is also a form of backsliding. John 15:6 tells us that any branch the Father cuts off is going straight into the fire. <br>Some people who preach about unlimited grace usually say that once you are born again, nothing can ever send you to hell; I disagree completely with this theology. When people become born again, they become a part of the Vine, but if they do not produce fruits, they will be cut off from the Vine. When a person is cut off from the Vine, he or she will dry up, and men will gather whatever is left to be thrown into the fire – that is clearly what the word of God says. So, in your own interest, make sure you are bearing fruits for the Most High God. <br>Another reason you must win souls is so that your prayers can be answered. John 15:16 says: <br><strong><em>But I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. </em></strong><br>I don't know if you have observed that it appears as if God often sends the answers to the prayers of baby Christians relatively promptly. You probably experienced those prompt responses to your prayers when you freshly became born again, but now, does it appear as if you sometimes command mountains to move, and it seems like they refuse to yield? Has God changed? Does He no longer fulfil His promises? Why then are your answers being delayed? It just might be because you have not been winning souls.",

      "Many young people these days see their elders as 'old school' and think that they can do without them – they are making a big mistake. I know there's a lot of advancement in science and technology these days, and that the youth have more access to information than ever before, but no matter how many resources they have, there is one thing the elders have that they do not, and that is experience. <br>The elders have walked the path you are walking now and can tell you the outcome of whatever you are doing, even before you start. They have experienced far more than internet search engines can show you. Some of them have made mistakes in the past that you don't have to make if only you let them guide you. The problem, however, is that many youths think that they are very wise, and such thoughts can put them in trouble. <br>There is a popular saying in Africa that what an elder sees while sitting on a chair, the child cannot see it, even if he climbs an Iroko tree. I learnt a lot from the Late Pa S.G Elton though there were bits of advice he gave at the time that I thought were wrong. Today, I now know he was totally right. Thank God I listened to him. There are things about yourself that you don't know and cannot see, but an elder will see them and advise you appropriately. Proverbs 30:12 says: <br><strong><em>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness. </em></strong><br>You could think that your talent and knowledge are enough to make you successful, but an elder will point your attention to a character flaw that you must get rid of if you really want to be successful. <br>When you're employed in an organisation, respect those who have been there long before you. In church, give ears to what the elders have to say. At home, don't neglect the advice of your parents, grandparents, uncles and aunties. When you do this, they will share some of their valuable experiences with you, and with the help of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of wisdom (Isaiah 11:2), you will be able to put all their bits of advice together wisely. This will give you an unparalleled advantage over your peers in the journey of life.",

      "The lust of the eyes, the pride of life, and the lust of the flesh are reasons many take what belongs to other people. The obsession to have it all without working for them and being controlled by material things will eventually lead to stealing. God wants you to have everything you truly need but in His own way and at His own time. He is willing to give you everything you need and more, but you must seek Him and His righteousness first. <br>Nobody can bless you more than God, so it is better to wait for God's blessing because it will make you rich without any form of sorrow being added to it (Proverbs 10:22). Don't let the devil deceive you with flashy things. Mark 8:36 says that all the material gains in the world will profit you nothing if you lose your soul. Beloved, please do not trade your soul for material gains by stealing. Nothing at all in this world is worth your soul. <br>God frowns strongly at stealing. If you desire to have more, work more. Do not take from those who have laboured for their possessions. Some people try to categorise and rationalise stealing. For example, some people will say corruption is not stealing. Some will even try to explain why internet fraud is different from stealing. Beloved, the moment a person takes something that does not belong to him or her without the permission of the owner or under false pretences, that fellow has stolen. <br>In 1 Corinthians 6:10, the Bible makes it clear that no thief will enter heaven. The devil is the father of thieves because, according to John 10:10, stealing is his first assignment in any man's life. My father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, used to say that your father will take care of you with whatever he has. If your father is God, then He will take care of you with healing, blessings, and long life, but if your father is the devil, he will take care of you with sicknesses, marital problems, death, and the like. Thieves should never expect God to answer their prayers because God is not their father. <br>In Leviticus 6:4 and Exodus 22:1-4 God said that if you have stolen something, you are to return it to the fellow you stole from in double fold. Don't keep stolen property in your possession. Finally, let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth (Ephesians 4:28).",

      "Whenever God wants to talk to a congregation, no matter how large, He will address individuals. Revelations 3:20 was written to an entire Church, but He said, “If any man…” John 3:16 says,<strong><em> “God loved the whole world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever…” </em></strong><br>We came into this world one at a time. Genesis 25:21-26 makes it clear that even when twins are born, they come out one at a time. Even if the twins are to be delivered by a Caesarean operation, the doctor will bring one out first before the second. Romans 14:12 says that we are all going to give an account of ourselves before God. The messages you read in this devotional are not for everybody, they are for you in particular. <br>Whenever David wants to talk about something very serious, he personalises it. In Psalm 23:1, he said, “The Lord is MY shepherd; I shall not want.” He didn't say, “The Lord is our shepherd.” Whenever some brethren want to close a service, they will say, “Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow us all the days of our lives, and we shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” I always wonder where they got that from because it is not written in my Bible. What is written is, <strong><em>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever” </em></strong>(Psalm 23:6). Goodness and mercy are not for us they are for me. The result of my dwelling is for me, not for us. <br>In Psalm 27:8, David said, “When you said, seek my face, my heart says, thy face will I seek.” I don't know what others are thinking, how far they want to go in the Lord, and how hungry and thirsty for God they are. I cannot thirst and hunger for God on their behalf. Don't let someone else's lack of hunger for God affect you, even if he is your pastor. Your walk with God is personal. When you come face to face with God in judgement, you will give an account of yourself individually. So, if you see someone who does not take his Christian life seriously, don't let it bother you; Christianity is an individual matter. <br>Seek the face of God and encourage others to do so, but don't let their laxity influence you.",

      "When Jesus Christ was on the cross, He appeared to be helpless. This was a man who could call 12 legions of angels to come to His rescue, yet, He was nailed to a cross, and it seemed like he was helpless. Truly, what can a person whose hands and feet have been nailed to a cross do? For example, while Jesus was on the cross, he said, “I thirst.” Instead of giving Him water, they gave Him vinegar, and He could do nothing about it. This was not because He did not have the power to do whatever He wanted, but because if He had saved Himself at that time, you and I would have become preys to the devil. So, because of His love for us, He was helpless. He became helpless so that you can be helped. If you have been washed by the blood of Jesus, you will never lack help, in Jesus' name. <br>On the cross, Jesus was lonely. He cried in Matthew 27:46, “…My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.” He was not even talking about how His disciples forsook Him. They left Him when He was arrested, but now, even God forsook Him. That was the biggest heartbreak for Him because there had never been a time when God was not with Him. However, He went through all that so that God can be with you always. He went through that gruelling experience so that you will never be alone and so that whenever you call on God, He will answer you. <br>Everything that happened at Calvary was sorrowful for Jesus; you cannot experience such pain and shame and not be sorrowful. He, however, put Himself through that sorrow so that you can have joy. Therefore, if you are truly washed in the blood of Jesus Christ, everything causing you sorrow is banished now, in Jesus' name. <br>He did it all for you to have a life that is beyond what this world can give you – eternal life. The question now is, are you enjoying the benefits of the sacrifice He made for you on the cross? Are you truly washed in His blood? Are you living your life like Christ? The benefits of the sacrifice He paid are only for those who live holy. Anyone who truly lives holy will experience the benefits of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. I have made up my mind to live holy for the rest of my life, what about you?",

      "Jesus knows the end from the beginning, so He knew that what was going to happen to Him on the cross would be very terrible. This made Him pray in Matthew 26:39, saying, <strong><em>“…O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”</em></strong> The Bible recorded that while He was saying this prayer, His sweat was like blood. This tells us that He took that prayer very seriously. Yet, Jesus still decided to go through with the suffering. <br>Jesus did not lay down His life out of compulsion. He said clearly in John 10:18 that He laid down His life willingly. That statement is heavy, and it made me ask, “What kind of love will make a man surrender Himself to be humiliated and slaughtered like this?”<br>I saw the perfect answer to my question in John 15:13 which says: <br><strong><em>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</em></strong> <br>This is the greatest kind of love in the world. Jesus loves you more than anyone in the world can ever love you, and He showed it by laying down His life for you. <br>Again, I asked myself, “What will make a man surrender His life like this?” I saw the answer to this question in John 10:11-12. The Good Shepherd never deserts the sheep when He sees a wolf coming. He stays and protects the sheep from being devoured because of the love He has for the sheep. The devil is the wolf that tries to steal, kill and destroy, while Jesus is the Good Shepherd that laid down His life for you to have eternal life. <br>Jesus is the only genuine protection you can get from the claws of the wolf – the devil. If you believe in Him, and surrender your life to Him, the wolf will have no power over you because Jesus has already died for you. The wolf, however, is free to devour anyone that is not following Jesus or believers that stray away from Him. <br>Beloved, if you don't want to be prey to the devil, give your life to Jesus Christ now. Commit to following Him and Him alone. He paid the ultimate price for you, and He is the only One that can lead you into everlasting life.",

      "Consecration means being totally surrendered to God, in other words, holding on to Him and Him alone. Unfortunately, a lot of people hold on to Jesus with one hand and hold on to the world with the other. How do you explain Christians who claim to have given their all to Christ but who still consult witch doctors over challenging situations? Truly consecrated Christians are ready to go all the way for God. Such people may go through a lot of suffering for the Lord, but they will still count it all joy, as long as God is with them (James 1:2). <br>A good example of a genuinely consecrated person was Apostle Paul. He was totally sold out to God, such that even when God warned him about being apprehended in Jerusalem, he still went there to preach the gospel (Acts 21:11-14). He was so consecrated that he declared in Galatians 2:20: <br><strong><em>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. </em></strong><br>Consecrated people care about God more than anyone or anything else. I was watching an interview on Dove Television one day, and the guest said that in the past, all Christians cared about was for God to use them, but nowadays, people are more interested in how they can use God. Many people just use Christianity as a cover-up to look good in the society, but when a little test comes, they denounce Christ. For example, these days, many Christians compromise their faith to get married. They wear revealing outfits to attract men, attend ungodly gatherings with the hope of finding suitors, and worse still, engage in premarital sex. <br>A missionary's inspiring story greatly impacted my decision to be consecrated to God. She was serving in an area that was hostile to Christianity. On her wedding day, while she was getting ready, the authorities raided her home and arrested her for preaching the gospel. Instead of crying, she smiled, kissed the handcuffs and said, “Lord, I didn't know I was so special to You that You didn't want to share me with anyone else. How beautiful is Your wedding ring to me.” She was so sold out to God that while others saw a disaster, she saw the handcuffs as God's wedding ring to her as His bride. <br>Beloved, are you consecrated to Jesus?",

      "There are many people who have received an impartation of God's anointing; however, miracles are yet to happen through them. When a fellow receives the anointing, it remains dormant in him or her until it is stirred up. When Elisha got Elijah's mantle, it remained an ordinary cloth until he used it to strike the river and asked the river to part.<br> I once attended a Kenneth Hagin meeting in Tulsa, USA, and saw a raw demonstration of the power of God. I made up my mind to see him, and by God's grace, I was able to. He asked me, “Young man, what do you want?” I replied, “Sir, I want everything in you that has made you who you are.” After attending to everyone else in his office, he turned to me and said, “Young man, kneel down.” I knelt and saw his two big hands coming towards my head – that was the last thing I remembered. By the time I came around, I was on the floor, and he was kneeling by me with his hands on my head while praying furiously in tongues. <br>When we returned to Nigeria, I begged Papa, the General Superintendent of RCCG, to let me line people up and pray for them. In those days, we didn't pray for anybody, everyone prayed by themselves. Papa allowed me, and so, during the evening service on that Sunday, we lined people up. Some people who had been in Tulsa with me saw that people fell when Kenneth Hagin laid hands on them, so, they came to stand behind the people that were lined up to catch them if they fell. I laid hands on the first fellow, but he didn't fall. I wasn't discouraged because I knew that people falling is not necessarily an indication that miracles have happened. However, by the time I got to the seventh fellow, someone fell under the anointing. After that, a couple of others also fell. I stirred up the gift that I had received and then saw it work mightily.<br> If hands have been laid on you, or you have been anointed by a man of God, it is not time to relax. The impartation will remain dormant if you don't use it. Look for opportunities to pray for people and stir up the gift. The first fellow you pray for may not be healed immediately, however, keep stirring the gift, and soon, you will see it work mightily.",

You may then ask, “Why have I not been able to perform any miracle thus far?”<br> In Mark 3:13-15, Jesus' disciples were told what to do. They were to keep Him company, preach, heal sicknesses, and cast out demons. The reason most Christians have not been working miracles is that they have not been following this order. How much time do you spend fellowshipping with God? This is the first step in working miracles. You must spend quality time studying your Bible and praying daily. The more time you spend in His company, the more His power will rest on you. <br>You are also required to preach the gospel. In Matthew 28:19, Jesus said,<strong><em> “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” </em></strong><br>Many believers don't evangelize. God will not give you the power to work miracles just so you can show off, He will only do so if you will use it to win souls for Him. If you get these first two steps right, the power to work miracles will follow duly.<br> Many people feel it is not compulsory for them to have the power of God.

If I am not concerned when somebody dies, I won't pray much before I ask the family members to arrange for the burial of the fellow. If you truly understand that God is expecting you to be the channel through which He will heal the sick and raise the dead, that it is a must that you cast out demons and that some demons won't leave except by prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21), your attitude to food and pleasure should change.<br> If you are His disciple, according to Mark 3:13-15, you are expected to heal the sick. Every now and then, God will send you to raise the dead, cast out demons, and cleanse people with incurable diseases (Matthew 10:7- 8). If you are His disciple, it is compulsory that you pay the price and receive the power to work miracles.",

      "Many brings about miracles. When they see a man of God lay hands on a sick person and the sick person gets healed, they want to know what passed from his hand into the sick fellow's body that caused the healing. When they say someone fell under the anointing, the question is, what is the anointing? <br>The anointing can be described as 'heavenly electricity', generated by the Holy Spirit. In other words, just like we have electricity here on earth that powers most of our appliances, the anointing is the electricity of heaven. When you see an anointed fellow, that fellow has connected himself to the generator of the anointing in heaven, which is the Holy Spirit, and he now has the heavenly electricity flowing in him. Acts 1:8 says that you will receive power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you. It is that connection with the Holy Ghost that makes the anointing flow through you. You must note, however, that the anointing is not the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the generator of the anointing. The Holy Spirit is God Himself.<br> How then do you connect with the Holy Spirit in order to get the anointing? The first thing you must note is that He is called the Holy Spirit because He cannot be near anything that is unholy. If you want to connect with the Holy Spirit, you must be holy. God will not anoint a sinner. Amos 3:3 says that two cannot walk together except they be agreed. If you are not holy, the Holy Spirit cannot work in you.<br>Also, just as you connect with a man when you speak his language, you connect with the Holy Spirit when you speak in tongues. The more you speak in tongues, the more heavenly electricity you are generating into your body and the more anointed you will be. You see, how anointed you are depends heavily on how much faith you have. Jude 1:20 says that you build up your holy faith by speaking in the Holy Ghost. So, the more you speak in the Holy Ghost, the greater your faith will be. The greater your faith, the more anointing you will have to do the impossible. You must note also that there are some levels of the anointing that you cannot reach if you don't add regular fasting to your regular prayers (Matthew 17:21).",

      "An electric iron is really just a piece of iron until it is connected to electricity. When you connect an electric iron into electricity, it becomes something you can smoothen your rough clothes with. A television basically a screen with some components and wires attached to it. When there is no electricity, it is just there, capable of nothing. However, the moment you connect it to electricity, you will be able to see what is happening in another part of the world in real time. This is how the anointing works, it changes the ordinary to the extraordinary.<br> In Judges 15:14-15, when they brought Samson before the Philistines, and they began to rejoice, the Bible says that the Spirit of God came mightily upon him and the ropes binding him were burnt as with fire. Then, he grabbed the jawbone of a dead ass, and as soon as the jawbone came in contact with the anointing, it became a weapon of mass destruction. The anointing turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.<br> Electricity, in its raw form, is like fire. You may not see it that way because it is controlled before it is passed into your house. In the same vein, the anointing is fire. When the Holy Ghost fell on the people at the upper room, they could see cloven tongues of fire on each person's head. The difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle is fire. You can ride up to 100 kilometres on a bicycle using your physical strength, but by the time you are done, they may need to pour water on you. However, if you are on a motorcycle, you will cover the same distance in less time and without stress. That is what the anointing does. When you see a man working like ten men put together, and instead of getting tired, he remains fresh, the anointing is the difference. So, whenever you are anointed, what you are receiving is the firepower to achieve things that are beyond your normal capacity. <br>The anointing is not only for pastors. An anointed doctor will successfully handle medical cases that other doctors cannot handle. An anointed businessman will achieve greater feats than his normal capacity can achieve. When the anointing comes upon you, you are empowered to do more than you can ever imagine. For example, the anointing made Elijah outrun Ahab's chariot (1 Kings 18:46).<br> Beloved, I encourage you to seek God's anointing; it will give you tremendous speed and turn your life around for good.",

      "When the anointing is handed positively, it's effect are similar with handling electricity positively. When electricity is handled properly, it can produce light and heat just like with the microwave, but when handled carelessly, it can destroy. When handled the right way, the anointing can destroy yokes, according to Isaiah 10:27. However, when it is handled wrongly, it can kill. If a fellow messes around with electricity, he or she will get roasted.<br><br> In 2 Kings 1:9-12, a king sent some soldiers to arrest Elijah, and the captain met the man of God sitting on a hill. The captain ordered, “Man of God, come down.” Elijah answered, “So you know I'm a man of God, and you are talking to me like that? Roast!” Immediately, fire came down from heaven and burnt the captain and his soldiers. When the king waited, and those 51 soldiers didn't come back, he sent another 50 soldiers with their captain. When the captain got there, he saw ashes on the floor. Speaking to Elijah, he was even more rude and said, “Man of God, come down quickly.” Again, Elijah roasted them. When people disdain the anointing, it may cost them their lives.<br> Years ago, when the military was ruling in Nigeria, the then-military head of state wanted to become a democratic ruler. His spiritual advisers told him that what he wanted to do would not succeed because of a man called Adeboye, who was always praying for the country in the Redemption Camp (now Redemption City). I was in the camp when one of my children who was privileged to hear the information came and said, “Daddy, you have to travel quickly, they are coming for you.” Although I am anointed, I was troubled. Fortunately, my wife wasn't there when the message was delivered. Later that night, I told her that I wanted to go and pray. While I was praying, God spoke. He said, “Don't worry about him, I have taken care of the situation.” Though it was the month of June, God told me to tell people to wish each other a happy new year during the Holy Ghost service. The Holy Ghost service held on a Friday, and by Sunday, the military dictator had been removed permanently. <br>Don't joke with the anointing. One of the biggest mistakes we make as Christians is that we tend to get too familiar with the anointing. When people find an anointed man of God who is humble, there is a tendency to get overfamiliar with him, and this can be dangerous.",

      "Yesterday I talked about how dangerous the anointing can be when it is not properly handled. However, many anointed people believe that the caution to be careful with the anointing does not apply to them. This is not true. The fact that you are anointed does not give you permission to cause another anointed man of God harm. This is one of the major killers of some ministers of God; they speak evil of their colleagues, and when the repercussions come, they go to God complaining and wondering why things are not going well with them.<br> In 1 Samuel 24:1-6, a rare opportunity presented itself for David to kill King Saul, who had been seeking ways to kill him. David's followers were happy about the opportunity, but David refused to kill him. However, so that Saul would know that he came close enough to kill him, he cut off a small part of his clothes. The Bible says his heart smote him, meaning that he was uncomfortable with what he did. Even though God had forsaken Saul, David still acknowledged that he could not lift his hand against him because he was anointed. <br>I remember when I was ordained a pastor and got anointed, for three days after they poured the oil on my head, I didn't take my bath because I treasure the anointing. It took me a while to realise that no amount of soap can wash away the anointing. Once a person has been anointed, the fellow remains anointed even when he or she backslides. Even in that backslidden state, you must be careful of how you treat the person because of the anointing. I have never said anything negative about pastors who have left The Redeemed Christian Church of God dishonourably. The reason is that the oil is still on their head, and I don't want any trouble with God. <br>The only exception is when God Himself authorizes the action. For example, God may use the vessel that He used to anoint a man of God to deal with the same man of God. In this case, the vessel is acting as a representative of God. In 1 Samuel 15:27-29, Samuel refused to worship with Saul, and because Saul didn't want to be embarrassed in front of his cabinet, he pulled Samuel back and tore his clothes. Samuel turned around and said, “Your kingdom is torn from you.” He made it clear that the reason he was making that decree was that the Lord who sent him to anoint Saul was pronouncing judgement on him.",

      "Yesterday I made it clear that the anointed is not to dishonoured for any reason. Now, the question someone may have in mind is, “What do we do with ministers of God who we believe to be erring?” This is a very delicate situation that requires God's wisdom and direction. For example, in our Bible reading today, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of something they believed he did wrong. At the end of the day, Miriam became leprous, and Moses had to pray to God for her to be healed. <br>It is not in your place to judge God's servants; leave their judgments to their Master. In Romans 12:19, the Bible says clearly that vengeance is His, just report the matter to God, and He will deal with His anointed as He pleases.<br> Anointed ministers of God cannot hide under the canopy of being God's anointed and begin to treat His sheep the way they like. Hebrews 10:31 says that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; believe me, a fellow should not experience God dealing with him or her Himself. The reason we discipline erring workers is to shield them from God doing it Himself. When a pastor misbehaves, and the General Overseer suspends him, it is so that the Consuming Fire Himself will not be the one to do it. So, if a pastor overlooks a fellow's wrongdoings because of his or her contributions to the church treasury, that pastor is doing more harm than good because God Himself will come in, and nobody wants to fall into the hands of the living God.<br> In 2 Samuel 11, David used his position to snatch another man's wife and also got him killed. Nobody could punish him as there was no one who was superior to the king. God had to step in to punish him. From that point on, there was no peace in David's home. Not long after, one of his sons, Amnon, raped his half-sister, and then another son, Absalom, killed him. Later, Absalom rose up against his father. To date, the sword has not departed from Israel on account of the Lord's judgement over David (2 Samuel 12:9-10).<br> When a person is anointed by God and uses that anointing to cheat others, when God punishes that fellow, the punishment might last throughout his or her lineage from generation to generation.",

      "The anointing makes you a blessing to all kinds of people. In 2 Kings 4:1-7, Elisha was a blessing to a poor widow. You can put an end to someone's poverty because you are anointed. Also, you can become a blessing, even to the rich and powerful. You can sit in your room and tell a rich fellow, “Go and wash,” as Elisha told Naaman, and if the fellow obeys, he will be healed. It is important to note, however, that if an anointed person blesses others solely for monetary gains, the problem of the rich will become the fellow's problem as Naaman's leprosy came upon Gehazi (2 Kings 5:20-27).<br> The anointing gives you the power to put smiles on the faces of people who would otherwise have been sorrowful. When I turned 80, I insisted that I wasn't throwing a party. However, some General Overseers gathered in my office after the Holy Ghost Service that day. When they were asked to share testimonies, one of them, a medical doctor who is now a General Overseer, said two of his daughters became terribly sick. One was already gasping for breath when all of a sudden, he thought, “I have prayed, and nothing has happened, at least I know someone whose anointing is more than mine,” so he called me that night. When he told me what was happening, God asked me to tell him to do some things. When he started doing what I asked him to do, the other doctors that were with him started wondering what he was doing. He told them this wasn't medicine, but an instruction that came from Redemption Camp. The children survived miraculously, and today, one of them is a doctor, and I think the other is an engineer. If you want to be able to turn sorrow away from families, pursue God's anointing. <br>The anointing also gives you divine security. Our God is like a coin that has two sides, He is Love (1 John 4:8), and He is also a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29). When He says touch not my anointed, He is saying, “Don't touch fire.” In Africa, we have a saying that even when a dog is mad, it still recognises fire. No matter how crazy a man may be, he will never walk into a fire. When you are anointed, you become too dangerous for the devil to touch.",

      "Do you want to be heavily anointed? The one who generates the anointing has more than enough for everybody. Psalm 23:5 says, <strong><em>“Thou anointed my head with oil, my cup runneth over.” </em></strong>He has more than enough for everybody, but are you willing to pay the price? Are you willing to go through the challenges that come with being anointed? Hebrews 1:9 says that if you love righteousness and hate iniquity, God will anoint you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.<br> Yesterday, I mentioned some benefits of being anointed, but it is also important to note that the anointing also comes with some challenges. The major challenge with being anointed is that power can corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The more anointed you are, the more careful you must be because of the tendency to misuse the power. In Numbers 20:1-13, especially verse 10, Moses said to the people, “Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?”<br> Only a few minutes before then, he was on his face before God, asking for a solution to the problem. The moment God told him what to do, he turned to the people who had been provoking him, called them rebels, and spoke as if the power to bring water out of the rock was from him and not from God. In verse 12, God said that because he did not sanctify Him in the eyes of the people, he will not enter the promised land.<br> I have always told pastors in The Redeemed Christian Church of God that no one must ever feel as if he healed anybody. Left alone, you cannot even heal a rat! It is God who heals, and you are only a vessel through which the healing takes place. You must always see that as a privilege. Since the power to perform miracles is not yours, God can use anyone else to do it. A man of God once said that if you remove God from him, there will be little left. I was surprised because, in my own case, if you remove God from me, there will be absolutely nothing left. <br>Beloved, never forget that without God, you are nothing. Anyone who thinks that he or she can be something without God is clearly on a path to destruction. No matter how anointed you are, never allow yourself to think that you are all-powerful.

      "In continuation of my discussion yesterday, one of the challenges of being anointed is that anointed people are perceived to be stronger than they really are. Because they pray and God answers immediately, people think that they don't need prayers themselves. Also, because they lay hands on the sick and the sick get healed, people think that they are superhuman and can never be weak or tired. Because they preach and souls get saved, there is a tendency to think that they never get tempted, whereas they probably face temptations more than other people. <br>Moses made just one mistake in 40 years of leading the Israelites, but God said he would not get to the promised land. He had been interceding for Israel whenever they did terrible things, and God had been forgiving them. Now, in his own case, there was nobody to plead for him. <br>Do you want to be heavily anointed? Be ready to work endlessly. When I discovered that the Bible says that we should earnestly covet spiritual gifts, I was happy. I asked for double the anointing on Elisha, Peter, Paul and Jesus Christ when He was on the earth and then asked that all should be combined and doubled again. God warned me then that I was asking for a dangerous thing because people would not let me rest. When people see that you are anointed, they will bring all their problems to you. Even after you minister to them from the altar, they will still want to see you personally. You cannot send them away because the purpose of the anointing is to serve. <br>When I employed a personal assistant, and he asked, “What are our work hours?” I said, “We start the day at 5am and only God knows when we will close.” This is why raising other people who will also become anointed is necessary. RCCG is in over 190 nations in the world. How will I cope if every member comes to me with their problems? This is why each local assembly has anointed pastors that can pray for the members; only the cases they can't handle come to me. God has also made things easier by making it possible for me to pray from the altar and anoint handkerchiefs which are used to perform the miracles that people would have called the General Overseer to pray about in the past. <br><br>A lot of responsibilities and challenges come with being anointed, so if you desire to be anointed, you should be ready to embrace them.",

      "In my studies on this topic, I noticed that apostle Paul who said in Philippians 4:7 <strong><em>\"but what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ,</em></strong>” was promoted so highly that in 2 Corinthians 12:11, he said, “I'm not behind the greatest apostles.” When we talk about promotion, many of us think about titles. Titles are beautiful, but I will rather be a deacon that can raise the dead than be a National Pastor that cannot heal a fly. <br>I preached a message on total surrender one day in church. In those days, only a few members had cars. After the service, a young man came to me and said, “Daddy, from now on, I surrender all to Jesus.” I said, “Really?” He said, “Yes”. I then said, “Good. So, we will now be able to borrow your car tomorrow for a church assignment.” He replied, “But I have to go to work tomorrow”. I laughed and said, “I just wanted to show you that you haven't surrendered all.” I only asked about the church borrowing his car, and that was difficult for him to agree to. What if I had asked for something bigger?<br> What could make an individual surrender totally to God and even serve Him without pay? I found the reason in Philippians 2:5-11 which is our Bible reading for today. It started by saying, <strong><em>“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:”</em></strong> It further told us how great Jesus was and how He humbled Himself unto the point of death, even the death on the cross. Then verse 9 says, <strong><em>“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him…” </em></strong>At that point, I knew that the gain always outweighs the pain. Hebrews 12:2 says:<br> <strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</strong><br> When you seek the things of God first, the other desires of your heart will also be granted unto you according to His will. When you lay your life down for God, He will surely honour you in return. There is great joy awaiting anyone who surrenders totally to God. If you surrender all that you have to Him, He will give you more in return. Beloved, surrender all to God and He will bless you far beyond your imagination.",

      "<strong><em>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. John 9:4</em></strong><br>The above passage says, “The works of Him that sent me,” not the works of your pastor. This was why I laughed when I heard someone say to me some time ago, “I've been serving you all these years.” I was amazed, so I responded, “Serving me?!” I thought we were serving God together on the same platform. You need to really know whom you are serving. Are you serving God, your pastor, or your Head of Department in church? If you are serving God, you won't only behave well when your pastor or Head of Department is around, but you will do so at all times because the One you claim to be serving can see you all the time. <br>For some people, they are serving their Neighbours. They want their Neighbours to see them as fervent Christians, but, in secret, they keep committing sins. If you really know you are serving God, you will care more about being holy in His eyes than looking holy in public. Revelations 4:11 says, “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” You are to please God irrespective of the people around you. <br>Lastly, some people claim to be serving God, but they are actually serving their needs; they come to Him only because they need something from Him. Everything they do for God is motivated by what they want to get from Him. For example, this is why there are people who reduce their commitment in church or even stop going altogether once they get the job that they have been praying about. For some, they are only in church because they are looking for a godly husband or wife to marry. In John 6:24-26, Jesus sent the people who were coming to Him because of bread and fish away. Such people's service is not acceptable to Him; He can see their real intentions and does not count them among His children. <br>Are you serving God, people or your needs? Beloved, you need to be very clear about whom you serve. Serve God for who He is, and not for anything else.",

      "God loves unity; wherever He finds people uniting in His name, He will show up. You can see a good example of this in 2 Chronicles 5:13:<br><strong><em> It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD; </em></strong><br>In the above passage, as the trumpeters, singers and musicians all sang as one, God's presence came down like a cloud and filled the temple. God loves it when His children worship Him in one accord. This is why Jesus Christ said in Matthew 18:20, “Where two or three people are gathered in my name, there will I be.” At the upper room in Acts 2, the Bible says that when the people were in one accord, the Holy Spirit filled the room with a sound like a mighty rushing wind. Wherever believers are gathered in unity, God will show up in His glory. <br>Today's Bible reading tells us that when brethren come together in unity, it is like the anointing oil that was poured on Aaron's head which went all the way down to his feet. Do you know what that means? It means that it is only when God's people are united that the anointing can flow amongst them. Without unity, the corporate anointing will not flow. The reason many churches are not experiencing the power of God amongst them is that they are not united. Where there is gossip, strife and backbiting, don't expect the power of God to flow. These vices are not of God, and so, God cannot be where they exist. <br>1 Corinthians 12:12 says that we are all different parts of one body. If the hand is envious of the eyes and the leg is keeping malice with the head, how can the body function effectively? When we become united in our local assembly and in the body of Christ as a whole, we will see great miracles amongst us that will amaze the whole world. If you are a pastor reading this now, you should ensure that all forms of strife amongst workers and/or members of your local assembly are resolved today.",

      "There are many Christians who say that they do not take nonsense from anybody. However, these same people take nonsense from the devil. Whether you take nonsense from people or not is not very important, what is most important is that you do not take nonsense from the devil. The Bible says: <strong><em>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: </em></strong>1 Peter 5:8 <br>Will you sit around and let him come and devour you? You should stand your ground against him and set his tail on fire so that he can run far away from you.<br>One of my daughters shared a testimony some time ago. Her child was sick, and they took the child to the hospital. On getting there, the doctor said that there was nothing he could do to save the child. The woman asked, “In that case, can you refer us to another hospital?” The doctor referred them, and on their way, they got stuck in a terrible traffic jam. While in the traffic jam, the child died. The woman said, “I am not going to take this,” and after five hours on the road, she suddenly had a brainwave. She said, “At least my father will call his God, and his God will answer. I will call on the God of my father, and I even have a handkerchief that he once prayed over.” She laid the handkerchief on the child, called the child's name and commanded him to come back to life. The child jerked awake, and there was no need to go to the hospital anymore.<br>When you are determined not to let something evil happen, your prayers will be more fervent than usual. There are probably things in your life that the devil has been using to torment you. These things will only stop when you become determined not to take any nonsense from him again. If you have been praying gentle prayers concerning these things, it is time to use your authority in Christ and start issuing commands in your prayers.<br>You must however, submit yourself to God first before you can successfully stand up to the devil. James 4:7 says:<br><strong><em>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</em></strong><br>If you are sure of your right standing with God, when you resist the devil, he will run away from you. Stop taking nonsense from him!",

      "Many Christians don't pray aloud anymore, and this is one of the reasons we are seeing fewer demonstrations of power among us. During the first service I attended at RCCG, we were asked to shout hallelujah, and the fellow beside me shouted so loudly that I almost ran out of the church. Where there is power, there must be noise. The Concorde, a plane that could take you from London to New York in about three hours, was grounded partly because people said it was noisy. With its powerful engine, it was bound to be noisy.<br>These days, many Christians have to be cajoled to shout 'hallelujah'. I remember many years ago when I was asked to preach during a Christmas carol at Aso Rock, and all the high and mighty were there. When I asked them to shout hallelujah, they shouted like sophisticated ladies and gentlemen, until I said, “The next fellow to shout hallelujah is the only one who will see the new year.” This time around, they really shouted. Real Christians do not have to be threatened to praise their Father.<br>Many years ago, I was walking and praying within Redemption City in the middle of the night, hungry and thirsty for the power of God. I had been crying, “Lord, I told You from the beginning that I don't want to be ordinary. I was serving You as much as I could when I was still lecturing at the university, making some money to do Your work, but you pulled me out. Now, You have made me a General Overseer, and I lack the power to do the work that must be done. Father, either empower me or take me home.” As I prayed, the ground under my feet shook violently. There was an earthquake that was felt from as far as Ijebu-Ode – it was in the newspapers. An earthquake is not quiet. Noise is necessary for power; stop trying not to be noisy. Don't hinder the move of God with your so-called sophistication.<br>I am at a point in my life where I need other people to carry more fire than me so that when I am leaving, I will know that I am leaving commandos behind that will take the work of God farther than I did. Stop forming, as the youths will say, when you are in the presence of God. Be free to make a loud noise that will shut the devil out and let the power of God flow.",

      "When you hear the expression 'God is smiling on you,' it means you are enjoying divine favour and grace. In Numbers 6:24-26, God said that the sons of Aaron were to pronounce a blessing on the people, and the blessing went thus:<br> <strong><em>The LORD bless thee,and keep thee: The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</em></strong><br>When God's face is shining upon you, it means the Lord is smiling upon you and you will enjoy divine favour everywhere you go. It also means that every darkness around you will be consumed, and you will be basking in His light.<br>When God decides to show you favour, you will achieve more than somebody who is working extremely hard without divine favour. When God shows you favour, miracles happen. For example, Genesis 24:63 says that Isaac went for a stroll and in the 67th verse of the same chapter, the Bible says:<br><strong><em> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</em></strong><br>All the background work in getting Isaac a wife was done by some other people. When you compare Isaac's experience to that of Jacob, who laboured for 14 years without pay before he could get the woman he wanted to marry, you will see the difference between favour and hard labour to get what you want. I decree that from now on, God will show you favour.<br>Not too long ago, all the universities in Nigeria were ranked, and Redeemer's University came second. The first was the University of Ibadan, the oldest university in Nigeria, founded in 1948. Redeemer's University was only 17 years old at that time, and we beat universities that were more than 60 years old. How could this be? The only explanation can be divine favour.<br>The question now is, what can you do to always enjoy divine favour? You can find a good answer to this question in Proverbs 3:3-4 which says:<br><strong><em>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</em></strong><br>To draw God's favour to yourself, always tell the truth and show mercy to others.",

      "In Genesis 1:1-5, God called the light 'day' and the darkness 'night'. The combination of both gave us the first day. When you dig deeper, you will discover that a day is broken into three parts – morning, afternoon and evening. In Psalm 55:17, David said, <strong><em>“Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.” </em></strong>Day is God's unit of measuring the time of man on earth. Psalm 90:12 says, <strong><em>“Teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.”</em></strong> Proverbs 10:27 tells us that although God can lengthen a fellow's days, He can also shorten them.<br>According to the memory verse for today, the morning is the time for growing up, and it is the time for joy (Psalm 30:5). When you are growing up as a child, you have no responsibilities. When children wake up in the morning, they want breakfast to be on the table, and how it gets there is none of their business. Listen to a child laugh, and you will also begin to laugh because their laughter is right from the inside. The afternoon is when you are at your peak, and the sun is at its brightest. Job 11:17 talks about age being clearer than the noonday. The noon is the peak of life. The evening is when things begin to become dim, and the sun is about to set. 1 Samuel 4:15 says that Eli was 98 years old and his eyes waxed dim. Psalm 104:23 says that man goes to his work and begins to return home in the evening. Your evening is when you begin to round off your life.<br>It is pertinent to know which part of your day you are in so that you can act wisely and make the best out of it. However, if you don't know, you could be trying to achieve good results with the wrong method. This is why those who fear God are called wise because even though they grow old, they have wisdom and can still do what strong people cannot. There is a time to use strength primarily, and there is a time to use less of strength and more of wisdom. There is a time to run and a time to pass the baton. You must recognise your times and seasons to make the best out of your life.",

In 1 John 2:14 <strong><em>“I have written to you young ones because you are strong.” </em></strong>The major characteristic of youths is their strength.<br>I know most youths see their youthful days as days to enjoy themselves. This is true, according to Ecclesiastes 11:9-10:<br><strong><em>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth…but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment… </em></strong><br>Note that the above passage also says that youths will account for the seeds they sow later in life. Those that spend their youthful days engaging in all sorts of vices will reap plenty of trouble later in life (Galatians 6:7). In Genesis 49:1- 4, when Israel was about to die, he called his children together and began to prophesy about their future. He said concerning Reuben, “Mighty Reuben, excellency of strength…but you will not excel.” Why did he say this? In Genesis 35:22, Reuben did something that he should not have done, and his father heard about it. Now, when his father was about to die, he told him he would not excel, even though he was the firstborn. When you read Revelation 7:1- 5, you'll be amazed that by the time they were listing the children of Israel who were sealed, Reuben was no longer the first.<br>Beloved, if you are young now, meaning that you're less than 30 years old, make good use of your youth. Be careful of the kinds of seeds you sow now because you will reap their fruits later, and the harvest is always greater than the seed sown.<br><strong><em>…I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. </em>1 John 2:14<em> </em></strong><br>The above passage does not only say that you are strong as a youth, but also that the word of God is to abide in you, and you are to overcome the wicked one. Your youthful days are the days to soak in the word of God like never before. This is the time to memorise as many scriptures as possible. Now is the time to build your spiritual strength to stand against the devil and overcome him. Use your strength to do a lot for God because a time will come when you will discover that being a youth does not last forever.",

John the Baptist, the greatest of the Old Testament prophets (Luke 7:28), also started around the same age. Samson, by the time he killed a thousand people, was around 30 years of age. David, when he became king, was also about that age. Phillip, when he was turning Samaria around for God, was also in the noon phase of his life. There is a saying:<br><strong><em>“There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune, neglected, all the voyages of their lives are bound in shallows and mysteries.” </em></strong><br>The noon time is when the flood comes. If you are a pastor, around this time, there is hardly any sermon you will preach that will not be appreciated. With very little effort, the church grows, but the flood does not last forever. If you miss that flood, you will get to a stage where it would not matter how well you preach because people will say, “We've heard this before.”<br>The noontime is probably what God was referring to when He said in Isaiah 60:1-5, <strong><em>“Arise, shine, for your light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you.”</em></strong> God is smiling on your efforts. There are those who made good use of their flood and, as a result, were able to keep going when the evening came.<br>There was a young man whom God used to perform miracles, signs and wonders. He prospered so mightily that he reserved a presidential suite in Sheraton Hotel permanently for himself. In those days, he was always travelling with five Mercedes Benz cars. The number plates carried the name of the ministry, and each one was tagged 'Ministry 1', 'Ministry 2', 'Ministry 3', and so on. After a while, however, the flood subsided. Money stopped flowing in, the cars disappeared, and the police began to look for him because of the money he was owing the hotel.<br>Don't misuse the flood when it comes. Be wise to use your brightest moments so well that the brightness will remain, even when the evening comes. Don't waste your resources. Don't mismanage your health and the relationships God sends your way. These are some of the things that will keep the brightness when the evening comes.",

      "If you are above 50, you are already in the second half of your day and you need to apply wisdom more than ever before. By evening, you are supposed to be relying more on wisdom, not on strength as the flood might have subsided. You may refer to yesterday's teaching to understand what I mean by the flood. Job 12:12 says that wisdom is supposed to be with the ancient; years are supposed to teach wisdom. Job 32:7 says that days should speak, and multitudes of years should teach wisdom. This is why it is said that a fool at 40 is a fool forever. You are supposed to have become wise by the time you are 40 because as people grow older, they naturally become weaker.<br>Nobody will believe, except those who are close to me, that I used to be a boxer. Nobody will believe that there was a time I could carry a bag of cement in one hand and another in the second and say that I was balancing the equation. Now, even with two hands, I will think twice before I pick up a bag of cement.<br>In 2 Samuel 21:15-17, the Bible says that David waxed faint. This was the same person who killed a lion and a bear (1 Samuel 17:34-35). He was the same person that delivered 200 foreskins when he was asked to get a hundred (1 Samuel 18:25-27). David, the giant killer, the one who single-handedly cut off Goliath's head, waxed faint, and he would have been killed in battle if somebody had not come to his aid. What lesson can we learn from that? When David was at his peak, he had prepared for the time he would grow faint. In 1 Samuel 22:1-2, when he was in the cave of Adullam, he gathered some vagabonds and turned them into mighty men. It was one of his boys that was there to help him when his evening came.<br>In 2 Samuel 23:1-39, we read of the people he had prepared who were now called 'David's mighty men'. These men risked their lives by taking on an entire army just to get him water to drink. If you are in your flood age, you should prepare disciples when things are going very smoothly. Are you preparing for those days when the flood will be gone? What arrangements are you making during your daytime because the night is coming? I am speaking in proverbs, but a word is enough for the wise.",

      "Two days ago, I discussed the prime of a man, the time when things are at their brightest, and I said that it is possible for someone to miss his flood. What should a fellow do if he or she has missed his or her flood? If a person has not made good use of his or her flood period, is there any way out before the night falls? If God is keenly interested in such a fellow, He will assist him or her to do one or two things that will turn the situation around.<br>Esau missed his flood when he sold his birthright. When the time came to get the generational blessing, he missed that one too. Genesis 27:34 says that He wept bitterly. Esau repented and cried to his father, saying, “Can't I get just a leftover blessing?” God saw that his repentance was genuine and that his request for just a little bit of blessing was a passionate cry. As God is rich in mercy, He gave him the grace to recover some of the lost grounds. After Esau left his father, he made up his mind to make the best of the little blessing he got from him and prove everybody wrong. By the time we get to Genesis 32:3-7, Jacob sent some animals as gifts through some servants to tell Esau that he was coming home. Those people returned to tell Jacob that Esau was coming with 400 bodyguards to meet him, and the Bible recorded that Jacob trembled with fear. The one who got the original blessing trembled when the one who got the leftover approached him. By the time we get to Genesis 33:1-9, when they finally met, Esau asked Jacob why he sent all those animals and told him that he already had enough. Esau was so blessed that he asked Jacob to keep his possessions. He was indirectly saying, “I might have missed my flood, but as long as I am still breathing, I can still work my way to the top.”<br>You might have also missed your flood, but as long as you are still breathing, it is not too late. You can work your way to the top if you are determined to do so with God's help.<br>Don't give up on yourself. There are people who became successful in their old age. They may be few, but you can be one of the few. What you need is an undying determination and the grace of God.",

For example, we had quite a good bargain when we purchased the first four acres of land that has now expanded to become Redemption City. As time went by, we kept buying more land even though the price was increasing. After we had bought about a thousand acres, some people spoke to me and said, “Why are you buying lands in this bush? There are other things to spend money on,” and I listened to them. However, one night, God said to me, “Son, who called you? These people or Myself? Who promised you a city instead of a boy's quarters?”. I woke up and made up my mind to keep buying more land, but by then, what used to be N1,000 had gone up to N50,000. Today, we have over 40,000 hectres, and we are still buying more. If you are moving in the opposite direction of God's will for your life, God will step in today and bring you back to the right path, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;<br>A fellow might have done something terrible in the past which made it impossible for him or her to reach some goals. An individual can commit a crime and end up with a life sentence. Even though that fellow's case may seem hopeless, God can step in and turn things around.<br>In Genesis 49:1-7, Jacob, on his deathbed, cursed Levi because of some sins from his past, but God stepped in and gave Levi an opportunity to be restored. In Exodus 32:25-26, Moses returned from the mountain and found out that the children of Israel were dancing naked before an idol. He cried out, “Who is on the side of the Lord? Let him come to me.” Everyone belonging to the tribe of Levi crossed over to Moses and became his army. God looked down from heaven and said, “That curse on you is cancelled!” Levi missed it earlier, but he got on God's side and was restored.<br>God can step in to give you hope again. I however have some questions for you: are you on the Lord's side? Do you do His will? Are you committed to serving Him alone?

      "Our Bible reading for today says that elders should behave right in order to influence the younger ones to also behave right – this is how it should be. Beyond words, the younger generation learns more by observing. Besides hearing the things you say, they can also see the things you do. If you want them to behave rightly, let them see you do what you are asking them to do consistently first.<br>When you lie to get a favour for your child in school, and then turn around to tell that child not to lie to you, you are deceiving yourself. If they hardly see you pray and read your Bible, you can't turn around and ask them to read their Bibles. You should be bold to say to the younger ones like Apostle Paul said: <br><strong><em>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. -Philippians 4:9</em></strong><br>Our memory verse for today says that you must show yourself as a pattern of good works. <br>Many elderly people usually say that in order to catch the youths, they need to dress like youths and use their slangs. What they don't know is that when they start looking and talking like them, they are endorsing their lifestyle and some of their negative actions. They can't change them that way, rather, they will only reinforce their negative behaviour. Instead, they should be a standard for the youths to follow. More often than not, the youths know the truth and when they do the wrong things, they actually expect the elders to correct them. Now, imagine their confusion when they see their elders doing the same things they want to be corrected about. In Yorubaland, where I come from, we call elderly people who behave childishly 'agbaya', meaning 'shameless old fellow'.<br>God is counting on elders to guide the younger ones on how to behave for them to have a better tomorrow. God also expects the youths to submit to their elders in humility. Finally, Titus 2:2 says that elders should be sober, brave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity and in patience. As an elder, let this be your watchword. Don't be an agbaya.",

      "Prayer is a very powerful tool given to us by God for regular communication with Him. As powerful as this tool is, it is rather unfortunate that many people don't use it at all while some who do, fail to make the best of it. <br>The first thing that must be in place for you to pray effectively is focus; all distractions must be done away with. The devil knows that you need to be completely focused to get the best out of your prayer time, and this is why you usually remember some not-too-important things that can distract you during prayers. One of the reasons you see many men of God praying when everyone is asleep is that they don't want to be distracted. In Mark 1:35, Jesus Christ woke up before daybreak to pray while others were asleep. He went to a secluded place to pray. You must try to remove distractions. Find a secluded place where you can always go to pray. That secluded place could be your closet or any other place without distractions.<br>Anyone who does not regularly go to a secluded place to pray will eventually grow cold spiritually; I am saying this from experience. Many years ago, God pointed my attention to the fact that I was growing cold. He asked me, “When last did you spend quality time in my presence? Do you remember when you used to worship me in your car so much that my presence will fill the car, and you will have to park by the roadside because tears would have filled your eyes?” I responded, “Yes Lord, I remember, but that was before I had a driver. If I worship you that much now and my driver sees tears in my eyes, he will think something is wrong.” He responded, “Oh, it is now my fault that I gave you a driver?” I quickly apologised. That night, I left the house when everyone had slept to pray in the auditorium. The moment I started worshipping, the tears came rolling down. I had been praying all the while, but the major difference was that I had not been going to a secluded place to pray, and that had made me grow cold. Now, I have made it a habit to pray in secluded places, and my fire has increased greatly as a result.",

      "Yesterday, I discussed the importance of being totally focused while praying. Today, I will continue the discussion on how to pray effectively.<br>When you pray, you must note that prayer is not a one-way conversation but a dialogue between you and God. In other words, prayer is not complete when you only talk to God and do not give Him the opportunity to speak back to you. In fact, whenever I pray, and I don't get a response from God, I become worried because I really want to hear what He has to say. Even if his response is a rebuke, at least I know He has heard me. Habakkuk 2:1 says:<br><strong><em>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</em></strong> <br>You are to stand on your watch until you hear what God has to say. It is not just a time to pour out all your complaints, wait to hear from Him too.<br>The reason many people don't hear from God is that they just come to the place of prayer and start making requests. Isaiah 55:6 says that you should call on Him when He is near. You must first draw Him near to you before you call on Him. Psalm 100:4 says:<br><strong><em>Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.</em></strong> <br>The Scripture above means that if you want to go near God, as you enter into His courts, you should come with praises and thanksgiving.<br>In our Bible reading for today, Jesus taught the disciples how to pray. He started with praise, saying, <strong><em>“Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.”</em></strong> It is this praise that gets you into His courts and then gives you an audience with Him. Before you pray, praise God first. For a prayer session of one hour, spend at least 50 minutes praising Him. After you have praised Him sufficiently and He has drawn near to you, you can be sure that He can hear you and that you will receive answers to your prayers.",

      "Today, I will conclude the teachings I began two days ago on how to pray effectively. Many people make the mistake of giving up on their prayers when it appears as if God is not responding. Such people are only cheating themselves when they do that. To really get the desired results from prayers, you have to be persistent. Isaiah 62:7 says:<br><strong><em>And give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. </em></strong><br>You are to give God no rest until He has answered your prayers. Jesus Christ said in John 16:24 that you should ask, then you will receive so that your joy may be full.<br>From our Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ assures you that if you keep knocking on God's door, asking Him for something, He will give it to you. According to Him, even the wicked judge gave the widow what she wanted, how much more the good shepherd. This tells you right away that if you keep praying about that issue, no matter how long it takes, God will answer you. There are prayer points I prayed for 15 years before I got answers. I did not stop after praying for a few weeks. I kept knocking on heaven's doors, telling God, “I will not let you rest until you have answered me,” and He answered me eventually.<br>This is an attitude that you must also imbibe. Some people get angry that God has not answered their prayers after a while and so, they stop praying. God is not your servant that you can command as you please; He is the King of kings. If you want something from a king, you must learn to humble yourself and keep asking until He is ready to give it to you. If you ask for a little while and go away without receiving anything, who would have lost?<br>You or him? You may say, “What if God is not willing to answer my prayer at all?” You have to keep asking Him until He answers you. This is why you must pay attention to hear what He will say when you pray to Him. Don't just keep asking, seek to hear from Him. The Holy Spirit is always available to teach you what prayer points to pray, and if He is the One teaching you how to pray, you can be sure that you are praying right.",

      "The reason Solomon was extremely grateful to God in 2 Chronicles 1:6-12 is that he realised that he didn't deserve to be king. His father was an adulterer and his mother an adulteress. His father was also a murderer who murdered his mother's first husband. How could God pick the fruit of such a union and make him king? Solomon indeed had every reason to be grateful. If you look at your life closely, you will also see that you don't deserve many of the things that God has given to you, including your life. I think you should really give Him thanks.<br>When people see me dancing in agbada at least once a year to praise God in my mother tongue, many of them do not understand. The day I asked God how He could choose the product of a sinful relationship like Solomon to be king, He also asked me, “Is your mother the first wife of your father?” I had no more questions because, based on the circumstances surrounding my birth, I don't deserve to be called to pastor His sheep. I am always grateful to God because to whom much is given, much is required (Luke 12:48). Even the fact that I am here in this world is something to be grateful for. My mom had made up her mind that she wasn't having any more children because she already had as many girls as she wanted and a boy. However, the boy died, and people begged her to give birth again. She agreed, and I was born. Coming from that background, and also considering all the sins I had committed before giving my life to Christ, it is a privilege that God could save a soul like mine and make me a pastor. So, I know why I dance and sing praises to my God.<br>When we say, “Let us thank God,” those who feel that they deserve everything they have don't see the importance. For some of them, they believe God chose them because He had no choice and so, they don't bother. However, for some of us, we know where we are coming from and the things we survived. I grew up amongst scorpions, snakes, and all sorts of wild animals, and was surrounded by witches, wizards, and the rest. For me to have survived in that kind of environment, I cannot keep quiet when it is time to thank God. Will you do the same?",

      "For someone reading this, it is possible that God has promised you many great things in the past, but you have not yet seen those things manifest. This was what happened to Abraham and Sarah. Years before, God had spoken to Abraham, promising him that he will be a father of nations. However, more than 25 years passed and not a single child was born to somebody who was supposed to be the father of nations. Eventually, in Genesis 18, God showed up for him. I pray for you today, God will show up for you and give you that long-awaited miracle, in Jesus' name.<br>I remember when I became the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I did everything I knew in line with the word of God to make the church grow. Every month, I organised a three-day seminar. I taught the Bible, preached, fasted and prayed. People would come for the programmes, and as soon as we finish, they would vanish. When I get to the church the following Sunday, at times, the congregation will even look smaller than what we had before the programmes. One day, some weeks before my birthday in 1986, God ended my barrenness. He asked me, “What do you want for your birthday?” and I said, “I want a miracle for every member of my congregation.” That was the beginning of the Holy Ghost Service. Today, all that you see happening in RCCG is an example of what God can do whenever He decides it is time to fulfil His promise to you. I pray that before the end of this year, everyone will see clearly that God is smiling on you, in Jesus' name.<br>When God makes you a promise, you can rest assured that He will keep His promise. However, many people have missed out on the fulfilment of God's promise due to a lack of faith. If God promises you something and after waiting for a while, you begin to think that God lied to you and won’t fulfil the promise, it may never come to manifestation. Romans 4:20 says that Abraham did not stagger at the promise of God, even after waiting for up to 25 years.<br>God is a promise keeper. However, if you want to see His promises concerning you fulfilled, you must accept Him as your Lord and Saviour, live holy, have faith, and wait patiently on Him.",

      "<strong><em>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 </em></strong><br>The above passage tells us clearly that God wants your spirit, soul, and body to be preserved blameless until His coming. This is opposed to what many people say about God only caring about our spirit and soul, and not our body. God cares about your body, and He wants it to be blameless. He cares about what you wear (1 Timothy 2:9), how you use your body (1 Corinthians 9:27), and if you get a tattoo or not (Leviticus 19:28). He cares as much about your body as He cares about your soul.<br>The truth is, the state of your soul will determine the state of your body. What is inside will show on the outside. Many years ago, I invited some ministers to teach at The Redeemed Christian Bible College. They told the students that I was too legalistic by placing restrictions on how they use their bodies and that God only cares about the soul. By the time I got back to the class, the students had believed the people I invited. I needed to convince them otherwise, so I went to get two oranges. One orange was yellow, and the other was green. I raised both oranges up in the class and asked, “Which of these two oranges is ripe?” They all pointed at the yellow one. I asked again, “How did you know?” They said it was obvious from the outside that it was ripe on the inside. With that, I told them, “If Christ that you claim to have on your inside is not showing on the outside, it is likely that you do not have Christ in the first place.”<br>Whether we like it or not, people look at your outward appearance and make conclusions about Christianity based on what they see you do with your body. If you look like the people of the world, they will believe that you are just like them and that there is nothing special about you. They will not listen to the gospel you are preaching if you are dressed like a harlot or a hooligan. Don't make someone turn away from the gospel because of your outward appearance, keep your body blameless.",

      "<p>Many people who claim to trust God with all their hearts surprisingly depend on their own understanding and attempt to strategise their way through life. The question, however, is, how deep is our understanding? Do we understand as much as God does? You must understand that two captains cannot be in charge of a ship at the same time. It is either you let God take the wheels of your life, or you leave Him out of it. You cannot be in the driver's seat and only remember God anytime you run into trouble; you must trust Him totally and rely on Him for everything. If you are truly a child of God, you must always be led by Him (Romans 8:14).</p><p><br>Trusting God does not start out easy; He will work on you, and as He leads you, He will mould and shape you to become a better person. When you trust God to lead you, everything you touch prospers. Abraham was a man who trusted God completely, and he prospered greatly. He left everything he ever knew for a land that God said He would show him. He left without a plan; he was determined to trust God all the way. Shortly after, he grew so big that he had 318 men who could go to war with him living under his roof (Genesis 14:14). He was so rich that he rejected a king's gift so that the king would not take glory for his prosperity.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you trust someone, you don't ask unnecessary questions. When you board a plane, you trust that the pilot knows what he is doing and that he will take you safely to your destination; you don't ask to see his license or inspect the condition of the plane. If you can trust human beings with your life that much, how much more the Most High God?</p><p><br>I learnt to trust God very early in my Christian walk because my Sunday School teacher taught me that if a son is at the top of a high place and his father asks him to jump, he will not ask questions because he knows that his father will catch him. The moment I learnt that, I began to trust God so much that once He says “Jump,” I jump, knowing that He will catch me. Everything we have achieved in The Redeemed Christian Church of God to date has been purely based on trust. When He says move, I move. No arguments.</p>",

      "<p>To some, eternity seems like a far-off idea that should not be given much thought. However, it is a reality you must not lose sight of. The truth is, everyone will have to ask themselves, where will I spend eternity? God has provided answers to this question in the Bible and has made them plain and accessible because He does not want eternity and the events surrounding it to take anyone unawares. It is therefore surprising that some Christians live in this world without eternity on their minds. Such Christians can be easily spotted from their lifestyles and attitudes toward the things of God. They live as if they will be on earth forever, whereas Hebrews 13:14 says:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>This was not the lifestyle of the heroes of faith. From the things they set their affections on and their confessions, people could tell that they were eternity-minded. Hebrews 11:13-14 tells us that they saw themselves as strangers and pilgrims on earth. Hebrews 11:16 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>What a glorious testimony this is. I desire this for myself, and I pray that you will also have such a testimony, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't let the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches blur your vision of the place Christ has prepared for you. Eternity is real, and where a person spends eternity is determined by the way he or she lives in this present world (Romans 2:3-10). The place Christ has prepared for you is a place where you will no longer die, it is a place of joy and pleasant experiences (Revelation 21:1-7). On the other hand, there is another place where whoever rejects God's grace in Christ will spend eternity. This place was prepared to punish the devil and his demons, but those who live their lives to please the world, their flesh, or the devil will also partake in it (Matthew 25:41). It is a place of everlasting fire and pain. May you not be found there, in Jesus' name. To escape this horrible and eternal torment, give your life to Christ today, and if you have done so, live holy and remain eternity-minded.</p>",

      "<p>Light can be shining brightly outside, but if your eyes have grown dim, it will not matter because you will be unable to experience its brightness. Genesis 27:1 says that Isaac waxed old, and his eyes became dim that he could not see. This tells you that when a person's vision dies, it means old age has set in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Ecclesiastes 12:1-3, when Solomon said, <i><strong>“…those that looked out of the windows be darkened,”</strong></i> that was his way of saying, “When your eyes can no longer see as a result of old age”. So, one of the ways you will know that you are in your old age is when you no longer have visions. Joel 2:28 tells us that you get to an age when visions become replaced with dreams. The right visions drive people to run (Habakkuk 2:2) to ensure that they are fulfilled, while those who dream usually do nothing to bring their dreams to reality.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some years ago, I was talking to three elders who are also my special friends, and I told them that the definition of old age is 'dreamers'. As long as you still have a vision you are pursuing, it means you are not yet old. This is why I sometimes joke that only those who are older than me are elders because I am still pursuing my vision. So, I am still young, even at 82. It is pathetic to see young people who are already old because they have no vision. Yes, they talk about dreams for their future, but they are mere wishes because you don't see them pursuing them at all. When I see such young people, I often think to myself, “Young fellow, where is your vision?”&nbsp;</p><p><br>When a person becomes a dreamer instead of a visioner, then the fellow is old. Such a person's day, which is the time he or she has to spend on the earth, is almost over. The word of God says in Proverbs 29:18, <i><strong>“Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.”</strong></i> In other words, when a person's vision is gone, the fellow is on his or her way out. I believe God is talking to a specific reader of this devotional. You had great visions, but now, you have forgotten about them. Wake up!</p>",

The Bible says that she hunts for precious life. The chief of all fowlers is the devil (1 Peter 5:8).</p><p><br>A fowler uses a snare to entrap prey. I grew up on a farm, and we used to get our meat by trapping animals. In the evenings, we would get traps, dig into the soil, put the traps in the hole, cover them with leaves, and sprinkle soil on the leaves so that everything would look normal. After setting the traps, we would put baits (usually corn) on both sides of the traps and then go to bed. At night, when an animal sees the baits around a trap, it will go close and eat some of the corn. When it sees that nothing happens, it moves forward, eats a little more and then goes on until it finishes all the corn on one side. Since it has eaten all the corn on one side, it ignorantly attempts to cross over to eat the corn on the other side, and suddenly, as it steps on the trap, it snaps shut and catches the animal. By morning, it is in our cooking pot. There are countless people in hell today because they tasted sin and nothing seemed to happen, so they kept sinning until they got caught in the devil's trap.</p><p><br>Many young ladies from good homes who were taught to keep their virginity have ended up badly because they had sex once, and since nothing happened, they continued until they got pregnant, contracted a disease, or became fully immersed in that terrible lifestyle. One thing a trapped animal experiences when the trap snaps shut is great fear. Likewise, one of the signs that a fellow is in trouble is fear.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The one who is caught in the trap of the fowler is called prey. Interestingly, prey sounds like pray. If a Christian does not pray, he or she will become prey. Psalm 91:3 says that the one who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will be delivered from the snare of the fowler. If you don't want to fall into the snare of the fowler, your secret place with your Father must be on fire. If your altar grows cold, you may soon find yourself in the devil's cooking pot. Pray fervently for at least one hour every day, and it will be difficult for you to be the devil's prey.</p>",

      "<p><i><strong>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</strong></i> Isaiah 49:24&nbsp;</p><p><br>According to the word of God, anyone who catches prey with a trap like I described yesterday can legally lay claim to it. There are lawful captives of the enemy. We have tried to cast demons out of people before, and they would say, “You are trespassing because this fellow belongs to us. They walked into our trap.” For example, I once had a student who was on his way to his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) station when he fell sick. The doctor said he was allergic to rice. When they brought him to me, and as l was about to pray for him, the Lord said that he had to make restitution. It turned out his father stole a neighbour’s bicycle to pay his school fees, and the owner placed a curse on the thief. His father died from an allergic reaction to rice, and now the son was on the same path. If that had not been revealed to me, we would have prayed in futility because the boy was a lawful captive.&nbsp;</p><p><br>l told him to buy a bicycle for the man's son because the man was late. Incidentally, when he returned after doing so, I was about to eat rice. He ate my rice, finished it, and nothing happened to him. Another boy was brought to me for prayers because he was barking. This boy had been having sex with their dog in the house. I prayed, but the barking did not stop. I advised the parents to keep bringing him for the Holy Ghost service every month and be hopeful that God will have mercy and deliver the lawful captive from his captor. When a fellow walks into the trap of the enemy after being lured by his or her lust, the devil can lawfully lay a claim on the fellow.</p><p><br>In our Bible reading for today, Apostle James tells us clearly that God does not tempt anyone, but rather, people are tempted by their own lusts, which result in sin and then death eventually. The bait the devil uses does not usually look like death. The bait has three major qualities to make it effective: it is usually attractive to the prey, it is pleasant to the prey’s taste, and it invokes the prey's pride.</p><p><br>I will discuss these qualities in detail in the following days because I believe God that after this study, you will never fall into the devil’s trap.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I promised to discuss the three major qualities that make the devil's baits effective. The first bait the devil ever used was the forbidden fruit. When you read Genesis 3:6, you will see all the qualities of the devil's bait in the fruit. Eve saw that the fruit was pleasant to the eyes. The fowler's bait is usually attractive and difficult to ignore.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil studies a fellow and knows the things that he or she is attracted to. You will hardly see a man commit adultery with a woman he considers ugly. The bait the enemy will use is usually attractive. Don't be fooled by its attractiveness; it has death in it. In Judges 16:4, Samson 'fell in lust' with Delilah and threw all caution to the wind. The devil used his attraction to her to bait him into a trap that eventually destroyed him. There are probably things around you that you are attracted to that are sinful or that may cause you to sin. It is a trap that you should beware of so that you will not become prey to the devil.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If a man is attracted to light-skinned women, the devil will put them all around him as temptations to commit fornication or adultery. If he is attracted to flashy cars, the devil will keep bringing flashy cars his way. If he lets his lust for flashy cars push him to steal, then the devil has caught him. This is why Christians must circumcise their hearts to change their affections.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</strong></i> Colossians 3:2&nbsp;</p><p><br>Do not be too attracted to the things of the world. You must soak yourself in the word of God. Let His word abide in you so much that the only things that are attractive to you are the things that please Him. Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it flows the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23). Beware of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:16). If you discover that things of the world are becoming more attractive to you than the things of God, it means that you are vulnerable to the devil's snare. Declare a fast for yourself, go on a retreat and spend quality time in God's presence till that lust dies.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will discuss the second quality that makes the devil's baits effective. The devil uses baits which are pleasant to the eyes and taste to get people in his trap. For example, Eve considered the forbidden fruit to be pleasant to the eyes and good for food when the devil tempted her with it (Genesis 3:6). Presenting sin as if it is pleasant is an old trick of the devil to trap man, and every believer must be wary of it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If a fellow is controlled by physical senses, he or she becomes vulnerable to the devil's bait. This is why you must be dead to the flesh. When people always want to satisfy their flesh, they will not be able to control their sexual desires, eating habits, and so on.</p><p><br>The very dangerous thing about the devil's bait being pleasant to the taste is that if a fellow tastes it once, it can become difficult to stop, just as I described three days ago. The key to avoiding the bait is not to taste it at all. Yes, it looks attractive, but you must not go near it at all. An African proverb says, \"What you should not eat, you should not sniff.”</p><p><br>Ask anyone who is addicted to something bad, and they will tell you it all started with a taste. Those who masturbate only tasted it once, and when they saw that nothing happened to them, they did it again and again until they found out that they had become addicted. Those who are addicted to alcohol usually start out as casual drinkers before becoming heavy drinkers. When the trap snaps shut and many of these people look back at their lives, they regret the first day they ever tasted the enemy's bait. If a snare is prepared by the fowler and you stay away from the bait, you will not be caught in it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>During the Nigerian civil war, there was a slogan used by one side of the conflict: “The price of safety is unresting vigilance.” Please, my beloved, stay as far away from the devil's bait as you can. If you are addicted to a sinful habit, you need the power of the Most High God to break free from it. Seek help from a spirit-filled man of God and you may also consult a Christian professional counsellor to break free from that addiction.&nbsp;</p><p><br>By the grace of God, you will not become the devil's prey, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will conclude my discussion on the qualities that make the devil's bait effective: the devil ensures that his bait invokes his prey's pride. In Genesis 3:6, Eve ate the forbidden fruit because she felt that it could make her wise. When you are lured to do something to show off, beware!&nbsp;</p><p><br>Usually, the enemy catches people who think that they can never be caught (1 Corinthians 10:12). When a fellow says, “I believe in holiness, and I practise it, so the devil can never get me,” he or she should take heed. For example, in Luke 22:31-34, the Lord said to Peter, “Satan desires to have you.” Peter said, “Lord, even if it involves death, the devil will not overpower me.” Jesus replied, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>In today's Bible reading, we discovered that Samson fell because he was over-confident. Delilah did not hide her intentions, she clearly asked for the secret of his power to know how to overpower him. Samson thought that with his track record, he could not be captured and so, he decided to play a game with the devil. Don't play games with the devil, he has been around for a long while. His track record shows how many great people he has destroyed. 1 Thessalonians 5:22 says, <i><strong>“Abstain from all appearance of evil.” </strong></i>If it looks like evil, don't think that you can withstand it. Run!</p><p><br>I know someone who said that he joined one of the secret cults on his campus because he was curious. He said he did it for fun, believing that he would not get involved in the terrible things they do as if that were possible. Don't joke with the devil. The Bible says in Proverbs 16:18 that pride goes before destruction. Proverbs 29:23 says that a man's pride shall bring him low.</p><p><br>Some years ago, a lady was to be employed as my private secretary, and I said, “No way!” I know the nature of my work; I work day and night. What will I say I am doing alone in my office at night with another man’s wife. Some people came later and said, “Sir, we thought you were anointed.” I said, “I know, but does the anointing turn your body to stone?”&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you think you cannot fall, you are already on your way down because your pride will make you get close to the trap enough for it to eventually catch you. Pride goes before a fall.</p>",

Jeremiah 1:5 illustrates this clearly:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</strong></i></p><p><br>Believe me, the plan that God has for you is a good one. He made that known in Jeremiah 29:11. The question now is, are you walking in line with His plan for you? It is not enough for God to have a good plan for your life; if you refuse to live according to His plan, it will look like there was none in the first place.</p><p><br><i><strong>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</strong></i> Isaiah 30:21</p><p><br>God is willing to guide you in the direction you should go at every point of your life; He is willing to be your compass all through life.

Only those who draw close to God, listen to Him, and obey Him completely will fulfil His plan for their lives.</p><p><br>I thought I was on the right path when I was trying to become the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa. I thought that was a good plan until I met God and drew close to Him. Thereafter, He began to whisper into my ears which way to go at every point. When He told me to leave my job and become the General Overseer of a church whose total monthly income was not up to my salary, that was a hard thing to do – thank God I obeyed. I did not become the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa, but today, many Vice Chancellors call me Daddy. The Redeemed Christian Church of God also owns a university that has been rated as the second overall best in the country. God's plans will always be far greater than anything you can ask or imagine (Ephesians 3:20).</p>",

It is unfortunate that some people in the church today have yielded to the devil's devices and are living a life that is full of hopelessness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Ecclesiastes 1:1-14, we see the richest and wisest king in the world speak with a tone of depression and loss of hope. This tells us that money, power, and all the material things of life cannot give anyone joy and hope. Those who allow the deceitful pleasures of sin to erode the love for God from their hearts will one day look at themselves and feel empty. This was what happened in King Solomon's life as we see in 1 Kings 11:3:</p><p><br><i><strong>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The Bible warns us in Hebrews 3:12 that we should take heed, <i><strong>“…lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.” </strong></i>Solomon departed from God, and his life became empty even though he was a rich king.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>There is no joy or satisfaction in having material wealth and losing your connection with God.</strong></i> Mark 8:36 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&nbsp;</p><p><br>Money and fame cannot give you hope. Only Christ in you can give you hope for a better tomorrow. With Christ, you not only have high hopes for your future here on earth, but you also have an assured future in eternity. If you have Christ, hold on tight to Him because that is the greatest possession you will ever have. 2 Peter 1:3 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>If you have backslidden at one point or the other, do a self examination, identify where it all went wrong, and go to God in genuine repentance. You should also ensure that you seek help from other believers around you. Never be too proud to speak to someone that can help you regain your connection with God. If your heart has been turned away from God, I pray that He will restore your connection with Him and take away every feeling of hopelessness you might be experiencing, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>Many people dwell on their past achievements in the kingdom of God. They talk about the days they were on fire for God, how they used to pray for long hours, and how they used to win souls for God. Currently, however, you cannot see any sign of that same zeal they talk about in them. These are the kind of people we call 'old soldier' where I come from in Nigeria.</p><p><br>An old soldier in this context is someone who used to be very active in the army but who, after a while, became old, unfit and irrelevant. Old soldiers, in this sense, are Christians who used to be very vibrant, win souls for God, heal the sick, and perform many wonders in Jesus' name. However, somehow, they started to lose their zeal and became unfit, so that now, when people are talking about zealous Christians, they hardly mention them. Such Christians have moved from hot to cold in the things of God. If this describes you, then you need to retrace your steps and return to your first love.</p><p><br>You need to go back to the days when you put God's will above your comfort and convenience; the days when the things of this world were not enticing to you and all you cared about was doing the will of God. You need to go back to those days because being an old soldier in the body of Christ is a very dangerous thing. Jesus Christ said in Luke 9:62 that if anyone places his hand on the plough and looks back, he is not fit for the kingdom of God. To God, past glory is gone; what is more relevant to Him is your current spiritual state. In Ezekiel 18:24, He said that if someone has been righteous all his life but turns around and starts sinning, if that fellow dies in sin, he or she will be condemned. As far as God is concerned, the path of the righteous will shine brighter every day until the perfect day – which is the day he sees Jesus in glory.</p><p><br>Like Apostle Paul said in Philippians 3:13, forget those old days of glory and begin to seek God afresh. Make your Bible your best friend more than ever before. Intentionally set out quality time to pray daily. Look for a vibrant fellowship of believers that you can associate with regularly and ensure that your zeal for God's kingdom keeps growing.</p>",

He said in verse 13 that they should cry to the Father, “Lead us not into temptation and in case we have already fallen into trouble, then deliver us from evil.” This part of the Lord's prayer bothered me for a while. Can God really lead someone into temptation? Then I read in Proverbs 22:14:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;This means that when someone is abhorred of God, such a person will be pushed into the mouth of a strange woman so that he can be destroyed completely. You will understand this better when you read 1 Corinthians 3:17:</p><p><br><i><strong>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>So, if you notice that it is becoming very difficult to overcome any temptation, you should go on a retreat for some days and cry to God for mercy. He has promised that He will always make a way of escape for you (1 Corinthians 10:13).</p><p><br>Watch your steps. Don't get yourself into a situation where God will say, “I have had enough of you. Go ahead and do as you like, and we will see the result of your actions.” Have you toyed with sin and said to yourself, “There was no repercussion for the things I did in the past, so all is still okay?” Don't deceive yourself; everything you do on earth is recorded in heaven, even your idle words (Matthew 12:36). If you don't stop, one day, God will open that book and say, “Is this person taking me for a fool? I will show him that I am not a fool and cause him to destroy himself.” May that not be your portion, in Jesus' name.</p><p><br>Now, I know there might be someone reading this now who is still not willing to stop sinning. This is the kind of fellow described in 1 Timothy 4:2.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The truth is, your holiness does not help me in any way; it helps you. I am not asking you to live holy so that I can make it to heaven, I am asking you to live holy so that you will not spend eternity in hell. I have done my duty by bringing this message to you.

      "<p>These days, many people have tried to water down the standards of God because of modernisation. However, the Bible clearly states in 2 Timothy 2:19 that God's foundation stands sure. God said clearly in Malachi 2:16 that He hates divorce. Mark 10:9 also says clearly:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The moment a man and a woman are joined together in holy matrimony, they are no longer two people but one flesh. Just as you cannot decide to cut yourself into two and continue living, a married couple should never be divorced – God hates divorce. They are joined until death separates them. This is why my late Father in the Lord used to say to brothers who were about to get married in the church, “Once you carry her, you have carried her for life.” Luke 16:18 says that if you divorce to marry someone else, you are committing adultery. The court may give you papers of divorce and a new marriage certificate; however, in heaven, you are recognised as an adulterous fellow. If you are married, know this very well, God does not intend for you to ever get divorced; marriage is a lifetime commitment.</p><p><br>Knowing that the moment you are married, you are joined to your spouse for life, you must take extra caution to marry the right person if you are yet to be married. If you have not heard from God with several confirmations, don't get married yet. It is better to be single and make heaven than to be married and have your marriage lead you to hell. Believe me; you will be doing yourself a lot of good if you wait on God to lead you before you get married.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If your marriage is troubled, getting a divorce is not the solution. You have already made a vow before God that you will be with your spouse until death separates both of you, and you must uphold that vow (Ecclesiastes 5:5). Rather than considering divorce, go to God, the One who created the institution of marriage and cry to Him for help. Is there anything too hard for Him to do? (Jeremiah 32:27). The answer is ‘No’, for nothing is impossible for Him to do (Luke 1:37), and this includes providing a solution to the problem in any marriage.</p><p><br>God hates divorce, and if you are truly His child, you will not want to do anything your Father hates.</p>",

You are not allowed to steal as a child of God. Stealing means taking that which does not belong to you without the permission of the owner or using that which is not yours as if it were.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When I was a lecturer, I wrote a personal letter and wanted to use an official envelope. Then, God said, “Don't!”. I replied, “Why not?” He said, “That's for official letters, not personal letters.” I responded, “Lord, how much does an envelope cost?” and He said, “If you know an envelope is that cheap, go and buy yours.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jeremiah 17:11 tells us:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The scripture above is saying that if a person acquires wealth by fraudulent means, it will not last, and the fellow will eventually regret his or her actions. For example, in 2 Kings 5:20-27, Gehazi fraudulently sought to amass material possessions from Naaman but ended up becoming a leper.</p><p><br>Several years ago, I was chairman of a high school's board of governors. I decided to help the school by building a boys' and girls' hostel, a school hall, and the principal's quarters. The principal decided that it was also an opportunity for him to build a small house in his home-town with some of the resources provided for the school's building project. So, as the school buildings were being constructed, he was also building his little mansion. When he finished, somebody surfaced and said, “Who built on my land?” He said, “I bought this land from so and so.” The real landowner replied, “You bought it from the wrong fellow.” The principal said, “Okay, let's not argue, how much do you want for the land?” The man said he was not selling the land and asked him to remove his house. The house is still there today, uninhabited. The landowner didn't bother using the land, he clearly didn't even need it. All the principal's efforts were wasted, and his dreams were dashed because the word of God is clear.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The life of a thief is a terrible one. His days are full of curses, and there is no peace for him at all. Beloved, it is only the blessing of God that comes without adding sorrow (Proverbs 10:22).</p>",

      "<p>Revelation 22:15 tells us that as far as God is concerned, liars and dogs are in the same category. John 8:44 says that the devil is a liar and the father of lies, so, if you tell a lie, you are declaring openly that your father is the devil.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, I travelled to Ilesha and on my way back to Lagos, I decided to visit my late father in the Lord. I was close to his house when I remembered that he had taught us not to visit men of God empty-handed. So, I stopped to buy some oranges in Surulere. As my father in the Lord was eating the oranges, he said, “Wow, these oranges are sweet, did you buy them on the road?” I understood that the road he was asking about was the road between Ilesha and Lagos, not Surulere, however, I said, “Yes sir”. The moment I said so, the Holy Spirit said, “You lied”. I said, “What is the difference? After all, I bought them at the roadside in Surulere.” Again, the Holy Spirit said, “You lied”. I said, “How does it affect the sweetness of the orange?”&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Holy Spirit did not leave me alone, so I said to my Father in the Lord, “Papa, you asked a question just now. I actually bought these oranges in Surulere.” The old man nodded his head and said, “Hmmm, Holy Spirit.” He knew who was dealing with me. This is why it is surprising that many Christians have gotten so used to lying, even in the church. A lying tongue is an abomination to God (Proverbs 12:22). God is irritated by lies, irrespective of where it is told.</p><p><br>If God hates lying lips, it means that the prayers of a liar will be unanswered. God does not want to hear the voice of a liar. This is why many are struggling; the lies they love to tell have become a barrier between them and God. Lying can cut a man's life short. In Acts 5, the man and woman who lied to God's representative fell down and died. This is a warning to every child of God who tells lies. God does not want you to be destroyed. Do not tell lies.</p>",

      "<p><strong>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</strong> 2 Timothy 1:7&nbsp;</p><p>The above passage tells us clearly that the Holy Spirit which God gives to us is not a Spirit of fear. This also implies that fear is not a feeling, but a spirit, and that spirit is not from God. As Christians, whenever we find a spirit that is not of God around us, we must banish such a spirit immediately. Today, fear is banished in your life, in Jesus' name.</p><p><br>The antidote to fear is faith. Ephesians 6:16 says: <strong>“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”</strong> When this Scripture was written, soldiers had to go to war with shields as it was essential for their survival against the attacks of the enemy. Likewise, we are to quench the fiery darts of the enemy with the shield of faith.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What are these fiery darts? They are the imaginations through which the spirit of fear creeps into a man's life. This is why 2 Corinthians 10:5 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The knowledge of Christ casts down fearful thoughts and imaginations. The more of God you know, and the more aware you are of His power and love for you, the less afraid you will be. You must subject every negative thought to the truth of God's word. When the thoughts come, you should respond with the word of God that counters them. As you do this over and over again, you will overcome those fears.&nbsp;</p><p><br>You cannot know God without studying His word, hence, to truly banish fear from your life, you need to study God's word consistently. The Bible says in Romans 10:17:</p><p><i><strong>&nbsp;… faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</strong></i></p><p><br>The more of God's word that you constantly listen to, the more your faith will grow. This will ensure that there is no room for fear in your heart. Study the word of God and meditate on it every day. Memorise His word, especially the portions that speak specifically to the fears you have. As God's word dwells richly in your heart, every form of fear will disappear.</p>",

      "<p>James 1:22-25 tells us that we must not be hearers only, but doers of the word of God. It says that people who are not doers of the word are deceiving themselves and are qualified to be called fools. According to our Bible reading for today, a fool is someone who hears the word and will not act on it. Such a person is like someone who is building a house on sand. Some of the people God called fools according to Psalm 14:1 are those who say that there is no God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If I were to ask many Christians if they believe there is God, they are likely to say 'Sure'. The question is, why then are they careless with His words? Those He calls fools are those who do not take His words seriously. Those who don't obey the word of God do not have the fear of God. Proverbs 1:7 says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. If we all fear the Almighty God, we will not disobey His words. Those who disobey God are fools.</p><p><br>For some people, their ideology is, “I obey when I want, the way I want, and only the part of the word that is convenient for me.” Such people have lost the fear of God. In Matthew 21:28-32, Jesus told the story of a father who said to his son, “Go and work on my farm.” The son replied, “I am not going.” He later repented and went. How can your father give you an instruction, and you tell him to his face, “I am not going?” If you were raised the way I was, some lashes will definitely follow such effrontery. As for the second son, the father also gave him an instruction, and he said he will obey, but he did not obey. Proverbs 25:19 says that such a son is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint; someone who lets you down at a critical moment. However, there was a third son that you may not easily notice in that passage; He was the one telling the story. Jesus Christ Himself was the Son who said, “I will go,” and went (Isaiah 6:8). In Matthew 26:39, this same Son said, <i><strong>“…not as I will, but as thou wilt.”</strong></i></p><p><br>Let your disposition to God's word always be, “Not as I will, but as thou wilt.” My prayer is that you will always do the will of God, just like Jesus Christ.</p>",

Are your hands clean? Are you living holy? The Bible says that if you are not living holy, you are at such a distance from God that He cannot even hear your prayers. Because people who are living in sin are far away from Him, He will not hear them. God hates sin and cannot come close to sin at all. If you want anything from Him, stay away from sin.</p><p><br>Some people feel that they can force God to do things for them. Since they do not want to stop their sinful lifestyles and also know that God will not hear their prayers, they will seek an anointed man of God to pray for them. They believe that God will answer the prayers of the anointed man of God. Several times, I have prayed for people for healing, deliverance, and breakthroughs without results. On several occasions, I have cried to God, “What is going on? This fellow is your child, why are you not answering my prayers?” A lot of times, God will say, “You don't know the whole story.” It doesn't matter how anointed a man of God is, God cannot be compelled to listen to his prayers over sinners.&nbsp;</p><p><br>My Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, used to say that it is what a father has that he will use to take care of his children. If God is your father, He will take care of you with His goodness. However, if your father is the devil, he will take care of you with the evil that surrounds him. If you want the blessings of God, ensure that you surrender your life to Him in totality and live holy. The Bible says that without holiness, no one can see God (Hebrews 12:14), so if you truly want to abide in His presence and experience His abundant goodness, holiness must be your lifestyle.</p>",

      "<p>The most difficult instruction Jesus Christ gave to His disciples is probably what we have in today's memory verse. He wants us to love our enemies if we are to be genuine children of God. What are we to do about this seemingly difficult command? Firstly, you should note that His commands are not grievous (1 John 5:3). Also, when you consider the benefits of being a child of God, you will realise that what the Lord commands is just a little price to pay. Amazed by these benefits, John the Apostle wrote in 1 John 3:1:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>The commandment of the Lord to love your enemies is not just a New Testament doctrine. God commands us to do so because He is love Himself (1 John 4:7). He loved us even when we were in His enemy's camp as sinners (Romans 5:8), and since He has commanded us to be perfect even as He is (Matthew 5:48), it means that we have to be like Him in all things (Ephesians 5:1), even in loving our enemies.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Why is it so important to God that you love your enemies? One reason is that it practically reflects the true nature of your Father, showing Him to be different from what the devil portrays Him to be (Genesis 3:1-5). When unbelievers experience such uncommon love from you, they are convinced beyond reasonable doubt that your God is good. Many people testify that they gave their lives to Christ because of the benevolent acts of Christians. Your perceived enemies today may be your best Christian brothers and sisters tomorrow if only you will heed the Lord's instruction to love them.</p><p><br>Through your love, their wickedness will melt away. One of my relatives, who was an idol worshipper and was well known for his wickedness, decided to follow me to church when he experienced the goodness of the Lord flowing through me into his life. When he was confronted by others as to why he abandoned his deity and foolishly followed me to serve the Lord, he confessed that he was left with no other option but to join me in serving Jesus Christ because of the love I had shown him. He asked those questioning his decision, “Can't you see how my life has been spiritually and materially transformed?”&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, be good to your enemies and never repay them with evil.</p>",

Some students are focused on the teacher's clothes, some on how he talks, others on impressing other students, and so on. What is worthy of note is that those who focus on less important things lose a whole lot in the end.</p><p><br>This same thing plays out in God's kingdom; many Christians do not focus on the right things. All some Christians want from God is a new car, a new house, a promotion and so on. I pity such Christians because they might get what they are focused on but lose out on the more important things they have ignored.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jesus Christ said that you should seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all other things shall be added to you (Matthew 6:33). In other words, if you just focus on making it to heaven by being righteous here on earth, cars, houses and other material things will automatically come your way. I am a living testimony of what Jesus said in this verse of Scripture. I set my focus on the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and now, I can't count how many of these other things I have. The best part is that I am also on my way to heaven.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Why focus on things that are temporary instead of things that are eternal? Focus on the eternal things, and the temporary things will follow. Many people never reach the heights that God has ordained for them because somewhere along the line, they take their focus away from heaven and start pursuing material things. Their prayers change from, “Lord, help me to love You more” to “Lord, give me this and that.” You need to remember that when the roll is called up yonder, none of these things will matter anymore. Ask anyone who has had a near death experience, and they will tell you that material things, as flashy as they may seem, are not worth all the attention given to them. From now on, make Paul's admonition in 2 Corinthians 4:18 your lifestyle:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</i></p>",

Amen.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>How comforting and encouraging this is. No wonder Paul was able to say in Romans 8:31:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;<br>The reason no one can be against you is that the presence of God is always there to chase any kind of danger and shame away from you. It was the Present Help who saved me from the financial embarrassment of not having enough to feed the crowd that came for one of our conventions. My wife came to me asking for additional money to keep feeding the crowd when the convention was just halfway through. I did not have any money, but the Lord showed up in His usual way of proving Himself mighty in my life. He sent people to me who met this need, and in the end, we had more than enough to feed the crowd. Another time, I was almost stranded during one of my trips to a foreign country because my flight was delayed for one day, and I had spent all the money with me. I prayed to the Present Help, and before I went to bed that night, I had more than enough for the rest of my trip.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In today's Bible reading, you are encouraged to be of good courage because God is with you in spite of the enemy's plans to harm you (1 Peter 5:8).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, to enjoy this divine comprehensive insurance, you need to belong to the family of the Present Help. Give your life to Him and make a commitment to love what He loves and hate what He hates. You will begin to experience His presence wherever you go.</p>",

      "<p>In today's memory verse, the Lord reveals Himself as the source of power for prosperity. It is the blessing of the Lord that gives riches without any sorrow (Proverbs 10:22). Those who desire to prosper without sorrow will therefore pay attention to the path of prosperity He has set out in His word. Today's Bible reading also contains truths from God's word that can deliver any soul from the bondage of poverty. Your Father in heaven wants you to prosper greatly, and so, we will examine a few of these truths today.</p><p><br>Firstly, the Lord told the children of Israel that the land He was giving them was being taken care of by Him from heaven. In other words, the land would yield its best to them because He was in charge of it, not because of their own efforts. To emphasize this, the Lord described the land to them further, saying in Deuteronomy 11:12:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Therefore, to prosper in this world, you need to look away from the present economic situation around you and focus on the economy of heaven that is managed all year round by the Almighty Himself.&nbsp;</p><p><br>For the economy of your life to respond to the laws of heaven, you must be subject to the laws of heaven. Many people get excited about God's promises but fail to do their part, therefore, they do not experience the fulfilment of the promises. God gives those who acknowledge Him as their Creator, Redeemer, and Lord the power to prosper. Do you regard God as your Creator? Do you honour Jesus Christ as your Redeemer, or do you take His death for granted by going back to sin even though you have been saved? For God to prosper you, you must honour Him as God indeed. Today, He is asking you the same question He asked the Israelites in Malachi 1:6:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>If you truly desire the power to prosper from God, you must ensure that your life honours Him. You must also ensure that you fear Him and love Him with all your heart, soul and mind (Matthew 22:37).</p>",

      "<p>The joy that comes from knowing God is immeasurable. However, joy is just one of the many benefits enjoyed by those who know Him. From our memory verse, you will understand that those who know their God will be strong and do exploits. As a Christian, you do not have to be fearful about the challenges that come with everyday life. God has empowered you to overcome whatever obstacles you might encounter. The Bible says in Romans 8:37:</p><p><i><strong>…we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</strong></i></p><p><br>Furthermore, knowing Jesus empowers you to walk in victory every day and to be bold in the face of trials (Proverbs 28:1). Fear can paralyse a fellow, but God has not given you the spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Knowing God and understanding His perfect love for you enables you to live above fear. The Bible says in 1 John 4:18:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</strong></i></p><p><br>After his encounter with the Lord, Paul was so full of joy from knowing the true God that he penned the words of today's Bible reading, in which he confessed wholeheartedly that Jesus was everything to him. Even after he had attained great heights in the Lord, he still longed to know Him better because he discovered that the more of Jesus he knew, the more joyful, fulfilled, satisfied and hopeful of eternal life he became. I pray that you will experience this type of joy, in Jesus' name.</p><p><br>Beloved, knowing Jesus increases your faith in Him, and as you increase in faith, you please God more. The Bible says in Hebrews 11:6 that without faith, it is impossible to please God. The joy of having eternal life is drawn from knowing Jesus. John 17:3 says:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</strong></i></p><p><br>To know Jesus is to know peace because He is the Prince of peace (Isaiah 9:6). Knowing Jesus is knowing prosperity and abundance (Matthew 14:14-21, 2 Corinthians 8:9). Knowing Him is knowing divine healing and, better still, divine health (1 Peter 2:24). All these and more are the benefits of knowing our Saviour. Beloved, do you truly know Jesus?</p>",

      "<p>Peter's encounter with Jesus at the Lake of Gennesaret&nbsp;is a pointer to the fact that our Lord is indeed a generous rewarder (Luke 5:1-7).&nbsp;<br>He allowed the Lord to use his boat as a pulpit and was rewarded with such a great catch of fish that his boat began to sink; he had to call additional hands to help him manage his breakthrough.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are many areas of service that attract God's generous rewards. One of such is partnering with God to advance the agenda of heaven; this was what happened in Peter's case. Another act that brings heavenly rewards is obedience to the Lord's instructions. You can see this in the story of Abraham, who obeyed God when he was instructed to get out of his father's house to a place God would show him (Genesis 12:1-4). He obeyed, even though he did not know where he was going. As if that wasn't enough, when he was eventually blessed with Isaac, the child of promise, he was asked to sacrifice him as a burnt offering, and again, he obeyed. As a result of his obedience, God rewarded him with an everlasting covenant of blessing and multiplication (Genesis 22:15- 17).&nbsp;<br><br>Another area of service that receives God's attention for generous rewards is hospitality. An example is the story of the Shunammite woman who was so generous to Prophet Elisha that the Lord rewarded her with a son - a gift money could not buy (2 Kings 4:8-17). The story of the widow of Zarephath is another example of how God rewards hospitality (1 Kings 17:9-16). She sacrificed her last meal and that brought about meals that sustained her family throughout a famine. The Bible says in Hebrews 13:2:</p><p><br><i><strong>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</strong></i></p><p><br>God also rewards people who host His presence in their homes. According to 2 Samuel 6:11-14, God blessed Obed-Edom so much for housing the ark of the covenant that he became the envy of the king. This is a great lesson to those who are reluctant to submit their homes as house fellowship meeting centres. Such people don't know the blessing they are missing out on by denying God the use of their space.&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as today's memory verse declares, our God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek, serve, obey, and honour Him. Use this to your advantage today.</p>",

You will be surprised at the level of unbelief demonstrated by many who claim to be children of God when they are faced with adverse situations. At such times, fear makes many lose their hold of God's infallible word; this is what happened to the disciples in today's Bible reading. They were so afraid of the great storm threatening their lives even though Jesus was right there in the boat with them. At that moment, they forgot all the great deeds they had seen Him do and all the powerful things they had heard Him teach. Think about yourself, how do you react when you are in trouble like the disciples? Do you blame God, or do you act as if He is not even there with you at all? You must always remember that Jesus Christ is with you in the boat of life. Not only is He with you, but He can also feel the turbulence of the boat and will come to your aid once you call on Him. Hebrews 2:18 says of Him:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p>He personally promised to be with you always, even to the end of the world (Matthew 28:19-20).

When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>I must, however, point out that only the redeemed of the Lord can lay claim to His promises in this Scripture. Have you been transformed by the redeeming work of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary? Do you have the assurance of salvation in your heart? If you are genuinely saved, I congratulate you. Nevertheless, our Lord wants you to demonstrate faith in Him by trusting Him in the midst of adversity. It is impossible to please God without having faith in Him (Hebrews 11:6). I, therefore, encourage you with these words of the Master in Mark 11:22 that says:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>…Have faith in God.</strong></i></p>",

In Exodus G8:1, He said to Moses,<i><strong> “…Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.”</strong></i> God's reason for delivering the Israelites from bondage was so that they could serve and worship Him. Likewise, your salvation comes with a purpose, as the passage in today's Bible reading reveals.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Mark 1:40-45, a leper came to Jesus and said, “I know that You can make me clean if You are willing.” Jesus answered, “I am willing.” With one touch, the leper was cleansed, and he went everywhere testifying. God heals so that there can be testimonies. Also, anytime He sets captives free, it is for a purpose. In Mark 5:2-20, the madman of Gadara was delivered and was ready to follow Jesus everywhere, but Christ said No! He had been delivered for a purpose – to be a witness.&nbsp;</p><p>God also sets free for His name to be praised. In Mark 3:1-5, the man with the withered hand received his healing because Psalm 47:1 says, <i><strong>“O clap your hands, all ye people…”</strong></i>. A withered hand cannot be used to clap for God, so his hand was restored.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the purpose of a miracle? The Bible says in Acts 3:1- 11 that when the lame man at the Beautiful Gate received his miracle, he started walking, leaping, and praising God. When you receive a miracle, it is so that you can begin to praise God. Also, miracles lead to the salvation of souls. In Acts 4:4, we see that Peter's speech after healing the lame man led to five thousand people being saved! God does miracles to draw people to Himself.</p><p>In Luke 5:1-11, when Jesus stepped into Peter's boat after he had laboured all night and caught nothing, he received a huge miracle that frightened him. The Lord said, “From now, you will no longer catch fish but men.” Peter got a breakthrough that drew him to serve God because the Bible says that he forsook all and followed Him.&nbsp;</p><p>You should ask yourself, “Why has God delivered me from darkness and kept me healthy? Why did He save my soul?” He did all these for a purpose. Have you discovered that purpose? Don't just thank God for healing, salvation, deliverance, and provision; remember that He did everything for a purpose. You must continually seek to discover His purpose for your life and fulfil it.</p>",

      "<p>Our Bible reading for today tells us that without counsel, purposes are defeated. In other words, if you plan to do something and you don't have any advice, you might not be able to achieve it. Proverbs 20:18 says:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</strong></p><p><br>Getting advice or counsel, as the Bible calls it, is very needful. Do not begin any endeavour without getting good advice. Proverbs 24:6 says, “<i><strong>…in multitude of counsellors there is safety.”</strong></i> When you surround yourself with many good advisers, you will be safe and unlikely to make costly mistakes in life.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that it is not every piece of advice that you should take. God said in Proverbs 8:14 that counsel and sound wisdom are His. Every counsel you take must ultimately be from God, and as such, you should ensure that every bit of advice you receive aligns with the word of God before you accept them. This is because some clever people might come to you with pieces of advice that sound very good but that are ungodly and misleading. God is the best counsellor. In fact, that is one of the names of the Lord Jesus Christ according to Isaiah 9:6.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>Whenever you get advice from anybody, check for what the word of God says concerning it. If you discover that it is not in agreement with the word of God, then you should know that it is not coming from godly wisdom, and you must reject it. This is why you need to know the word of God yourself so that when somebody gives you a bit of advice, you will be able to differentiate if it aligns with the word of God or not. Be like the Berean Christians; always ensure that you search the Scriptures to confirm everything you hear, irrespective of who says it (Acts 17:10-12).&nbsp;</p><p>Seek God's counsel in everything that you do. Study His word and listen to His advice through the mouth of many wise counsellors who are children of God and who understand His word. This way, you will remain on the right path and will not be led astray.&nbsp;</p>",

If the man is wise, he will slow down because the bridge ahead is narrow, and there might be an oncoming vehicle. On the other hand, if he is foolish, he will keep driving at the same speed or even increase the speed of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>God said in Proverbs 4:7 that wisdom is the principal thing. Principal refers to the most important thing. This means that to God, getting wisdom is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible tells us that there are two types of wisdom. The first one comes from fearing God.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: </strong></i>Psalm 111:10&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom begins when the fear of God is established in your life. When you fear God, you won't do anything to annoy Him because you know that He determines your beginning and end. The Bible calls Him a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29); therefore, He is the last person you should offend. Also, if the Consuming Fire is on your side, you have nothing to fear because the word of God says that if God is for you, nobody can be against you (Romans 8:31). Wisdom teaches you to fear God, thus fear Him wherever you go and at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>The second type of wisdom is the wisdom of this world (1 Corinthians 1:20). This wisdom is not from God and is actually foolishness (1 Corinthians 1:18-25). The world does not recognize God, and as such, worldly wisdom is based on human logic and things that the human mind can grasp. With worldly wisdom, some things can be deemed impossible. However, the Bible tells us that with God, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26).</p><p><br>Do not go with the world's wisdom, as it is foolishness before God. Choose to fear God, obey His word, and He will give you wisdom, which is the principal thing that you need to succeed in life. When you embrace godly wisdom, you will be honoured and crowned with God's glory in everything that you do.</p>",

      "<p>In our Bible reading for today, Elisha would not have known about the axe head that fell if the man who lost Iit did not cry out for help. Many times, we need to cry to God until He answers us. There are people who will say that you don't need to open your mouth when you pray. While it is true that God knows everything, even before you cry, if you go through the Bible, you will see many instances where people cried to God. In Psalm 120:1, David said:<i><strong> “In my distress I cried unto the Lord and He heard me.” In Psalm 77:1, the psalmist said, “I cried with my voice,” </strong></i>not “with my heart” as many might suggest, saying that you can close your mouth and cry with your heart.</p><p><br>David said, <i><strong>“I cried with my voice, and He heard me from His holy hill”</strong></i> (Psalm 3:4). I pray for you; whenever you cry unto God, He will hear you, in Jesus’ name. There is, however, one thing that can prevent God from hearing you, and that is sin. The Bible says that if we regard iniquity in our hearts, God will not hear us (Psalm 66:18). However, if a sinner repents and cries to God for mercy, He will hear. In Psalm 34:17, David said: <i><strong>“The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles”.</strong></i> If you are ready to cry to God today, He will deliver you from all your troubles.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I remember when I came to Lagos to work as a lecturer at the University of Lagos way back in 1969, somebody came to me and said, “This is what people do in Lagos – they give money to a prophet so that he will be fasting and praying for them. So, you have to do the same.” I thought to myself, “Ignorant people, the prophet will just take your money and do nothing.” Thank God that we can call on God directly and He will answer us. Isaiah 59:1-2 says:</p><p><i><strong>Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.&nbsp;</strong></i><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You don't have to pay anyone to pray for you. All you need is to have faith in God and live holy; whenever you cry unto Him, He will answer you.</p>",

      "<p>In over 50 years that I have been serving God, I have observed that He always rewards those who give to Him and work for Him. As long as you live a holy life as His child, He will thank you for whatever you do for Him.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some years ago, I was going to Port-Harcourt, a city in Southern Nigeria for a crusade. God told me about a man that I met at the Full Gospel Business Men Fellowship International Conference and said that I should stay in his house. I had only met this man once. I called him and told him what God said, and he shouted and cried in joy. I stayed at his house and grew very fond of his firstborn, who was a very small boy. One day, I was getting ready to go for the crusade when the children arrived from school. I didn't see my little friend, so I asked his father about him, and he told me that he was at the hospital battling for his life. He had ingested some poison while at school. Immediately, I heard God say, “That was why I asked you to stay here.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>God had seen in advance that danger was coming to this man's house and that was why He told me to stay there. I later discovered that this man had told all his colleagues in The Full Gospel Business Men Fellowship that he would pay for all their outreaches for one year. With such a sacrifice, it was not surprising that God decided to protect his home from danger. I went to pray for the boy in the hospital on my way to the crusade that evening. When I got there, the Doctor signalled to me that there was no hope, but I prayed, and by the time I returned, I met him at home because he had been discharged. The boy's father had pledged to give to God, and in turn, God rewarded him by saving his son from death.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God rewards us bountifully whenever we give Him anything from the depth of our hearts. In our Bible reading for today, you will understand that God sees all you do for Him in secret and will reward you in the open. He will never forget anything that you do for Him.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Have you done things for God that will make Him determined to give you a great reward?</p>",

      "<p>God is Love (1 John 4:8), but He is also a consuming fire (Hebrew 12:29). Many people are on His consuming side, but they think they are on His loving side. Don't be deceived by those who tell you that once you are a child of God, you can behave anyhow. They usually say so because the Bible says that grace came through Jesus (John 1:17). However, the Bible did not say that Jesus is grace, because Jesus is far more than grace. He brought grace, but you will never find anywhere in the Bible that says that Jesus is grace.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If Jesus was full of grace alone, John 1:14 would have said 'full of grace' and stopped there, but it went further to add 'truth'. In John 14:6, Jesus said: <i><strong>“I am the way, the truth and life…”. He never said I am grace.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>When many of my children want to be funny, they will draw a caricature of me wearing a bow tie and holding a tambourine. No matter how funny the drawing looks, when people see the bowtie and tambourine, they will know that the drawing was made in reference to me. I am usually seen with a tambourine, but I am not the tambourine. Let us assume that the tambourine makes me smile at you. If I have the tambourine in my hand as I am relating with you and you do something wrong, I can decide to put down the tambourine, stop smiling, and scold you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Titus 2:11-12, the Bible says that grace brought salvation to us, teaching us to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts. When someone is ungodly and embraces worldly lusts in the name of grace, that fellow has rejected the salvation that came by grace and, as such, will see the consuming side of God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, I advise you to be wise; enjoy the grace of God, but don't take it for granted. Even though Jesus Christ is full of grace, if a person takes that grace for granted, He will show the fellow His consuming side. Make up your mind never to frustrate God's grace upon your life (Galatians 2:21). God's grace is meant to help you overcome sin; it is not a licence to dwell in sin.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Do exploits for the kingdom with the grace that God has made available to you through Jesus Christ. Be like Apostle Paul, who said that the grace of God was what made him do all that he did for God (1 Corinthians 15:10).</p>",

You told my father in the Lord that RCCG is going to spread throughout the world, and I believed that it was going to happen in my lifetime.

The Bible says in Luke 4:25-26 that there were many widows in the land, but Elijah was only sent to her. This is because God had chosen to bless her with supernatural provision. Even though God had chosen to bless her, she needed to give something to bring the blessing into manifestation. When Elijah asked for her last meal, she could have said, “You want to take the last meal out of the mouth of a widow and her son? And you call yourself a man of God.” However, she obeyed and brought the meal to Elijah, and from that moment on, lack became a thing of the past in her family.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God is the owner of heaven and earth; He can get whatever He needs without the help of any human being. He said in Psalm 50:10-12 that if He was hungry, He could eat any of the cattle on a thousand hills because they are His. However, as great as He is, He sometimes requests that a man should give Him something. When He does this, it is because He has chosen to bless that man. God could have provided for Elijah in any way; He had been feeding him for months using birds. In 1 Kings 19:4-8, when Elijah was hungry, an angel brought food and water, so when the brook dried up, God could have sent angels to feed him. It was not Elijah that needed help, it was the widow of Zarephath; she was the one in serious need. When God decides to meet your need, I pray that you will not resist His will.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In 2 Kings 4:8-17, you will see the story of the great woman of Shunem. She saw the man of God passing by, and God moved her to invite him to eat. Elisha refused, but the Bible says that she constrained him. Something within her said, “Don't let that man of God go until you have blessed him.” Elisha ate the meal and kept coming back for more. She kept feeding him and even built an apartment for him. Then one day, God put an end to her barrenness when Elisha prayed for her. God prompted her to do the things she did, and although they cost her money, she got what money couldn't buy in return. May you cooperate with God on the day He decides to bless you, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

No one follows Christ without taking up his or her cross. An evangelist might have told you to just give your life to Christ and everything will be beautiful. That is true, everything in your life will indeed be more beautiful because you have given your life to Christ. However, there will still be some suffering. Jesus Christ said that when we come to Him, He will take our heavy yokes from us, but He never said that He will leave us without a yoke. Rather, in Matthew 11:29-30, He said:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Jesus said that He will give us His own yoke to carry. His yoke is lighter than the one we were carrying before we got born again, but it is still a yoke.&nbsp;<br>The reason many people fall when temptations come is that they were not prepared to suffer for Christ. You must be so determined to follow Christ that you literally say, “If I perish, I perish!” (Esther 4:16). When you do this, your strength will be great, and you will not faint in the day of adversity (Proverbs 24:10). Those that do not faint in the day of adversity always enjoy great benefits when the adversity is over.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Genesis 39, after all that Joseph had gone through in the hands of his brothers, the biggest test of his life came; the wife of his master wanted him to lay with her. He said, “How can I do this thing and sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9). He was willing to face whatever consequence will come with Him following and obeying God. He went to jail, but as soon as God saw that he carried His yoke willingly, He arranged for him to meet Pharaoh, and by the time we get to Genesis 41, he had become the Prime Minister of the greatest nation on earth at that time.&nbsp;<br>Your destiny depends on the answer to this question: are you ready to suffer for Christ?</p>",

When you do this, everyone will see you as wise because you will excel in everything that you do and be above your peers who do not know the truth.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil is the father of lies (John 8:44); he will try to lie to you and twist the truth every now and then. This is why you must know the truth so you won't fall for his tricks. In Genesis 3:5, he suggested to Eve that she was not yet like God even though Genesis 1:27 says that she was made in His image and likeness. Eve ate the forbidden fruit because she did not really know the truth. In Matthew 4:3, the devil told Jesus to turn stone into bread if He was really the Son of God. Jesus did not fall for that because He was sure that He is the Son of God. If you don't really know the truth, the devil will deceive you, and once he does that, your belt of truth, which holds all your other armour in place, will be gone, making you vulnerable to attacks from the enemy.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't expect the devil to come with a black cloth and horns on his head; sometimes, he disguises himself like an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). He can tell you that the grace of God covers all sins and that you can keep sinning and still go to heaven. He can come up with logical reasons to tell you that God doesn't exist or that He is wicked and doesn't love you. These are lies that the devil has used to strip people of their belt of truth in the past. Don't fall for his tricks.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I started a discussion on the full armour of God. Today, I will be discussing the breastplate of righteousness. The breastplate of righteousness is the piece of armour that protects your heart. To be righteous is to always do the right thing according to God's standards. When you are righteous, your heart is protected against the tricks of the devil. The moment you stop being righteous, you expose your heart to all manners of sin in the world, and this is how backsliding starts. The devil is after your heart; this is why Proverbs 4:23 says:</p><p>&nbsp;<i><strong>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The devil wants to turn your heart away from God, so he suggests sin to you every now and then. However, if your breastplate of righteousness is intact, you will not fall. The devil will present something that does not seem really bad to you. I have always said it, if it is not really bad, it is already bad; stay away from it. If you do that which does not really seem bad, you have opened up your heart to accommodate even more sin. Before you realise it, you will start doing things that you said you would never do again; this is how believers backslide.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Is the devil already presenting something that does not seem really bad to you, and you are already making up an excuse for yourself to do it? Desist from that thing immediately; his plan is to get you to remove your breastplate of righteousness so that your heart can become open for his attacks. If a Christian's breastplate is off and the devil attacks his or her heart, it is instant death. Removing every form of carnality from your life is the only way to keep your breastplate of righteousness on.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Your thoughts should dwell on spiritual things (Philippians 4:8). If your mind is drawn to carnal things rather than spiritual things, you are in a dangerous state, but when your mind is drawn to spiritual things, the temptations to be unrighteous will become less effective on you. This is why Romans 8:6 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Beloved, don't let the little things of this world open you up to spiritual death. If something seems bad, stay away because it will only lead to spiritual death.</p>",

      "<p>In continuation of my teaching on the full armour of God, I will be discussing the third piece of armour listed in Ephesians 6:10-17. This armour is actually called the 'shoes of the preparation of the gospel of peace'. The first thing to note about this armour is that it implies moving around with the gospel. Your security is in your preaching of the gospel. The more unbelievers you are able to convert to Christianity, the lesser the devil's attacks on you will be. Ecclesiastes 4:12 says that two are better than one, and a threefold cord is not easily broken. When you are the only Christian in your neighbourhood or family, you are more open to attacks because everyone around you is in the opponent's army. However, if you win all your family members and neighbours to Christ, you will be more secure. When the enemy tries to strike, you will have soldiers around you to come together to pray and send the devil packing. When you are feeling weak spiritually, you will have brethren to strengthen your weak hands and lift your feeble knees (Isaiah 35:3-4).&nbsp;</p><p><br>The peace element in these shoes will give you peace as you go around preaching the gospel. The devil will come at you with all kinds of things to scare you so that you will not preach the gospel, but when you have peace, his tricks will not work on you. He is like a roaring lion (1 Peter 5:8) that scares people but cannot bite. That peace is necessary as you go out to preach the gospel because you will face persecution. Also, as you preach the gospel, you are to bring peace to chaotic environments. This is why in Luke 10:5, when Jesus sent His disciples out to preach the gospel, He said that the first thing they were to say when they got to a new place is, “Peace be unto this house.” What you are spreading is peace, not chaos, and for anyone that receives the gospel, the first thing they will experience in their heart is peace.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, do you have your shoes of the gospel of peace? Do you win souls? Imagine how much peace will be in your country if one of the souls you have won becomes the president of your country tomorrow. When you preach the gospel, you are doing it for your own security</p>",

    bodyText:
      "<p>Over the past few days, I have been teaching on the full armour of God. The shield of faith ensures that the fiery arrows of the devil do not get to you. This suggests that there will be times when the devil will try to attack your health, finances, marriage and so on. You should use the shield of faith to ward off all such attacks. A Christian without faith is vulnerable to the devil's attacks. Also, a Christian without faith should not expect to receive anything from God as we see in James 1:6-7.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some things will come up that will try to shake your faith, those are the fiery darts of the enemy. They will look scary and seem to be able to bring you down, but if you hold on to your faith in Christ, you will ward them off. Sometimes, they come as mountains standing in your way. You must command those mountains to be removed by faith, and they will be removed.&nbsp;<br>One interesting thing about the shield of faith is that it can be in different sizes. In Matthew 8:26, the Bible talks of little faith and then we have great faith in Matthew 8:10. The size of your faith will determine how many fiery darts you can ward off. This is why Proverbs 24:10 says:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.&nbsp;</strong></i><br>&nbsp;</p><p>In order not to faint in the day of adversity, you must build up your faith before adversity comes. Jude 1:20 says that you should build up your faith by praying in the Holy Ghost. Ensure that you pray in the Holy Ghost every day. In fact, pray in the Spirit every minute, after all, that is the only way you can really pray without ceasing as instructed in 1 Thessalonians 5:17.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Faith also comes by hearing the word of God as we see in Romans 10:17. If you want your faith to grow, you must ensure that you study your Bible every day. Also, ensure that you listen to sermons from genuine men of God regularly; this will further help your faith grow.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>One final way through which your faith can grow is through trials as the Bible says in 1 Peter 1:7. Although, many Christians do not want to face challenges, the Bible says that you should count it all joy when you face temptations as they help you become perfect in Christ (James 1:2-4).</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my teaching on the full armour of God by discussing the helmet of salvation. A helmet is a piece of armour that covers the head. Your head is a part of your body that can be used to identify you, as evidenced by the snapshots used in identification cards. Wearing the helmet of salvation identifies you as a child of God and tells the devil to take his hands off you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It is unfortunate, however, that many believers remove their helmet of salvation when they get to certain circles; they don't want people there to know that they are saved. They try to conform to the world rather than being different. Romans 12:2 says:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>When a Christian refuses to identify as a child of God, that Christian is removing the protection from his or her head, and that is one delicate part of the body that will result in instant death if it is struck. Many people lose their salvation because they are trying to conform to the world. Keep your salvation intact by boldly identifying as a child of God everywhere you go.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The blood of Jesus, which was shed on the cross, is what gives us the gift of salvation. Those that are saved are of the light and not of the darkness, as seen in today's Bible reading. Hence, you must behave as a child of light at all times. Matthew 7:16 says that you can identify those who are saved by their fruits. If you start exhibiting fruits that are not of God, your helmet of salvation is off, and that spells trouble because on the last day, when Jesus comes back to take His own to be with Him, He will only take those who still have their helmets of salvation on. This is why you must work out your salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12). Don't assume that you still have your helmet of salvation on just because you have been going to church or even because you are a pastor. Check your salvation at all times to be sure that you are still standing. 1 Corinthians 10:12 says that you should take heed if you think you are standing, lest you fall.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will be concluding my teaching on the full armour of God by looking at the last piece of armour. The sword of the Spirit is the only primarily offensive weapon listed in Ephesians 6:10- 17. It is clearly a very important weapon that every soldier of Christ must have. The sword of the Spirit is the word of God. In the spirit realm, battles are not fought with physical weapons but with words. The most potent of all the weapons used in spiritual battles is the word of God. The word of God is a powerful sword in the mouth of a believer. With it, you can defeat any force in any realm. Hebrews 4:12 describes this sword as quick, powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword.&nbsp;</p><p><br>This weapon is available to you for spiritual battles. When you know how to use this weapon, no force can withstand you. This is why you need to know the word of God for yourself and memorise it. Any Christian that does not study the Bible will be powerless in spiritual matters. When the devil tries to attack your health, counter-attack him with 1 Peter 2:24 that says that you were healed by the stripes of Jesus. When he tries to attack your finances, tell him that the Lord will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19). If he tries to come against your children, tell him that children are the heritage of the Lord so he should get his hands off God's property (Psalm 127:3).&nbsp;</p><p><br>The word of God is superior to any other word, so when you present it concerning any case, the devil has no choice but to give in. If you present your own words to the devil in a spiritual battle, he can ignore whatever you have to say. However, he cannot ignore the word of God. Psalm 138:2 says that God exalts His word above His name. Know the word of God and memorise it so that when you are faced with an adverse situation, you will have the weapons to use to conquer the devil.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't suffer in the hands of the devil when you already have in your possession the sword of the Spirit – a weapon that is guaranteed to defeat him at all times.</p>",

And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

As Moses bent to pick up the snake, his hands touched the holy ground, and from that day, they became anointed. Every ground is ordinary ground until God touches it. When God touches a ground and your hand touches that ground, that hand can never remain the same.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In 2 Kings 2:9-15, when the horses and chariots of fire came to pick Elijah, they swept the ground and took him away. Elijah dropped his mantle, and when Elisha bent down to pick it, his hand touched the same ground that the host of heaven had touched and became anointed. When you study the ministry of Elisha, you will discover that he only used Elijah's mantle once – to cross the Jordan. He didn't use the mantle when he healed the waters in 2 Kings 2:20- 22, neither did he use it when an axehead fell into a river in 2 Kings 6:1-7. The power was in the hand that touched the ground where the holy chariot of God swept. In Acts 26:13, when the light of God shone on the road to Damascus, the Bible says that it was brighter than the noonday sun. That was the light of the Bright and Morning Star. When He came all the way down to earth, Saul of Tarsus didn't just touch the ground, he fell on it. This is why handkerchiefs that had touched his hands and aprons that he had worn worked miracles.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't joke with any ground that is holy.

However, being exposed to higher voltages can be fatal. You must be ready to pay the price if you want to operate in higher levels of the anointing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many years ago, we were at a crusade ground and had been conducting deliverance on one fellow for hours. When the demon wasn't leaving, we had to call my father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, from his prayer room. He came out, commanded the demon to leave in the name of Jesus, and the demon left. I was shocked. I thought I was anointed, but then I saw another level of the anointing. I became determined to grow in the anointing. Some years after that, we were holding a crusade, and while the Bible Study was going on, I went around, making sure everything was going well. At a point, I saw some brethren rolling up their sleeves to cast a demon out of a boy. They saw me and said, “Senior bro is here, let him join us.” I told them that I would pray with them on one condition – that they would allow me to pray first. After they agreed, I closed my eyes and prayed a simple prayer, commanding the demon to leave in Jesus' name. After the prayer, I immediately took my leave, and they were all surprised. Some weeks later, I was passing through the town where we held the crusade and decided to stop by to visit a friend. On getting to his house, I met the boy that was demon-possessed. Before then, he could not go near fire because the demon would push him into the fire. However, to prove to me that he was now free, he cooked me a meal.&nbsp;</p><p><br>No matter the level of the anointing you are operating now, there is a higher level that you must aim to attain. It is good that you can pray to raise the dead, but it will be better if you can wave your hands towards a handkerchief and then that handkerchief is used to raise the dead. To attain greater degrees of the anointing, do what Jesus said in our Bible reading for today: fast and pray often. The more you fast and pray, the higher your ranking will be in the Spirit realm and the more anointed you will become.</p>",

Unfortunately, these days, most people are after getting material things from their fathers and hardly think of what they can do to make their fathers bless them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One day, I had just returned from a journey, and two of my spiritual children came to welcome me. The one who got to me first merely greeted me, the other followed suit when he joined us and then proceeded to collect my bags. Immediately he did that, I said to him, “God bless you.” The first son said, “Daddy, you did not say 'God bless you' to me.” I responded, “What did you do for me? You saw me carrying these bags, but you didn't help me.” If you want your father to bless you, you must be ready to do something that will provoke him to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One very important thing about a father’s blessing is that it is irreversible. Even though Isaac realised that he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau, he could not reverse it (Genesis 27:33). This is why you must seek your father's blessing in every way you can.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Once your father blesses you, you are blessed forever. Nevertheless, blessings are different.

When Isaac wanted to bless Esau, he told him to prepare his favourite meal so that after he had eaten it, he could bless him from deep within his soul (Genesis 27:4).&nbsp;</p><p><br>A father can bless three of his children, but one will still be greater than the rest because the father loves that one in a special way. How well does your father love you? Do you often provoke him to pray for you or are you the type that provokes him to anger regularly? Some people hardly send money to their old parents, some hardly call them, while some others don't even visit them. They may be old and frail now, but their blessings and curses remain very powerful. Whatever you do, ensure that you get as many blessings as possible from your father before he dies.</p>",

      "<p>A major danger in this generation is that parents are so busy with work that they neglect their children. It is absolutely wrong for domestic helps or nannies to spend more time with children than their parents. 1 Corinthians 15:33 says that evil communication corrupts good manners. Whomever children communicate with the most is whom they learn from the most. If you are a parent, you owe it to God to raise the children He has given you and not hand that responsibility over to someone else.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Nowadays, it is almost as if couples are competing with each other on who makes the most money. So, while men are out working, women are also working, leaving children without proper care. Fathers and mothers must both be available to raise the children that God has given to them. Psalm 127:3 says that children are God's heritage; in other words, when you leave this world, what God expects you to leave behind for Him are the children that He has brought under your care, and this is not limited to your biological children. Parents are only caretakers, and if they damage what has been placed under their care, they will pay dearly for it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There were times I wanted to play football with my peers as a little boy, but thank God my mother was always home to send me inside the house to study my books. I thought she was being mean, but she built in me the ability to ignore distractions and focus on my goals. The fear of my father's punishments also put me in check while growing up. My elder brother was quite strong, but the day I saw him crying when my father disciplined him, I determined never to do anything that will make my father discipline me.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some children develop bad habits right under their parents' roof. However, the parents only get to find out several years later, and at that time, it takes only the grace of God for them to change. If you are a parent, don't be too busy to train the children that God has given you. When you leave this world, the cars you drove and houses you bought will not matter; what will matter are the children you left behind. There is an African adage that says, 'If you refuse to build your child because you are building a house, the child you did not build will sell the house you built.' As a parent, the children God has given to you must be your priority, not material possessions.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I started discussing the importance of spending time with children. As parents spend time with their children, they must also spend time with what and whom their children spend time with. Parents should check the apps on their children's phones to see what they are being exposed to. When they are watching movies or cartoons, they should watch with them to be sure that they are safe for them. They should check the websites they visit and ask them to invite their friends over so they can know the kind of friends they keep. They should visit their schools regularly to know the kind of people their teachers are. Parents should not see anything their children are involved in as too low or immature for them. Whatever or whomever children spend their time with will influence them, and parents must be there to ensure that they are influenced correctly. Solomon, in today's Bible reading, spoke to his son about the people he should interact with. He knew that even after raising him the right way, other people and things could still influence him negatively.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are things parents teach their children that the world will try to convince them to compromise on. Today's memory verse tells us not to be ignorant of the enemy's devices. Parents must pay attention to whatever their children are paying attention to. It will be unwise to teach them and then leave them to the world to corrupt them. Beyond that, parents should occupy their children with godly activities so that they can have things to spend their energy on. They should encourage them to join the workforce in their local assembly as well as Christian book clubs and associations. School activities and excursions are good, but parents must also prioritise spiritual engagements for their children. They shouldn't ignore their children's spiritual growth, but rather, they should teach them to build a connection with the Holy Spirit so that they can hear His voice telling them what and what not to do, even in their absence.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are a parent, engage your children in conversations to know what they have in their hearts and the things that influence them. Matthew 15:11 says that it is what comes out of a person's mouth that defiles him or her. Talk to them about anything and everything to hear what they will say and know what is in their hearts.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I pray that you will not fail God over your children, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my teaching on the importance Tof spending time with children. Many ministers of God make the mistake of putting their ministries before their families – this is not how God wants it. Today's Bible reading tells us that a man must first have his house in order before he takes up leadership in ministry. As far as God is concerned, your home must come first, then your ministry next. If your home is not in order, you have no business being in ministry.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are a minister, don't neglect your family because you are helping to build other families. There are many ministers' children who have serious issues that need attention while their parents are helping other children settle theirs – this is wrong. Do not ignore your children because you believe that you are already teaching them the word of God during family devotions and church services. Your children don't see you only as a minister, they also need you to listen to them every now and then as their parent. When you are with them, don't talk as a minister, talk as their parent, showing them love and care. The reason many ministers' children become wayward is that they are living with a minister, not their parent. Make the work of ministry something they enjoy and not something they detest because it takes their parents away from them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I realised that I needed to be with my children during festive seasons, and as such, even when we had church programmes at those times, I always ensured that they came along with me. On our way to such programmes, I would share jokes and riddles with them so that they would have fun and be relaxed. Whenever we arrived at the venue of the programmes, wherever I sleep is where they would also sleep. Even when things were quite tough and all I had to sleep on was a wooden bench, we would all sleep on it together. So, rather than see the programmes as things that took their father away from home during holidays, they became times of bonding and adventure for us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you are praying for great exploits in ministry, remember to pray for your family too. Put them first in the place of prayers. What you pray about shows what you prioritise</p>",

      "<p>I was invited by a chief several years ago to pray for him because he was sick. I asked if he was born again, and he said, “Yes”. This made me happy, and I assured him that he will get well. I prayed, but nothing happened. I sent two of my prayer champions to his house to stay there; they fasted and prayed for him for seven days. Still, the man got worse. Then, I decided to fast and pray for 21 days for the man. That was when God spoke, “Son, it is good to fast, but if it is for this man, he will not get well.” I responded, “But this man said he is your son, why don’t you want to heal him?” Then He told me to ask the chief seven questions. The next time I went to visit him, I said, “Chief, God told me to ask you some questions.” He told me to go ahead and ask. Before I finished asking all the questions, he knew that his secrets had been exposed. I thought he would repent so we could pray together for God to heal him, but he told me never to visit him again. Is there anything that you think has been hidden away that you don’t want anyone to find out about? The word of God says in Luke 8:17:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>God knows the secret sins that individuals might have, and if they refuse to confess and repent of them, He can decide to reveal them in such a way that they will be disgraced.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The fact that sin is hidden does not mean that its consequences are also hidden. The word of God is clear, whatsoever you sow, you will reap (Galatians 6:7). Proverbs 11:21 says that no sinner will go unpunished. If you are hiding any sins, my advice to you is that you confess them to God and repent of them immediately to avoid their consequences. We have a great promise from God that if we confess our sins and forsake them, He will forgive us (1 John 1:9, Proverbs 28:13). If you have secret sins, you have a choice today to either continue in them and suffer their consequences or confess and forsake them so you can have God’s mercy. Choose wisely.</p>",

Death sees you dealing with other enemies and stays aside, waiting until the last moment to pounce. There is no way we can dodge death. Hebrews 9:27 says that it is appointed unto men to die once, so, we are all going to die. Kings, presidents, pastors and General Overseers will all die. As anointed as Elisha was, he still died.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Fortunately, Jesus Christ has defeated man's last enemy. In 1 Corinthians 15:41-57, the Bible makes it clear that death has been swallowed up in victory. If you are a bride of Jesus Christ and you are committed to serving God in Spirit and in truth, death is merely a horse that will transport you to your glorious home above. Those who are not born again should be afraid of death because while death leads Christians to heaven, it leads sinners to the second death.&nbsp;</p><p><br>After a sinner has died on earth, he is judged and sent to hell fire (Psalm 9:17).

Those whose names are not found in the book of life will also be cast into the lake of fire with the devil and his agents (Revelation 20:14-15, Revelation 21:8) – this is the second death. This is the death that you should do everything not to experience. Everyone who dies the second death will be condemned to a lake where fire and brimstone will burn them forever. They will be neighbours with the devil and his demons. If you have seen how terrible a demon looks, you wouldn't want to be in a place with millions of them around you for eternity.

Everyone should aim to be raptured when Jesus Christ comes to take His saints. Those that are left behind after the rapture have a very small chance of making it to heaven, so it will be foolish to risk missing the rapture. The first resurrection is the last chance that will be given to those who miss the rapture.&nbsp;</p><p><br>After the rapture has taken place and the antichrist has taken rulership over the earth, he will bring up a policy that will mandate everyone on earth to worship the beast and take the mark of the beast. The book of Revelation is written in codes, therefore, do not assume that worshipping the beast means that a beast will be on a throne and people will be compelled to bow to it. This basically means that everyone will be forced to obey the beast. I pray that you will not be on earth to experience that, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There will be some people who will miss the rapture and who will be determined not to worship the beast or take his mark. It will be really tough for them because the antichrist will do everything possible to break them. They will be tortured in every way possible – emotionally, financially, physically, and so on. Worse still, almost everyone in the world will be worshipping the beast, and so they will be loners in a very perverse world. There will be no church meetings and gatherings because almost everyone in the church will have been raptured. There will be no pastor to encourage them and no brother or sister to strengthen them; it will be just them against the world and the government – it will be very tough. Many of the people who determine not to worship the beast will eventually yield and end up in hell. Those who stand their ground will be beheaded by the antichrist. However, when Jesus comes back with his saints to defeat the devil, He will give them another chance to be judged, and they will join Him to reign over the earth for a thousand years.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, surrender your life to Jesus Christ if you haven't and commit to living holy for the rest of your life so that when your time is up here on earth or when Jesus returns, you will be with Him without having to experience the ordeal of the first resurrection.</p>",

According to National Geographic, there are between 50 billion and 430 billion birds in the world. Clearly, there will be enough birds to eat the flesh of those who dare to fight God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>While those who died without the mark of the beast are raised up to reign with Christ for a thousand years, those who died while fighting Christ and His army will not be raised until the millennial reign is over (Revelation 20:5). After the armies have been destroyed, there will still be some people who are not soldiers but who have taken the mark of the beast on earth. These are the people that the saints will reign over for a thousand years. After the millennial reign, the devil will be released from his prison, and he will gather a great army to fight the saints. However, this time, the saints will not need to fight because God will send fire from heaven to devour their enemies. Revelation 20:7-9 says:&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

The Scriptures give us a hint in our Bible reading for today.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The mark of the beast can actually take different forms; it can be a mark, a name, or the number of a name. Whichever one it is, it is a representation of the beast, and whoever receives it on his forehead or right hand will be identified as a worshipper of the beast. Only such people will be allowed to buy, sell, or be a part of the society after the rapture has taken place. Anyone who refuses to get the mark of the beast will be hunted and killed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Now, what really could this mark be? In the days of Apostle John, there was no technology, so he could only describe everything that he saw in his vision with the things he had seen around him. A mark that is taken on the forehead or right hand must have been imprinted by a machine, and the imprint must be something that cannot be washed off. The reason tattoos seem permanent is that they are printed on the skin. However, they become blurred over time and can even be erased with laser surgery. Since this mark is one that is so important to people's identity and life, it will not be one that can fade or be erased. This means that it will go really deep into the skin. It is likely to be an implant and not an imprint.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If the mark of the beast is likely to be an implant, then it means that something will be planted into the body of those who will be left behind after the rapture, and it will be a sign of worshipping the beast (Revelation 20:4). It will be a sign that tells everyone, “I am loyal to the beast, I obey him.” The implant will be used to control them and ensure that they obey the beast whether they like it or not.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I will discuss this further tomorrow, but I want to urge you today to surrender your life to Jesus Christ if you are yet to do so. He died for your sins so that you can reign with Him in eternity. Don't let His sacrifice go to waste over you.</p>",

I also said that the mark will not be a tattoo printed on the skin but rather an implant, planted into the body of those who take it that submits their will to the government of that time, which will be headed by the antichrist. Today, I will discuss what will really be planted into the bodies of people that receive the mark of the beast.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you have been staying up to date with technology, you will have seen that technologies already exist to put microchips in people’s bodies so that with it, they can access the internet directly from their brains, make phone calls just by thinking, and have medical ‘miracles’ like healing a broken leg in record time, et cetera. From the experiments conducted with these microchips, scientists can see whatever the test subjects can see and even make them raise their hands or legs by controlling the chips from a computer. These microchips are connected directly to the brain so that whoever is controlling the microchips can control the minds of the people who have them. In other words, getting the mark means submitting yourself to the control of the government of that time. When they are in control, they can make people do whatever they want. That is why those who have the mark will be condemned because now, they cannot do the will of God as the antichrist is now in control of their minds. Getting the microchip in their bodies will seal their fate because the antichrist will control their minds to obey only him.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </strong></i>Romans 6:16&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The devil is aware of the Scripture above and hence knows that whomever you obey is your master. Everyone who takes the mark of the beast will become a servant of the devil.&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t take the risk of being around on the earth when almost everybody will become servants of the devil. It will be hell on earth, and it will be almost impossible to avoid taking the mark at that time. Give your life to Christ and live holy now so that you will be in heaven when the antichrist takes over the earth.</p>",

It is good news because all you have to do is tell Him, “I can't do it Lord, but I know you can do it through me.” There is something called 'the God Factor'. Let God do it; however, He can only do it if you are willing to cooperate. If you believe He can do it, He will do it.

Many people don't fulfil their assignments because they hardly go to God for instructions. They start the work quite alright, but they hardly pray for direction, whereas it is in the place of prayers that God will give them instructions on each step to take. They keep doing everything to make the work succeed, but when it is time to make decisions, they don't ask God for the best decisions to make. After a while, when they realise that they are not fulfilling the assignment, they accuse Him of helping others and not helping them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, you cannot do anything by yourself (John 15:5). The work God has given you to do cannot be done by your power or might but by His Spirit (Zechariah 4:6). If you really want to fulfil destiny, don't lean on your understanding; lean on God.</p>",

      "<p>Looking at today's topic, I'm sure you're asking yourself, 'How did the Father send me?' Acts 10:38 says that Jesus was sent to do good and to heal all that were oppressed of the devil, but then, He was anointed with the Holy Ghost and power for that assignment. That's why, concerning His ministers, Jesus said in Luke 24:49, <i><strong>“Tarry ye in Jerusalem until thou be endued with power from on high.”&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The condition for being a minister of God, according to Acts 6:1-3, is that you must be full of the Holy Spirit. Being baptised in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is good. However, other kinds of evidence must also be there. Acts 6:8 says that Stephen, a man full of the Holy Spirit, performed miracles. Where are the miracles that God has performed through you since your baptism in the Holy Spirit? In Acts 8:5-8, Philip, one of the deacons, went to Samaria and turned a whole city upside down. In Acts 13:6-12, when Paul was preaching to a governor, and a sorcerer was trying to hinder him, Paul, full of the Holy Spirit, moved the mountain out of the way and got his victory by the power of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p><br>We believers are dealing with a world called the New Age. They are working overtime to win our youths over with magic, and we need to demonstrate greater power to silence them so the youths do not give in to their devices. This power is available in God for all those who are willing to pay the price, but unfortunately, in a very subtle manner, the devil is pushing the church to lukewarmness.&nbsp;</p><p><br>You need to realise that whenever Jesus taught in a place, the Bible says that the power of God was always present to heal. I have discovered that when we preach about healing, God heals. When we tag a service 'deliverance night', a lot of demonised people in attendance will get delivered. We choose themes that show God that we are keenly interested in doing His works. He said that He will baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire (Luke 3:16). There is a difference between just speaking in tongues and having the fire behind your tongues. When you are baptised by the Holy Spirit and fire, it will be evident; miracles will happen, souls will be won, and the whole world will bow to our Lord. Seek the fire today!</p>",

      "<p>On earth, every government, ministry or industry has a leader who can be likened to a king sitting on a throne. Today's memory verse says that when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice. In other words, when things are going wrong, it is likely that it is not a righteous person bearing rule. The reason we have policies that clearly go against God's ways is that the people bearing rule and establishing such policies are not righteous. We have industries, political parties, and the likes that are obviously corrupt because the thrones in such places are occupied by unrighteous people; that is about to come to an end! Believers have to do what it takes to take thrones for God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I was quite close to a king in Western Nigeria before he died. We were so close that on one occasion, I slept in his palace. Because of how close we were, he got some of the anointing that God put upon me, so before he died, he made a decree. He did not want the people of his kingdom to go back to idol worship after his demise, so he decreed that anyone who is not born again would not sit on the throne again. It has been well over 20 years and even though there have been people that are keenly interested in the throne and some that have been chosen to sit on it, up till now, no one has occupied that throne. He took the throne for God completely so that his kingdom will only serve the living God. You can do the same, you can take the thrones of the places you operate in for God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Yes, you can take thrones for God by declarations. However, it is easier to dedicate thrones to God permanently when you are the one sitting on them. This means that you must work hard and strive to reach the top so that you can sit on thrones. Once you sit on a throne, you can sanitize the entire place spiritually, and take it over for God permanently. I pray that the grace to reach the top in your fields of operation will be released unto you, in Jesus' name. God will use you to take thrones from the devil's hands, in Jesus' name. Because of you, evil policies and corrupt practices will be abolished, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>Today's topic is a question you must be conscious of. In today's Bible reading, Jesus asked His disciples whom people said that He was. He wasn't confused about His identity; He knew who He was, but He was concerned about how people perceived Him. You must be conscious of how people perceive you too. People will only relate with you based on what they think about you and not what you think about yourself.&nbsp;<br><br>When my father in the Lord was alive, company executives would come to him for his opinion whenever they needed to hire staff for their company. They would say things like, “Sir, Brother so and so in your church has applied for a role in our company, what do you think about him?” Sometimes, he would cleverly reply, “That brother? Well, he says he is a Christian.” However, when they ask about someone who is truly born again, he will say, “That brother is a Christian.” There is a difference between who you claim to be and who you really are.&nbsp;<br><br>There are two kinds of people whose perception of you, you must take seriously. The first are people who know you but are not in your inner circle. They may not be close to you, but they are observant. They can build a perception about you from the things you say and do. Their perception may not be true, but as far as they are concerned, that is the true you. Therefore, you should endeavour not to make a mistake that will give them a wrong impression of you.&nbsp;<br><br>The second set of people are those in your inner circle. In today's Bible reading, the fellow who knew the real identity of Jesus was one of the people in His inner circle – Simon Peter. This tells us clearly that those who know us the best are the ones closest to us. Who does your spouse say you are? What about your children? These people know you more than anyone else, and their opinion must be very valuable to you. I have always said it, the reason some ministers' children are wayward is because they know who their parents are. They hear them preach one thing on the altar but see them do something else at home. This confuses them and draws them far from the God their parents claim to serve. You can pretend to people outside, but you cannot pretend to your family members.</p>",

I am praying for you today, that the Almighty God will cause you to hear from Him more clearly. When God begins to talk to you about what He wants to do, it shows that you have become His friend. In John 15:15, Jesus Christ said to His disciples:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.&nbsp;</strong></i><br><br>God said concerning Abraham that He could not hide whatever He was about to do from him. God is sovereign, He doesn't need permission from anybody to do anything, but there are certain people He must talk to before He does anything. You must sit down and really assess your relationship with God and become so close to Him that you can hear from Him yourself. You need to get to that stage where He will not hide anything from you. When you read Genesis 18, you will discover that Abraham was a friend of God. That was why God never hid anything from Him. Abraham wasn't just God's friend, Romans 4:16 describes him as the father of faith. Since without faith, it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6), Abraham being the father of faith means that he really pleased God.&nbsp;<br><br>You can get so close to God that He will tell you His secrets; things He won't tell anyone else. In John 13:21-26, everyone at the table asked Jesus about who will betray Him. He did not answer them, but He answered one fellow who was His favourite – John the Beloved.&nbsp;<br><br>It is such a beautiful thing to be able to tell anyone, no matter who they are, “God did not say that.” It shows that you are so special to God that if He is to talk to anyone, He will talk to you. For example, in 1 Kings 22:6-28, many prophets prophesied falsehood, but Micaiah, who heard from God directly, stood out and spoke the mind of God and it came to pass. If you are close to God, you cannot be deceived by anyone. I pray for you that soon, God will be sharing His secrets with you, in Jesus’ name</p>",

      "<p>In finance, there is something called<strong> </strong><i><strong>Return on Investment</strong></i><strong>.</strong> Likewise, in the kingdom of God, there is something I'll like to call <i><strong>Return on Seeds</strong></i><strong>.</strong> This is the profit you make when a seed is sown in the kingdom of God. According to today's Bible reading, there is the possibility of having a zero return on seeds sown, or a 30, 60 or 100-fold return. Also, as you will learn later in this series, there is the possibility of having an unlimited return on your seeds.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Two things determine your return on seeds: the first is what is left with you after sowing. In other words, how sacrificial is your seed? The second is the soil on which you sowed. Today, I will focus on the kind of soil that brings zero return on seeds.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many years ago, I was sowing seeds into a ministry abroad. I knew about the law of harvest, so I kept sowing. However, nothing was coming forth. I became worried, and so I started to ask God what was happening. Then, I had a dream. In the dream, I was standing on a farmland with heaps that showed that things had been sown on that land. I lifted one of the heaps, and underneath it was solid concrete. This meant that nothing could grow on that land. When I woke up, I knew the meaning of the dream – the ministry I had been sowing into was as good as concrete ground; no seed will yield returns when sown there.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you sow a seed in a place that God does not approve of, your seed will yield no return. God cares about the poor, therefore, when you sow into their lives, Psalm 41:1 says that He will deliver you in the day of trouble. God cares about His prophets and ministers, so when you sow into their lives, you will get a reward (Matthew 10:41-42). God cares about His Church, so when you sow into a ministry, you will be rewarded (Malachi 3:10-12). If the place you sow into only looks like a ministry from the outside but is devoid of God's presence, then your seeds will yield zero returns. You can decide to give anybody money if you wish, but if it is a seed, ensure that you are sowing in a place or a person that God is interested in.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't sow your seeds on concrete and expect a return, it will not yield anything.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I discussed the importance of ensuring that you are sowing on good soil. Today, I will examine the returns to be expected from seeds even when they are planted on good soils. First, let us focus on sowing into a man of God's life.</p><p><br><i><strong>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. </strong></i>Matthew 10:41</p><p><br>The spiritual hierarchy of the man of God you are sowing into will determine the level of the returns you will get from your seeds. Some seeds will yield 30-fold, some 60- fold and some 100-fold. Your seeds might be planted on good soil, but the richer the soil, the more the yield will be. In other words, the greater the spiritual height the fellow has reached, the greater the yield when you sow into his or her life. This is not to say that you should only sow into the lives of big men of God. In fact, there are some so-called 'small' men of God who have gone deeper in spiritual things than the popular ones; popularity is not a test of spirituality. Yes, it is good to sow into the lives of Bishops, General Overseers and Senior Pastors, but you must also not neglect the pastor that is close to you today, especially when God instructs you to do so.<br>I must mention here that your seeds are really sown to honour God and not any man. You can only sow through a man of God, but the one you are really giving to is the God that the man represents. Thus, if you only sow into the lives of those you have identified as big men of God, you are clearly trying to manipulate God, and God cannot be manipulated. All His children have needs, and if it is Him you really care about when sowing your seeds, then you will sow everywhere you know that He wants to meet a need.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Galatians 6:10, the Bible says that we should do good unto <i><strong>all</strong></i> men, <i><strong>especially</strong></i> those of the household of faith. Don't ignore the brother who is wearing a worn-out shoe to church while you go about changing the entire wardrobe of your pastor. If God has shown you a brother or sister's need, you should meet that need in honour of the God he or she serves.</p>",

      "<p>Over the last two days, I have discussed how you can get harvests from the seeds you sow. Today, I will focus on seeds that are sown based on God's instructions. These kinds of seeds go beyond yielding 100- fold, they yield unlimited returns. In 1 Kings 17:8-16, when Elijah told the widow to bring her last meal and she obeyed, the result was an unlimited supply of food for her household all through the famine. When God instructs you to give and you obey, He pours unlimited blessings on you.</p><p><br>When I became the General Overseer of RCCG, the entire monthly income of the church was less than my monthly salary as a lecturer before I resigned. By the time we managed to pay the salaries of the staff, there was usually nothing left for me. Things were tough, and I looked forward to collecting my gratuity because I had served the government for many years. My plan was to invest part of the money and save some, hoping that before I finished spending my savings, the church would have grown to the point where I could start getting paid a salary. When the gratuity came in, I remembered that God was now my Commander-in-Chief, so I asked Him how to spend the money. To my surprise, He said that I should divide it into three parts and give each part to different ministries. Nothing was to come to the ministry I was heading, even though we had needs. I trembled when He gave me that instruction, but then, He followed it with, “I will be your source.” I obeyed, and since then, He has truly been my source.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Malachi 3:10, God instructed that you should bring ten per cent of your income into His storehouse, and He will open the windows of heaven and pour down blessings that you will not have enough room to contain. This is an unlimited blessing that comes from obeying just one instruction. God blessed Abraham and told him that He will be his reward (Genesis 15:1). Imagine God Himself being someone's reward; that is an unlimited blessing. When you check what preceded that, you will discover that this blessing came after Abraham paid the first ever tithe to Melchizedek in Genesis 14:18-20. Your tithe is a major door to the unlimited blessings of God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When God instructs you to give, it is an opportunity for you to experience unlimited blessings from Him. Do not let such opportunities pass you by.</p>",

      "<p>As God is seated in heaven, He controls everything on earth because the earth is His footstool (Isaiah 66:1). In Psalm&nbsp;2:1-4, &nbsp;the Bible says that when enemies try to deal with the anointed of God, He that sits in heaven shall laugh. In other words, when someone threatens a believer, God laughs at the person. If someone says that you are not going to be promoted, He that sits in the heavens shall laugh. This is because promotion comes neither from the East nor West, but from God alone (Psalm 75:6-7). If a doctor says your case is hopeless, He that sits in the heavens shall laugh because He already settled your healing thousands of years ago by His stripes (Isaiah 53:5). If anybody tells you that you will not be successful in life, He that sits in heaven shall laugh because Deuteronomy 28:13 says that you shall be above only and not beneath.&nbsp;<br><br>While God is laughing at every evil intention of the devil over your life, you should not be crying, rather, you should be praising Him. Jesus Christ said in Matthew 6:27:</p><p><br><i><strong>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</strong></i></p><p><br>Your worrying will not solve adverse situations. When God is laughing, you should be laughing too. You should be mocking the mockers and standing on the ever-sure word of God, knowing fully well that your case is already settled in God. Don't cry like people who have no hope; you are a child of the King of all kings. Your Father owns the earth and all its fullness (Psalm 24:1), so there is nothing you need that is beyond your reach.</p><p><br>Philippians 4:6 says, <i><strong>“Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.”</strong></i> When you make your requests known to God, do so with thanksgiving. Don't come to Him as if you have no hope. James 1:6-7 says that if you come to Him without faith, you should not even think of receiving anything from Him. Since Hebrews 11:1 tells us that faith is the evidence of things not seen, then you must come with thanksgiving, knowing fully well that your requests are already granted. This is the right state of a true believer; he or she does not live in fear but in faith because of the consciousness of how big and powerful God is.</p>",

      "<p>The first time I read 1 Kings 3:4-15 after being born again, I thought to myself, “How did Solomon think of offering God a thousand burnt offerings?” This made me carry out a background check, and I discovered a secret. In 2 Samuel 12:24-25, the Bible tells us that God loved Solomon as soon as he was born. His father named him Solomon, but God named him Jedidiah, meaning beloved of the Lord. Because God loved Solomon, He wanted an opportunity to bless him in a way that nobody would be able to query Him, so He set him up by putting it in his heart to do something nobody had ever done before. That way, He also could do for Solomon what He had never done for anyone before.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When I joined RCCG in 1973, when there was any need in the church, they would ask only the children of God to wait behind. In those days, children of God meant those that are truly born again and know it. One day, my wife and I waited behind, and the General Superintendent said, “We have an urgent need that must be met this week. Every one of you should go and close your bank accounts and bring whatever money you have there to the church.” On Monday, my wife and I closed our savings accounts and took the money to church. The following Sunday, the General Superintendent said again that the children of God should wait behind. We waited. He announced that the need had been met, and we all rejoiced. Then he asked the question, “How many of you closed your accounts as I instructed?” My wife and I raised our hands, and when we looked around, no other hand was raised. Immediately, I thought to myself, “I hope I am not going crazy with this Christianity of mine.” Then, God spoke to me, “Son, you are not mad. I am allowing you to do what others have not done so that when I take you to where I am taking you, nobody will be able to query me.” The rest is history; it was a divine setup.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When God places it in your heart to give Him something, He is only setting you up for greatness. If you obey, you will be rejoicing later in future, but if you disobey, you will have missed a miracle. Whether you give or not, God has numerous ways to meet His need.

To achieve this, God passes them through a refining process to make them the best that they can ever be. Just like a goldsmith puts gold through fire for it to come out purer, God will take you through a refining fire for you to come out purer and better. Are you willing to go through the refining fire of God?.</p><p><br>In John 15:2, He said:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit</strong></i>.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you want to be a branch that is connected to the vine and bear fruits for God, you must be ready to go through a pruning process. It will be tough, but it will make you more fruitful.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In the pruning process, God will take away things that are competing with Him from your heart. He may ask you to stop wearing jewellery, not necessarily because it is a sin to wear them, but because they may be a distraction to your fruitfulness. He may allow persecution to arise against you so that you will draw closer to Him. As you draw closer to Him, you will become more like Him and be more fruitful. He might hold some things back from you for a while to test your faith, so that you can become perfect, wanting nothing (James 1:2-4).&nbsp;</p><p><br>At the end of the refining process, you will become so valuable that people will run over each other to favour you. Just like everyone wants gold in its purest form, you will become a spectacle to your generation. As everyone wants the best of fruits, you will have people from all over the world coming to glean from the great value that you possess. Those who successfully go through the pruning process of God become superstars in their generation because they carry great value that the whole world wants to glean from. They are problem solvers, and people see them as blessings. Money is never their problem because their value attracts money from all around the world. They don't beg for doors to open to them, their names open doors. Are you ready to be refined by God?</p>",

      "<p>The law of harvest is one of the strongest laws that God placed on earth. It is so powerful that God Himself will never break it. In Mark 14:36, Jesus Christ prayed fervently, sweating blood and praying that God should change the plan of salvation so that He wouldn't have to go to the cross to die for mankind. God said 'No!' He said ‘no’ because of the law of harvest; He had to sow His only Son in order to reap many more children into His kingdom (Romans 8:29, Hebrews 2:10, 1 Corinthians 15:20).&nbsp;</p><p><br>The law of harvest states that whatever a man sows, he will reap. This is well captured in Galatians 6:7:</p><p><br><i><strong>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Another beautiful thing about the law of harvest is that you will reap what you sow in greater proportions (Hosea 8:7). Therefore, whenever you give an offering or give alms, you are sowing a seed, and whatever you have given will come back to you in multiple folds. This is a law that nothing can break.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The law of harvest becomes much stronger when operated in two ways. The first is the law of firstfruit, while the second is the law of tithes. These two laws open the possibility of overflowing blessings. There are only two places in the Bible where God says that if you do something, He will bless you so much that there won't be enough room to take it (Proverbs 3:9-10 and Malachi 3:10). These two passages show us clearly the secret of overflowing blessings.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many times, when people pray for overflowing blessings, God expects them to obey the laws of firstfruits and tithes so that they can receive the blessings they seek. Believers will stop struggling with their finances when they obey the divine law of harvest in their work, business, and in giving.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Almighty God Himself put the law of harvest in place and expects us to obey it. For example, when I was first told about tithing, it didn't make sense to me mathematically, but I obeyed. I wondered back then, if one hundred per cent was not enough to take care of my needs, how can ninety per cent be sufficient after taking out ten per cent as tithe? Thank God I decided to test the law of tithing, and, to my surprise, I discovered that it was true.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will conclude my teaching on the law of harvest. As a mathematician, I learned early that laws only stand when certain conditions are present. For example, the law of gravity simply states that when you throw an object up, it will fall to the ground. When the conditions present favour the law of aerodynamics, the law of gravity, as powerful as it is, will not hold.&nbsp;</p><p><br>For any law to stand, some conditions must be met. Yesterday, I discussed how powerful the law of harvest is, but in spite of its power, it will only stand when you sow under the right conditions. First, you must sow on good ground. I mentioned earlier this month when I was discussing the series, 'Return on Seeds', that I sowed multiple times into a ministry abroad many years ago, but got no harvest. God showed me in a dream that I had been sowing on hard ground. Some ministries and ministers are not linked to God. When you sow into them, you might think you are giving God an offering, but it never gets to Him because they are hard grounds. This is why you must be sure of the places you sow your seeds. Matthew 10:41 says that when you give to a prophet, you will get a prophet's reward. Some people claim to be prophets, but God does not recognise them at all. Discern before you sow.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Also, don't sow grudgingly. If you sow as if you are being forced to sow, God will not accept your offering. 2 Corinthians 9:7 says that He loves a cheerful giver. You may sow sacrificially, such that it is so hard for you to release the seed and you shed tears while doing so, but you must never sow grudgingly; you must sow from a willing heart.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, I was at a service, and the people conducting the service were calling for multiple offerings. I became angry, and as I wanted to bring out an offering, God told me, “I don't want your money.” I immediately repented and changed my perception. God is not a beggar. If you bring an offering to Him grudgingly, it may enter the offering basket, but God will not accept it, and you will reap nothing from it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, for you to make the law of harvest work in your life, ask God to show you a good land where you can sow and when you find it, make sure you sow willingly.</p>",

When a person seeks other things above God, such a fellow will struggle, but if he or she seeks God first, other things will be added unto him or her.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What you prioritise determines the quality of your life. When you receive your first harvest in any field, you must take it to God. This is a sign that you honour and put Him first, and as such, other harvests will be secure (Proverbs 3:9-10).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many people put money before God; this is why they experience sorrows that money cannot solve. Some wealthy people cannot sleep at night, and will gladly trade their wealth to have peace and joy. The problem is usually what or whom they prioritise. The rich man in Matthew 19:16-22 knew that something was missing in his life. He had been obeying the law and had lots of money, but he felt incomplete. He met Jesus for a solution and was told that his problem was with his priorities; he prioritised money above following Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If God tells you to sell all you have, forget about your dreams, and go into full-time ministry, will you do it? Your answer will determine if you prioritise Him or not. When you check through the Scriptures, those who prioritised God were greatly rewarded. For example, the blessings of Abraham exist today because He prioritised God over everything, even his own son (Genesis 21:10). I am a living example of the benefits of prioritising God. I left my thriving career in academics and my dream of becoming the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa to become the General Overseer over a church whose monthly income was less than my salary because God said so. Today, the name Adeboye is known all around the world because I prioritised God above my dreams.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God is a jealous God (Exodus 34:14); He cannot take second place in your heart. Whatever or whomever you prioritise above God has become a god to you. God said that you should have no other god before Him (Exodus 20:3). You must love Him with all your heart, soul and mind; this is the greatest and foremost commandment (Matthew 22:37-38). When you do this, everything else will fall into place in your life.

You must not let your staff work for seven days a week; they must have at least one day to rest and be refreshed (Exodus 23:12). This is important for them to be productive the next week. Also, you will get the best out of your farmland if you leave it to rest for one year every seven years (Leviticus 25:4). It is a law that will increase your productivity greatly.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you think that working for seven days will bring more productivity than working for six days every week, you are wrong. There is a fast-food restaurant in the United States of America that works for only six days and is closed on Sundays. That restaurant is one of the fastest\u0002growing fast-food restaurants in the world. Resting for one day every week greatly improves your productivity as opposed to working for seven days a week.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Working continuously without rest will damage an individual's health. Many people have died because they did not rest as they ought to. Going against this law can bring great danger to a fellow's health and life. I was telling one of my sons about this law of rest, and he looked at me in a funny way as if to say, “You? Do you rest?” I told him that I rest, even though he may not know it. I wouldn't be this productive if I don't rest. In fact, there are periods in the year when I don't go anywhere; I just stay in a quiet place to rest. My body will no longer be useful to God if I damage it just because I am so zealous about the ministry that I disregard the law of rest.</p>",

      "<p>The law of work is similar to Newton's first law of motion, which states, in simple terms, that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless it is acted upon by an external force. In other words, nothing moves until someone moves it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>An individual's career will not move forward without deliberate efforts to advance it, neither will a marriage be automatically blissful without some effort from both parties. A believer's spiritual life will not blossom unless he or she puts in the required work. Nothing goes for nothing. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says that those who don't work should not eat. Some people feel that because they have certain gifts and talents, things will always be good for them – that is a big lie. One of my sons often says that hard work will beat talent if talent doesn't work hard.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Matthew 25:14–30, the Master gave His servants some talents with a simple instruction, “Trade with it.” You cannot leave your talent(s) dormant if you want to be fruitful. You must work on your talent(s) if you want positive results. The servant that did not work on his talent was punished greatly. If a believer does not work on whatever God has given to him or her, such a fellow will be greatly punished in the end.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One day, I met a pastor who started out in ministry at around the same time as me, and he said, “God has really been good to you.” I agree, God has been very good to me. It is only by His grace that I have come this far. However, nobody can accuse me of being lazy. When I was starting out, God gave me prophecies, gifts of the Spirit and talents, but all these things would have gone to waste if I did not work hard. In fact, the more resources God gives you, the harder you must work because Luke 12:48 says that to whom much is given, much is expected.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Brethren, if a person is not ready to work, then he or she is not ready to succeed at anything in life. Nothing will excuse anyone from the effects of this law. Excuses are for failures. No matter the excuse you may want to give for not being productive, it will never suffice as there are people who have experienced greater challenges and surmounted them. Great achievers put excuses aside, get to work, and make the best out of whatever situations they find themselves in.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Get up and work.</p>",

      "<p>The law of unity is one of the most amazing laws that God set up on the earth. The Bible states that one will chase a thousand and two will chase ten thousand (Deuteronomy 32:30). This doesn't make any sense mathematically, but I have found it to be true.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jesus said in Matthew 18:19 that if two people shall agree concerning a thing, it shall be done by His Father in heaven. In other words, if you have prayed and are yet to get an answer, find someone to agree with you in prayers, and you will receive the answer. In Psalm 133:1-2, the unity amongst brethren is likened to the anointing. Unity is a very powerful force; it is so powerful that even the Holy Spirit did not descend until the disciples were in one accord in the Upper Room (Acts 2:1-4). There are certain things you will never achieve until you apply the law of unity to it. A husband and wife who are always fighting are denying themselves of many great things. If they can only humble themselves, resolve their differences, and agree as one, they will become a great force against all their problems, and there will be nothing beyond their reach. Church members who are always gossiping about each other or quarrelling amongst themselves don't know what they are losing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In our Bible reading for today, some people came together to build a tower that would reach heaven. God saw them and said that they would achieve their goal because they were united. This was thousands of years ago when there was hardly any technology. In other words, God was saying that even without adequate resources, unity alone was enough for those people to build such a tower.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In the early days of RCCG, we had no money. We didn't even have money to pay all the staff, but we were very united. As a result, we did many great things, including building the biggest auditorium of that time. There is absolutely no gain in being divided. Matthew 12:25 says a house divided against itself shall not stand. Whenever the devil wants to destroy a move of God or hinder Christians from achieving something, he sows discord amongst them.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>One of the many reasons I bless God for the wife He gave to me is that she is always facilitating unity everywhere she goes. She is always bringing people together; never allowing disunity in any group she belongs. Even with my extended family, she is a binding force. She will never allow anybody carry a long face around her, whatever the problem is must be solved before anybody goes to bed that day. That quality is a divine gift that has been a great blessing to my life and ministry.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Never give room for disunity. Don't let the devil win; don't allow disunity.</p>",

      "<p>The law of association is a very powerful law that every human being on earth must understand and apply correctly. This law is subtle in its operation, and many people don't realise when it is working on them. They don't realise that the people they often speak to, greatly influence the way they think and act. This law states that an individual becomes like the people he or she associates with. In other words, if a fellow associates with wise people, he or she will become wise. Likewise, if the fellow associates with foolish people, he or she will become foolish. It is stated clearly in Proverbs 13:20:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>He that walks with the wise shall be wise but the companion of fools shall be destroyed.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The elders in Yorubaland usually say, “When a leaf stays long with a soap, it will also become a soap.” You must carefully choose the people you associate with. If your friend is not someone you admire and want to be like, you should unfriend that fellow immediately. Be friends with wise people that can challenge you, people you can discuss great ideas with. Don't be friends with people who gossip and are only interested in entertainment when you are together.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Another form of association is with the media. Some people spend a lot of time watching television and scrolling through social media. Whatever you read or watch has a great influence on who you become. If you read and watch inspiring things, they will inspire you to become great. Anyone who reads and watches immoral content will eventually become corrupt, as we can see in our memory verse for today.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What kind of content do you constantly consume? Whose content are you consuming on social media? Whose music do you listen to? These things are a pointer to who you are becoming. When you want to change something about yourself, change the people you associate with. If you want to get better with your academics, keep company with brilliant people and learn from those who have excelled academically, and you will see your grades get better. If you want to be more fervent in your Christian life, find friends who read their Bibles, and pray regularly. Soon, you will also be doing the same.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Examine the kind of friends you keep and the kinds of content you consume. Are they a reflection of who you want to become? If they are not, change them now.</p>",

Jesus put it this way in Matthew 6:33:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>If you seek God's righteousness and seek to do things that are right in His sight, without a doubt, the material things that other people are seeking will begin to pursue you and overtake you. This is a law that cannot be broken.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When my father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, was alive, he used to say that it is what your father has that he will use to take care of you. Romans 6:16 says that whomever a person yields himself or herself to obey is that fellow's master. This means that if someone obeys the devil and commits sin, the devil will take care of the fellow with what he has. Also, if the fellow obeys the Lord and lives righteously, God will take care of him or her with what He has. The devil has nothing else to offer than to kill, steal, and destroy (John 10:10); if anyone obeys him, that is what he or she will get. If you obey Christ and live in righteousness, the same John 10:10 says that what He has to offer you is abundant life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, there is absolutely no gain in sin. The things that look like the gains of sin are actually baits of the devil. When a hunter is trying to catch an animal in the forest, he puts the animal's best food inside a trap. When the animal tries to grab the food, it gets trapped. Beware of whose food you are eating. If you have to compromise on God's word to get that food, it is only a trap for the devil to destroy your soul. Whatever hunters use to feed their catch is nothing compared to what they will take from the catch.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil will never give you anything without collecting more from you. Obey the law of righteousness, and you will enjoy the blessings of God.</p>",

Their goal is to boost their self-esteem rather than admonish the people who made the mistake or bring them to Christ. The people who attempted to stone the adulterous woman in John 8:1-11 were just like this. They did not expect that Jesus would put the searchlight of righteousness on them; He humiliated them as they planned to humiliate her.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When we correct someone just to show how righteous we are, we are attacking their self-esteem, adding to the weight of guilt they already bear, and making it more difficult for them to come to Christ. God turns against people who condemn others to prove that they are righteous. When Jesus sees a fallen soldier in His army, He wants to help the fellow up. If He discovers that other soldiers are throwing stones at the fellow to kill him or her completely, He turns against those soldiers to defend the one who is wounded.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It is unfortunate that many Christians use their superiority complex to hand their own brothers and sisters over to the devil. For example, who is a young Christian girl supposed to turn to if she becomes pregnant out of wedlock? Fellow believers or unbelievers? In most cases, her church members might call her a prostitute and make her feel unwanted, while unbelievers may show her care and understanding. When soldiers are wounded, they need people to help them dress their wounds so they can stand up again. If the people they get help from are from the enemy's camp, they may never return to their own camp again. This is why many backsliders keep going deeper into sin. They think that they will no longer find forgiveness and acceptance in the church, so they backslide completely. The Holy Spirit is still drawing them toward the church, but they are reluctant to go back out of the fear of being condemned by the people who should show love to them the most.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, if a fellow believer falls, don't condemn the person. Don't turn such a person into an object of gossip, rather, get other Christians together to pray and follow up on the fellow until he or she comes back to God. This was the testimony about Job in Job 4:3-4.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

Any marriage where the husband and wife compete against each other will not stand because Mark 3:25 says that a house divided against itself shall not stand. Husband, your wife is a gift from God to help you achieve His purpose for your life. You must create the environment that encourages her to help you rather than compete with you. If not for my wife's help and the grace of God, I would not have achieved all I have achieved in ministry today. Ask God to give you the wisdom to know what to do to get your spouse to help you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I always encourage and give room for my wife to help me. I don't hide things from her, rather, I hand some things over to her to handle. After major programmes like our annual conventions, I buy her gifts to say, “Thank you for your support.” This encourages her to help me more in subsequent programmes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Wives, stop trying to compete with your husbands. Don't follow the recent worldly trend that is seeking to overturn the roles of husbands and wives in marriages. Don't turn your marriage into a competition where there is a winner and a loser. One person's win is a win for both of you. The more impact your spouse makes, the prouder you should be. In Proverbs 31:23, the Bible says that a good wife makes her husband proud. Husband, if your wife is making an impact in places of authority, you should hold your head up high; it does not reduce you as a man; it enhances you. It shows that you know how to nurture talent well, and things flourish in your hands.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Let all involved parties play their part in ensuring a successful home. If every footballer on a field tries to be the striker so that they can boast of the number of goals they score, who will be the goalkeeper and ensure that the opponent doesn't score against them? The fact that you are a defender does not make you any less valuable than the striker. Play your part, and you will both enjoy the rewards of success. Don't leave your duty post to compete with your teammate and end up losing in life entirely. Handle your role, support your spouse, and your entire family will win at the end of the day.</p>",

Don't stay in secluded places alone with someone of the opposite sex. Don't have immoral conversations with that fellow who claims to be your friend because evil communication corrupts good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33). If someone is making sexual advances at you, run! Don't give room for the fellow to try and convince you at all. When Potiphar's wife was trying to get Joseph to sleep with her, he ran for his dear life (Genesis 39:7-12).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, there is no point in Christians entering into romantic relationships if the mutual intention is not marriage – a relationship like that is a time bomb, waiting to blow up its participants. If you cannot tell your pastor that you want to go into a relationship with someone, then you must not go into that relationship. A child of God should not have casual romantic relationships, rather, he or she should have a fiancé or fiancée.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are mature enough to get married, and the desire to have sexual relations is getting so much that it is difficult to cope, then get married. God sanctions sexual relations only within the confines of marriage. To avoid the destruction that comes with fornication, it is better that you get married.

Today, the name 'Adeboye' is known around the world because my parents used the money from selling their properties to pay my school fees.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Spend your money wisely; invest in your children because they are the arrows you will send to your future. They will be there for you when you are old, and when you are long gone, the results of your investment in them will still be obvious. There is an adage in Yorubaland that says that if you decide to build a house rather than build your child, the child you refused to build will sell off the house you built.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Choose to send your children to the best schools you can afford. Choose to spend quality time with them to teach them the basic principles of life and God's word. No investment in your children ever expires. Ecclesiastes 7:8 says that better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof. It is better to wear rags now and train your children than to wear the best clothes and leave your children untrained. It doesn't matter what you wear today; if your children are well-trained, they will buy you the best clothes and cars and even build houses for you when they get older.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, training your children well is important if you want to enjoy long-term prosperity and peace of mind.</p>",

      "<p>Nowadays, many young people think that they are superior to elders because they believe they are more sophisticated. An elder is an elder, regardless of their educational, financial, and/or social status. People must always honour elders if they don't want curses on their heads (Deuteronomy 27:16).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Today's memory verse says that when you see an elder coming, you must rise up in honour of the elder. Don't let an elder pass by you without greeting them. If an elder is carrying something, you must run to them and help with whatever they are carrying. When an elder is talking to you, don't talk back immediately; let the elder finish speaking before you speak. Take a cue from Elihu in Job 32:4:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Furthermore, in Job 32:6, Elihu did not just share his opinion; he spoke with honour to the elders, telling them that he was afraid to speak because he was before them. In verse 8, you will see that Elihu was the one who spoke the words that we often quote, “There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives him understanding.” Clearly, he was wise and had understanding from God. You cannot claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit and dishonour your elders; that would be a lie.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Now you may say, what if an elder has done something terrible that is not expected from elders? The Bible says in 1 Timothy 5:1-3 that you must never rebuke an elder. It may surprise you to know that when Elihu did the things I referred to in the previous paragraph, he was very angry with the elders. He was angry with Job because Job was self-righteous, justifying himself rather than God. Yet, he waited for him to finish speaking before sharing his opinion with honour. Don't say you have holy anger and speak to an elder disrespectfully. Don't claim to be fighting for God and dishonour an elder. No matter how wrong an elder is, you must share your opinion respectfully and never dishonour them.</p>",

      "If you have elders around you, you have rare wisdom around you, and you should learn from their wealth of wisdom. There are certain things that elders know that Google, as vast as it is, does not know. The elders have some alternative treatments for sicknesses and diseases that modern science has not caught up with yet. There are some experiences that they have when it comes to relating with other people that you cannot learn in any book or university. If you take care of your elders and learn from them, there is a lot you will know and have as an advantage over your peers. In Yorubaland, when we see a child behaving wisely, we call him or her Omo Agba meaning the child of an elder, because we know straight away that he or she must have learnt a lot from an elderly person. <br>With all of Moses' education in Egypt, the greatest nation in those days, his father-in-law, Jethro, was the one who taught him a valuable lesson about delegation. Moses got the best leadership education in the world and thought he was a good leader until he was exposed to an elder's wisdom. Jethro's counsel showed him that he was not that wise after all. You may think you are wise because you are educated and have the internet at your fingertips, but if you listen to the elders, you will discover a lot of truth that will really help you in life. <br>When an elder advises you, take that advice dearly because what you do with it could be the difference between success and failure. In 1 Kings 12:6, King Rehoboam met with elders on how to rule the people. They gave him advice which was filled with wisdom. However, he went to meet his younger friends for advice, and because theirs seemed more exciting, he pushed aside the advice of the elders. Rehoboam's actions caused a civil war, and he lost the kingdom of Israel, as we see in verses 18 and 19: <br><strong><em>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</em></strong> <br>Never despise the advice of godly elders.",

Many years ago, when The Redeemed Christian Church of God was not as big as it is now, my mother-in-law said that it was difficult to differentiate between the pastor who was a mechanic and the one who was a lecturer in the university because they all looked alike in their suits on Sundays. However, the secret comes out on Mondays when everyone goes to their places of work. Some people know how to dress like Christians and even speak and pray like fervent Christians, but deep within them, they are unbelievers. Being in this world is like their Sunday; no one can tell the difference now. However, Monday is coming at rapture; then, the difference will be clear. Believe me, it does not matter if everyone in the world thinks that a fellow is the closest person to Jesus Christ. If he or she is not truly born again, Jesus will deny the fellow on the last day.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jesus Christ said in Luke 5:37-38 that if you put new wine in an old wineskin, both the content and the container will be lost forever.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>You cannot call Jesus 'Lord' and keep on obeying the devil. If you do so, you are trying to put new wine (the Holy Spirit) into an old wineskin (your sinful heart), which will only result in destruction at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some people can deceive the whole world with their container, but that will only put them in more trouble because it will become more difficult for them to get on the right track with God. Many pastors have gone to hell because when they realised that they should genuinely give their lives to Christ, they were too ashamed to come out for an altar call or make restitution for the things they had done while they were pretending. Don't pretend to be a Christian; genuinely give your life to Christ if you haven't done so and live a holy life henceforth</p>",

However, the captains and soldiers that were sent to arrest him never lived to tell the story. You may look the same to your enemies, but the moment you are baptised with the Holy Ghost and fire, if they try to touch you, they will be consumed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>To become dangerous to your enemies, ensure that you carry the fire of God inside you in great measure. For over 13 years, I never went to my village because witches and wizards had threatened to deal with me. I became born again, and not long after I was baptised with the Holy Spirit and fire, I received an invitation to attend a programme in the village. When I told my mother about the invitation, she begged me not to go. I told her that I now carry fire and anyone who touches me will roast. She said, “But you don't look any different; you are the same Adejare that I know.” I replied, “The naked wire looks the same whether electricity is passing through it or not. However, touching it while electricity is passing through it is a suicide attempt.” I went to the village, and no witch dared to touch me. Today, I announce my arrival beforehand so they can hide before I arrive.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Nigeria, after drinking a bottle of Coke, we sometimes use the empty bottle as a container for kerosene. Once the bottle has become a kerosene container, you dare not put it in your mouth again. The devil knows that once you start carrying fire, he has to step carefully around you. If he has been tormenting you, the way to get him off your shoulder is to carry the fire of God. Pray so often that the fire of God starts boiling inside you. Become addicted to praying in the Holy Ghost. As you do this, the fire of God will burn inside you, and you will become dangerous for the devil to attack. Any yoke he had previously placed on you will break completely, and you will be free from his hold. When you have the fire of God burning in your bones, you will become a threat to the devil and his demons. Are you ready to carry God's fire?</p>",

      "<p>Faith comes through God's word (Romans 10:17). The more you study God's word, the greater your faith becomes. Also, when God speaks to you directly, your faith increases. For example, when Abraham heard God speak to Him directly about having many children, it stirred up his faith (Genesis 15:5-6). There is great power in studying the word of God and in hearing His voice.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When I asked God for a small apartment in a suburb of Lagos, He told me that He would give me a city instead. This sounded ridiculous, but hearing it from Him directly built up so much faith in me that I started telling people what God told me. For your faith to really grow, don't just study the word and pray; seek to hear from God concerning your life. Once you hear Him give you a promise, His voice will cause a surge in your faith.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Furthermore, just as you grow your muscles through physical exercise, grow your faith by exercising it as well. If you believe God for something and don't make any move in line with what you believe, your faith will never grow. When I decided to believe that paying tithes would bring me blessings, I took action to pay my tithes. I discovered that God supernaturally improved my finances after doing that. Immediately, my faith grew. I then knew, without any doubt, that paying tithes attracts God's blessings, but I didn't get to that level of faith until I had acted on the little faith I had initially. As you believe God for little things and see them fulfilled, your faith will grow for big things. Act your faith; dare to do things that are greater than your human capacity, knowing that you serve a limitless God. Jump and let Him catch you. The more you do this and succeed, the stronger your faith will be.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Lastly, testimonies will also grow your faith. Hearing someone's testimony builds faith in you to know that God can also move on your behalf. Many people have testified at our Holy Ghost Services that they got their miracle because they heard someone else' testimony. I started operating in divine health when I heard the testimony of a man that was bent double whom God healed completely. From that testimony, I knew that God can heal all diseases, so I trusted Him completely with my health. Listen to more testimonies; purposely search for testimonies of people who have gone through what you are going through. As you hear their testimonies, your faith will rise, and you will also get your miracle.</p>",

Leaders are raised from amongst the followers, so the better the followers, the better the quality of leaders.</p><p><br>Submission is one of the greatest attributes that a follower can have. It is different from cooperation. You cooperate when you agree with a leader's instructions, but you are submissive when you obey, whether you agree with the instruction or not. Not being submissive indicates that a follower is acting in his or her own interest rather than the interest of the entire group that the leader represents. Some followers steal because they are ready to sacrifice the interest of the entire group to satisfy their personal interests. If this behaviour continues unchecked and the follower eventually becomes a leader, he or she will only care about himself or herself.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Gehazi showed this in 2 Kings 5:20-27. Elisha had collected nothing from Naaman for curing his leprosy, but Gehazi was after his personal interest as opposed to that of the Lord, which his master represented. He proceeded to collect gifts from Naaman and was immediately struck with leprosy. Judas Iscariot was also recorded to have been stealing from the ministry's purse (John 12:6). This is why he could not be amongst the apostles to carry the gospel around the world after Jesus left. Such a person will never make a good leader because his or her personal interest will be more important than common interests.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some people may say, “I don't steal, I just disobey my leader because I don't like him.” This is, however, just as bad as stealing. In Matthew 25:24-30, the servant who was given one talent to trade with did not steal the talent, he hid it rather than trade with it as instructed because he did not like his master's leadership style. The master wasn't annoyed that he did not trade with it as instructed, but that he could have at least put it in the bank to yield some interest. Putting it in the bank would have shown that even though he did not like his master, he was interested in the company's prosperity. This made his master call him an unfaithful servant. He was more particular about himself, which is a bad trait for any follower or leader.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, if you want to be a good leader, you must first be a good follower by obeying your leader and putting common interests above yours.</p>",

Today, I will discuss more attributes of a good follower.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Leaders are not omnipotent; they need help sometimes. Good followers recognise that their leader needs help and seek to provide it before the leader asks for it. They watch to see which areas they can support the leader in and provide the support as needed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In today's Bible reading, Moses did not ask for Aaron and Hur's help. He did not even explain why he was stretching his hands towards the battlefront. They both saw him stretching his hands and noticed that they were winning as he did so. They also noticed that his hands were getting tired, so they went to him, gave him a stone to sit on, and held up his hands. That is good followership, the kind that will make a leader surmount any mountain that stands in his or her way.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sometimes, supporting your leader will not be convenient. When Aaron and Hur helped Moses, they were not sitting down, neither was anyone helping to hold their own hands up. They must have gotten tired too, but they stayed like that until the battle was over. Sometimes, when you step in to help your leader's weakness, others might laugh at you and even call you names. However, you must not fail your leader; you must take whatever comes with helping out.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It is a terrible thing when followers take advantage of their leader's weaknesses. Some followers, because their leader doesn't know how to keep track of money, start stealing from the accounts instead of helping to manage them. Some others tell people about their leaders' weaknesses to discredit them. If there is someone in the Bible that every follower should study, it is David. Even though he had already been anointed as the next king of Israel in 1 Samuel 16:13 and had done many exploits (1 Samuel 17:48-51, 1 Samuel 18:5-7), even though he had seen Saul's weaknesses (1 Samuel 16:23), he remained loyal and never discredited the king. While running for his life because Saul was trying to kill him, he got the opportunity to kill Saul but didn't do it (1 Samuel 24:4-13) – that is a good follower! As a result, he not only fulfilled his destiny, but the King of kings, who is also called the Son of David, came from his lineage (Revelation 22:16).</p>",

However, leaders need to be corrected so they don't put their followers in trouble.

Years ago, I published a book in which I tried to justify the statement of the midwives in Exodus 1:15-19, where they said that the Hebrew women were very strong and delivered their babies without assistance. Somebody who read the book boldly came to me and said, “I know you are the General Overseer, but sir, this justification is wrong.” I realised the error, thanked him, and said, “I will go to God; He knows I didn't mean to lead anyone astray.” I re-wrote the book, stood before the congregation, and said, “I have made a mistake. I wrote something in this book that should not have been written.

Thank God someone was bold enough to correct me. Today, with how God has increased our influence, it would have been difficult to erase that error from the minds of people in the body of Christ if that fellow had felt that I could not be corrected.</p><p><br>In correcting a leader, ensure that it is for the good of the leader and other followers rather than to show that you know better. Discuss with the leader privately, showing love and respect. Present the matter in a way that will be easy to accept, or find someone that is closer to the leader to present it on your behalf. The leader might find it easier to take the correction from that fellow than from you.</p>",

      "<p>As&nbsp;I conclude my teaching on good followership which I started some days ago, it is important to note that no matter how strong leaders may appear to be, they need to be encouraged sometimes by their followers. This is primarily because leadership is full of ups and downs. During the down moments, encouraging leaders will go a long way in helping them to succeed. Speaking words of encouragement, sending gifts, and honouring your leaders in whatever way you can, will help them feel encouraged to keep going, despite the burden of leadership.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many years ago, I felt discouraged. I had resigned from my lucrative lecturing job to become the church's General Overseer and spent almost all my time praying for people and teaching them. There was a lot of burden on me, yet it seemed no one appreciated my efforts. One day, I was so discouraged and tired of my position as the General Overseer and then I fell asleep in my office. When I woke up, a young girl was in my office with a cake. She said that God had told her to bring me the cake. I don't really like cakes, but I ate it because I was really touched by her thoughtfulness. When God lays it in your heart to do something to encourage your leader, please do not hesitate to do it; it may be the difference between the leader giving up or continuing the work.</p><p><br>A good follower will always try to reduce the stress on a leader rather than add to it. Leaders are human beings like you; they face challenges just like you do, and even more as a result of the leadership position they occupy. You may not be able to totally relieve them of the stress that comes with leadership, but you can encourage them so they don't feel all their effort is a waste, and so they can keep doing more. Some years ago, I was really down, but what helped me to get up and keep going was the message of one of my daughters in the Lord. She said, “Daddy, let God carry you.” Your message may be what God will use to encourage your leader.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When Jesus was close to His crucifixion, He took Peter, James and John to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray alongside Him; He needed their encouragement for the task ahead.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Pray for your leaders. Sometimes, seeing that you are praying for them is the encouragement they need to keep going.</p>",

      "<p>Today's cell phones are extremely effective; with them, you can communicate with anybody in the world. Despite this being a positive thing, you must be careful not to live under your phone's influence. You must not get addicted to your phone or live by it because Jesus said that man is to live by every word that comes out of God's mouth (Matthew 4:4). Your Bible is what you must be addicted to and live by, not your phone. If you are not conscious of this, your phone may easily replace the word of God in your life, and this is quite dangerous because the Bible says that our God is a jealous God (Exodus 34:14).&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you wake up in the morning, do you pick up your phone first or your Bible? You may say that you pick up your phone to check the time, but really, do you study the apps on your phone first or the verses in your Bible? Throughout the day, what do you have more on your mind, what you saw on your phone or what you read in the Bible? You are to meditate on God's word day and night, not on social media feeds and reels. When you want to start a conversation with your friend in your DM, what interesting thing do you start with, a funny meme or a Scripture? Ephesians 5:19 says that we are to speak to each other in psalms and hymns, but many no longer have such conversations; it is all about celebrity gossip and memes. Can you see that there is a need to repent if your heart has been drawn away from God for so long without you knowing it? It is time to return to God's word and become addicted to it again. It is time to begin to study the word first thing in the morning and last thing at night every day.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If your heart has been drawn away from God, to bring your heart back to God's word, you will have to exercise a lot of self-control. You must take decisive actions and stick with them. For example, decide to charge your phone far from you and put your Bible beside your pillow at bedtime. This way, you will read it before you sleep and pick it up when you wake up. You may need to delete some apps that you are addicted to. The time spent on them can be put to better use in prayers and the study of the word of God.</p>",

Today's Bible text clearly states that you are not to forsake the fellowshipping together of brethren. Therefore, if you choose to attend a service online when you can very well attend that service physically, you are forsaking the fellowshipping together with brethren for your comfort.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Due to your preference for comfort over fellowship, many things might follow. Some of these may include picking up phone calls or browsing social media while the service is going on. Also, you might be eating and drinking when you should be concentrating on receiving the bread of life from heaven. In that state, it is easy to welcome distractions from visitors who knock on your door and even things that you suddenly remember that you ought to have done. These things will take your mind completely off the service and make you miss out on what God is doing at that moment. On the other hand, if you are present at a service physically, there will be little or no distractions because almost everybody around you will be focused on God. They will be praying or worshipping God fervently, and the environment around you will be charged; that fire will kindle your own fire too. This is not the same as watching a service on TV. Tell me, if you put on your TV and a TV station is showing a house that is burning, will you feel the heat in your house?&nbsp;</p><p><br>Except there is absolutely no way to attend a physical service, either due to distance or other challenges, you cannot get the same impact from the service by watching it at home. God sees your heart; He knows when you are choosing comfort over fellowship with the brethren. He is the one who said that you should not forsake the fellowshipping together of the brethren, so He will not encourage you to disobey Him. There is always a difference between someone watching God move and someone being a part of the move of God.</p>",

A tree's roots are a primary determinant of its state, so in the same vein, things in the physical realm are determined by the spirit realm. For example, in Exodus 14:16, Moses stretched his rod and parted the Red Sea. Ordinarily, a sea cannot be parted by stretching a rod; there had to be a spiritual force working on the sea, and that force was what parted it. Now, when you consider that the fellow stretching the rod was a physical being, then he must have had a connection with the root of all things on the earth to control the sea, and that connection is with God. Believe me, if you are a true child of God, there is nothing on earth that you cannot control. You have complete authority over everything because Psalm 82:6 says that you are a god.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Many years ago, we were to have Bible Study at a professor's house at the University of Ibadan, but then it started raining. We were so many that the sitting room couldn't contain us, so I used my authority as a child of God to command the rain to stop. The rain stopped, and we had our Bible Study. Not long after we finished, some other people arrived. They were surprised to see that it wasn't raining in the professor's compound because the reason they arrived late was that it was raining everywhere else on the campus. The moment you become a child of God, you have authority over everything that has its root in the spirit realm and that includes the weather, elements of nature, and even demons. If you are a part of God's family, you are a king, and where the word of a king is, there is power (Ecclesiastes 8:4).&nbsp;</p><p><br>You must note, however, that if a fellow is not a true child of God and tries to exercise God's authority, he or she will be disgraced like the sons of Sceva (Acts 19:13-16). You must note also that whatever you use your authority to decree must be in line with the word of God. A house divided against itself cannot stand (Matthew 12:25). If you are really a child of God, you will act in line with the word of your Father.</p>",

The leper in Matthew 8:2-3 worshipped Him, the centurion in Matthew 8:5-10 didn't send a messenger but came personally to ask Jesus to heal his servant, and the woman in Matthew 15:22-28 was practically insulted by Jesus when He likened her to a dog, but she took no offence. On the other hand, everyone that would have gotten a miracle from Jesus but didn’t, exhibited pride in one way or the other, especially the people of His hometown (Matthew 13:54-58). The Bible says that He was only able to do a few miracles there.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Naaman almost died a leper because of pride. He went to the prophet for healing and was told to go and wash in River Jordan. He got angry and wanted to return to his country to die as a leper because he thought that a man of his calibre should not wash in the Jordan river. Thank God for his servants who talked sense into his head.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sometimes, God will give me an instruction that sounds childish during our Holy Ghost Services. Because I am a child in His hands, I will tell the people what He says, and those who are not too big to obey the childish instruction will come back to testify about how they got their miracle after obeying Him. One time, God told me to call out all those who had back pains and dance around them. That was a very childish thing to do, but I obeyed, and when I was done, their back pains had disappeared, and they could all bend over to touch their toes conveniently.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are too proud to submit to a man of God, you cannot get a miracle through him. If you are too big to carry out an instruction because it seems beneath your social status, you cannot get a miracle. You must humble yourself before the Most High God if you want to enjoy His miracles. It amazes me that people consult doctors in humility, answering all their questions and surrendering their bodies for examination and treatment, but when they come to God, they act in a proud manner as if they know more than Him.</p>",

There was no humanly possible solution to their problem, yet they turned to a fellow human, Moses, for help. Thank God Moses was wise enough to turn to God because, at crossroads like that, the only way out is the way God provides.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In situations like the one the Israelites were in, you should face God and say, “Lord, this Red Sea must part. I will not let You go except You make a way for me.” Those are not times for gentlemanly prayers; they are times for violent prayers such that God will know that you will not rest until you get a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I remember one time that I was in such a situation. I lay flat on the road in the middle of the night at Redemption City, crying to God desperately for help. When there is a serious problem and there is no way out, I hold on to God in prayers, and I don't let go until He parts the sea and makes a way for me.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Matthew 15:22-28, the Canaanite woman knew that the only solution to her daughter's problem was with Jesus, so she did not let anything deter her; she pestered Him until she got what she wanted. The woman with the issue of blood had gone to all the doctors in the land and spent all her money, yet the illness remained. She knew that the only way out of her problem was to make contact with Jesus, so even though the crowd was great and she was weak from all the bleeding, she pressed through until she touched Him and got her healing.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Maybe the reason some Christians are relaxed in the place of prayer is that they cannot see how close the enemy is to them. Maybe they cannot see that the devil is doing all he can to win the battle over them. Beloved, don't wait until it is too late; pray now! Don't condone that problem any further; deal with it now. Stop thinking that your solution is with any man when only God can help you. If you call on Him to make a way for you where there is no way, He will do it. Are you ready to pray now?</p>",

      "<p>The Bible says that a man cannot take fire in his&nbsp;bosom and not be burnt (Proverbs 6:27). Fire in this context is sin. If a believer is allowing sin or an appearance of sin around him or her, he or she is taking fire in his or her bosom and will eventually be burned.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I learned from Joseph's story that when the devil is determined to bring a man down, he will position temptation around him such that he will keep seeing it continually. He knows that if the temptation is right in front of the fellow every day, it is only a matter of time before he falls. This is why I have always told my children that they must not have a secretary or personal assistant who is of the opposite sex. It is better not to bring the temptation anywhere near you than to believe that you can resist it.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>A common adage in Yoruba land says, if you will not eat it, don't smell it. If a man has been asking you for a relationship that you know will lead to sin, why are you still answering his calls? If you are always tempted to steal, why will you agree to help your group or department keep the money they have contributed? You must stay far from whatever you know can lead you to sin because the devil is described as a serpent. A serpent is very subtle and cunning. As dangerous as it is, it can crawl right beside you without you realising it. You may have sworn that you will never do something, but if you allow that thing around you, the devil will cunningly get you to do it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The elders say that it is through an opening in a wall that the lizard gains entrance into the house. When you give room to temptation around you, you have opened up the wall of your soul, and it is only a matter of time before sin creeps in. Unfriend that friend who always suggests sinful things, relocate from that area where you are more susceptible to committing sin, delete whatever is on your phone that can lead you to sin, and just do whatever it takes to get sin&nbsp;far away from you. It is better to lose these things and make it to heaven than to retain them and go to hell.</p>",

Such students may be helping their peers, but really, they are helping themselves more.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you tell your friends and family about Jesus, seeking to save their souls, it is out of love because you don't want them to burn in hell. However, the more you preach the gospel, the more grounded you will become in Christ. Firstly, you will see miracles happen (Mark 16:15-18), and this will make your faith even more real to you. Secondly, the Holy Spirit will inspire you on what to say when you preach. Believe me, some of the things I say on the altar are new to me. These revelations, because they came through me, have a better rooting in me than in anyone else. Thirdly, a fellow who preaches the gospel and makes disciples has one more reason not to backslide no matter how tough the temptations get because he wouldn't want the disciples to see him backsliding.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Being the General Overseer of the RCCG is a sacrificial role that God gave to me, but it has also helped me stand stronger in the faith.

      "<p>Miracles happen when God suspends one or&nbsp;more laws of nature. For example, when Jesus walked on water, He suspended the law of gravity. Many times, it is difficult to explain a miracle to someone who does not know God because you will be trying to explain how a law of nature suddenly lost its effect. The good news, however, is that it does not matter what the world may say; my Daddy is the miracle-working God, and miracles happen when He steps into a matter.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In 2 Kings 6:1-7, when the sons of the prophets were cutting wood so they could build a bigger dwelling place for themselves, the axe head that one of them was using fell into the water, and he cried to Elisha. The young man cried because he knew that, according to the law of nature, when a heavy metal like an axe head drops in the water, it will sink to the bottom. He also knew that no one amongst them could swim to the bottom of the water to pick up the axe head. He thought he was finished, but thankfully, he called on a representative of the Miracle Worker on Earth for help. The moment the Miracle Worker was introduced to the situation, hope came. All Elisha did was to simply reverse the law of nature. He put a little stick into the water, it went to the bottom of the river, and the heavy axe head swam to the surface. The Miracle Worker will reverse any law of nature to bring hope to every hopeless situation in your life or around you today, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Do you need a miracle? Are you in a situation where you know that the only way out is if God intervenes? All you need to do is cry out to Him today. Don't try to work things out on your own; take out time to cry to Him until you hear a word from Him. Doctors are helpless when faced with incurable diseases, but with The Great Physician, no disease is incurable. If the body part is so damaged that it cannot be repaired, He will simply replace it because He is the manufacturer. Some financial situations are so terrible that the best finance consultants cannot solve them, but my God can bring money out of the mouth of a fish to solve financial problems.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, call on Him today and let Him work a miracle in your life.</p>",

      "<p>Many Christians complain that things are not going well for them even though it has been a while since they confessed Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour. The question I often ask such Christians is, “Since you received Jesus Christ into your life, have you been living by His principles?” It is a good thing to have Jesus in your life, however, you must ensure that you also live by His principles if you want to experience positive changes in all aspects of your life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>No matter how spiritual you are, certain principles must be applied for certain things to work in your life. For example, the Bible says that he that does not work should not eat (2 Thessalonians 3:10). No matter how prayerful you are, if you are lazy, you may not escape poverty (Proverbs 6:10- 11).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Shortly after I became born again, tapes of many pastors teaching the power of positive confession were circulating around the Christian community. They would say things like, “You will become whomever you say you are. Just confess good; say what you want to see in your life.” Although this message is correct, many took it the wrong way. Lazy Christians continued being lazy, while the uneducated ones did not pursue education to enhance their ability to earn. They all just kept confessing, “I am rich, I am not poor,” “I am a landlord, I will never beg,” and so on, but nothing changed in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you want change, you must adopt the principles of God. One of His principles is in Luke 6:38; if you don't sow seeds, you shouldn't expect a harvest. Being stingy and yet praying for God to bless you is like being a farmer who did not plant any seed but who goes to his farm every morning to pray that yams should grow there. During the season of harvest, when he digs the ground to get yams, he will find nothing there because he planted nothing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some other principles of God which I will like to mention are: Do unto others what you want them to do to you (Matthew 7:12), exercise control over your mouth (Psalm 141:3) and your appetite (Proverbs 23:1-3), let others praise you, don't praise yourself (Proverbs 27:2), always do things in steps, start small and grow from there (Zechariah 4:10), whatever you embark on, ensure that you plan properly for it to be achieved successfully (Luke 14:28). These and many more are principles of life that may not necessarily lead you to hell if they are not practised, but will definitely help you to live a better life on earth if they are.</p>",

If there is anything mathematics teaches you, it is that certain formulas will only work if you meet certain conditions. For example, in a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides will be equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This will always be true, whether on Earth or on the moon. It is foolish for anyone to try to get certain results without first meeting the necessary conditions. Even Jesus Christ had to be baptised by John the Baptist to fulfil one of the conditions for success in His assignment on Earth (Matthew 3:15).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Do you know that there are many people whose breakthroughs have already been released by God, but they are yet to experience it? The door they have been asking God to open was already opened a long time ago; God is only waiting for them to do what they need to do to walk in. Unfortunately, many people are wasting the answers to their prayers just because they refuse to obey simple principles. I have always told my children, even though the Almighty God had said that Sarah would give birth to a son for Abraham and had quickened their dead bodies according to Romans 4:19, if Abraham had not been intimate with her, Isaac would never have been born. Many miracles have already been released by God to many of His children, but instead of them to do what they need to do to get the miracle, they are being mis-spiritual. By mis-spiritual, I mean spirituality in the wrong direction. Can you imagine a couple looking for the fruit of the womb not being intimate with each other, but observing prayer vigils daily? Or a student who has not studied at all, praying all night to pass an exam that is slated for 7am in the morning?&nbsp;</p><p><br>True spirituality does not suspend the senses; in fact, true spirituality births wisdom because wisdom is a gift of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:8).&nbsp;</p><p><br>I pray for you today, mis-spirituality will not be your portion, in Jesus' name.

      "<p>When you consider the word 'husband,' you will see its similarity with the word 'husbandry'. Husbandry has to do with caring for and cultivating crops and livestock. This gives us insight into the duty of husbands; they are to tend their wives like gardens for their potential to blossom. They should nurture their potential and make them more beautiful and fruitful than when they met them. People admire some men's wives because those men tend their gardens well. The way a man tends his garden is a reflection of the kind of person he is.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Gardens bring beauty to homes; if a garden is fruitful, then the family will be nourished with healthy fruits, vegetables, and fresh air. However, if a garden is filled with thorns, a lot of pain and parasites will exist in that home. Many married men who are always miserable and sad often complain about their wives not making them happy. Their wives can't make them happy when they are sad and miserable; it is only what they receive that they can give. If you're a husband, what you should put in your wife is what you want. Take care of her and make her happy; she will make you happy too. Before you buy a shirt for yourself, buy a dress for her. If you call her a witch and maltreat her, know that you made her one because when you were courting, you were calling her an angel. It is after she entered your house that she became a witch.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Another definition of husbandry, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is the management and conservation of resources. Many husbands don't seem to see anything special in their wives; those are bad husbands. A good husband will see the potentials in his wife in the form of her talents and giftings and will help her manage them properly to yield the best results. As a husband, in managing your wife's resources, you should also manage her excesses and shortcomings; that is the aspect of weeding in husbandry. Those shortcomings will try to hinder her talents from blossoming, but it is your duty to identify them and reduce them to the barest minimum.&nbsp;</p><p><br>A good husband does not complain about his wife's shortcomings; he manages them to ensure they don't stop her gifts from blossoming. A good husband will patiently work with his wife to overcome her shortcomings and enhance her talents. The great women out there also have their shortcomings, but thank God they have good husbands. They are great achievers notwithstanding and are making their husbands proud today.</p>",

Let us examine some of the answers that the Bible gives us concerning this:&nbsp;</p><p><br>1. He came to call sinners to repentance. Matthew 9:13 says, <i><strong>“But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>2. He came to give eternal life. John 10:10 says, <i><strong>"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>3. He came to heal, deliver and set the captives free. Luke 4:18 says,<i><strong> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,”</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>4. To destroy the works of the devil. 1 John 3:8 says, <i><strong>"… For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>Considering these scriptural references about Jesus\' purpose for coming into this world, has His coming had any impact on your life? If you cannot answer this question clearly, then you need to invite Jesus into your life, even if you have done so before. Surrender your life completely to Him today and make a commitment to live holy going forward. This way, the purpose of Jesus coming to the earth as a man will be fulfilled in your life, and you will live above sicknesses, diseases, captivity, and the works of the devil. You will enjoy abundant and eternal life in Christ Jesus.</p>',

Such persons can never be affected by curses that are pronounced on them. No matter how hard he tries, there is absolutely nothing the devil can do to curse the fellow that God has blessed. Romans 8:31 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>God is Almighty; if He is on your side, there is no force on the earth, underneath the earth, or in any other place that can work against you. The Bible says that you have been bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:20) and that price is the blood of Jesus. This means that no one can touch you because you are God's possession. Through the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus flowing inside you, you are irreversibly blessed. God has blessed you with all heavenly blessings, and there is no man that can curse you! Numbers 23:23 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>In Proverbs 26:2, you are reassured that:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>If someone decides to curse you without a genuine cause, do not be moved and do not be afraid. Goliath cursed David and, in a few minutes, his head was in David's hands. In fact, any fellow who tries to curse you needs your prayers because God's word says in Genesis 12:3:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: …&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br><i><strong>﻿</strong></i>What is that genuine cause that can make a curse active even on a believer? It is sin. After Balaam could not curse the people of Israel because they were blessed, they were tricked into sleeping with strange women, and before they knew it, they were cursed with diseases. If you want to be blessed beyond curses, after surrendering your life to Jesus, you must ensure that you live holy. A life without Jesus does not have protection against any curse. As long as you remain a child of God, you are untouchable to curses.</p>",

Before you go, you must first book an appointment. If the president asks you to come by 2pm and you get there early, you may still not be allowed to see him until 5pm because the president is busy. At times, it is the president who needs you, but you still must wait. No president is as busy as God, yet He is always available to give you His undivided attention whenever you call on Him – He is never too busy.&nbsp;<br>Jesus said that whenever we come to God in prayers, we should come in His name. I can send you to someone and give you a signed note asking the fellow to give you what you want. However, when I say you should go in my name, what I mean is that, even though you are the one going there, when you arrive at the gate, tell them it is Adeboye who has arrived. When the people see you, they are to receive you and treat you as if I am the one they are welcoming.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jesus asking you to pray to the Father in His name means that even though you are the one praying, the Father is to see that prayer point as if He prayed it. Since Jesus and the Father are one (John 10:30), it also implies that whatever the Father owns, the Son owns also, so as the Father will not refuse to give Jesus whatever He asks for, He will also not refuse to give you whatever you ask for according to His will.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If Jesus appears to you and tells you that the moment you ask Him for anything, you will get it, will you stay silent or start asking for whatever you need? He already told you in John 16:23 that if you ask Him for anything, He will give it to you. This is why you should pray for everything you need. Many people complain about things they can change by simply praying. Jesus is waiting to give you whatever you ask Him for.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't be worried about anything; just pray in Jesus’ name, and the problem is solved (John 14:13-14).</p>",

      "<p>When you spray a fire extinguisher over fire, it dies off. In the same vein, certain things act as prayer extinguishers. If such things exist in our lives, we will not get answers to our prayers because the prayers will die off before they get to God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sin is the first thing that extinguishes our prayers the moment they leave our lips. David said in Psalm 66:18:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>If sin is in your heart, it will extinguish your prayer, and God will not hear it, even if you scream aloud while praying. In Isaiah 59:1-2, the Bible says that sin creates such a huge distance between God and us that He cannot hear us nor can His hand reach us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Even when a genuine man of God prays for a sinner, the prayer will be extinguished by the sins of that sinner unless he or she repents. Many years ago, when the congregation was not as large as it is now, and I could lay hands on everyone, a woman came to one of our Holy Ghost Services. She had been married for many years without a child and had been told that I have a special anointing for making the barren fruitful. I laid hands on her during the service, and she fell under the anointing. However, months after that, she still did not conceive. She came back complaining, “They told me that when you lay hands on me, I will fall, and then I will become fruitful, but up to now, there is still no child”. I thought she needed an extra dose of the anointing and was about to pray for her again when God told me, “Son, ask her how many boyfriends she has.” It was hard to ask her the question, but I managed to mumble the words. She replied that she had six boyfriends. I exclaimed, “Ah! And you expect my God to answer your prayer?” Yes, I prayed for her and laid hands on her, but her sin extinguished the prayers.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Check yourself before you pray to be sure that you don't have any sin in your heart because if sin is present, your prayers will go to waste. Repent of the sin first, then you can be sure that God will answer your prayers. The only prayer that God will hear from a sinner is the prayer of repentance from sin because as long as sin exists in his or her life, God will not hear him or her (Isaiah 59:1-2).</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I discussed how sin can extinguish our prayers. Another prayer extinguisher is - not praying according to God’s will. You must understand that God has a plan for your life and wants to bring you to an expected end (Jeremiah 29:11). This means that God already has an expectation about you before you were born. Thus, everything He does, including the prayers He answers, is to bring you to that expected end. You cannot pray for God to do something against His will and expect Him to do it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many people have said, “I have been asking God for a particular thing for so long without an answer.” Where they are probably getting it wrong is that they are not checking if what they are asking for aligns with God's will or if it's just for their selfish lusts (James 4:3). Asking for something outside God's will is asking amiss; such prayers are extinguished, and God will not grant such requests. This is why you must be intimate with the Holy Spirit. Romans 8:26 says that we do not know how to pray because, many-a-times, we don't know the will of the Father. However, the Holy Spirit can help you to pray exactly what the will of the Father is, and then your prayers will be attended to.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you pray in tongues, you are praying very accurate prayers because the Holy Spirit is praying the will of the Father through you. Imagine that you are friends with the son of the chairman of a company, and you apply for a job in that company, using an application letter that was written by a director in the company, and having the chairman's son, who is also a director, as your referee. When your application gets to the chairman's table, he will not be able to ignore it because it will contain the exact things that relate to the organisation and the role you are applying for, and also because his son is your referee. You will surely have the job because your application will contain exactly what is on the chairman's mind, and you have a good relationship with his son.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>If you don't want your prayers extinguished, let the Holy Spirit pray through you as you maintain an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ in whose name you are praying. The best prayer points are the ones generated for you by the Holy Spirit.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will conclude my discussion on some of the factors that can extinguish prayers. Some people get almost everything right in the place of prayer but miss out on just one thing – faith. Today's memory verse says that believers should always make their requests to God in faith without having any doubts in their hearts. The next verse directly addresses anyone who makes requests from God without faith:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. </strong></i>James 1:7&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you pray without faith, that prayer is dead on arrival.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Believers cannot expect God to answer their prayers when He is not pleased with them. God requires that you have faith in Him when you ask Him for something. Luke 17:6 says that even if your faith is as little as a mustard seed, God will use it to move mountains on your behalf. If your child asks you for food and then looks at you in such a way that says, “I know you will not give me; you probably don't even have it,” you will feel insulted. This is what we do when we ask God for things that we are not really expecting Him to give to us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you come to God in faith, you come knowing without a doubt that what you have asked of Him is already done. You bring your requests with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6) because you know that your prayer has already been answered. The moment you pray, your hands are already stretched out to God, expecting what you asked for. This is how to pray; it is the kind of prayer that God cannot ignore. Hebrews 11:1 says that faith is the evidence of things not seen. In other words, when you have faith, even though you have not seen what you are asking for, you will be so sure that you have it that you can present it in court as evidence to any judge, telling them, “See what I have.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>For a long time, I tried by my own power to increase my faith, but it was difficult. Then, I read Mark 9:24, where a man cried to Jesus, saying that he believes but that Jesus should help his unbelief. In minutes, what Jesus was asking him to believe for was done. I also started praying that God should help my faith, and I have seen my faith grow tremendously since then. If you pray the same prayer, Jesus will give your faith a boost, and you will be able to overcome unbelief.</p>",

When you pray about your country, for example, and later join others in saying that nothing good can come out of that same country, you have contaminated your prayer already.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't pray for God to give life to something and then turn around to speak death into that same thing; you will not get results from such a prayer. Joel 3:10 says, “Let the weak say, 'I am strong!'” In other words, if you have prayed for strength, but can still see traces of weakness in you, at that point, say, “I am strong”. As your words go in line with your prayers, they will remain potent enough to deliver the results you seek. When you pray about something, it is important that your words and thoughts agree with your prayer. This way, you will not stand in the way of the answer to your prayer.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Another thing that contaminates prayers is a lack of concentration while praying. This is when people pray, but their hearts are not in the prayer. Rather, their minds are occupied with other things. The devil knows that if your mind is distracted while praying, your prayer will not carry as much power as it should. Therefore, whenever you decide to pray, he will begin to remind you of things you are yet to do and places that you ought to have gone to. His plan is to occupy your mind with other things so that you will become distracted and lose your concentration as you pray. Whenever you find your mind wandering while praying, write down the things that you ought to have done, put the note aside, and continue to pray. Train your mind to keep all distractions away, and don't give room for them to disturb your connection to God in the place of prayer. With time, as you continually train your mind, you will get good at focusing on God while praying.</p>",

It was generally believed that he single-handedly protected the town from all forms of evil, and he was feared by all. When we wanted to open the RCCG parish in my village, the place we found suitable for a rally was close to Kaka's house. Surprisingly, when an altar call was made during the rally, Kaka came out of his house to give his life to Christ – he had been listening to the worship session and sermon. Later that night, he came to my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, and said, “The way you spoke about your God, He must be really powerful.” Papa said, “Very, very powerful.” Kaka said, “In that case, now that I have given my life to Jesus, I would need help with an idol in my house called shigidi. It is an effigy that has been in my family for generations and that we send out at night when we want to kill someone. It is so dangerous that we must not sleep until it returns, and we must kill a ram to welcome it. Upon its return, it will step on the ram's blood and drink it. Thereafter, it will return to its position and become just like an ordinary effigy. I am afraid of the trouble that might follow if I throw shigidi away.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>Papa decided to send me over to remove the effigy. I went to Kaka's house with the pastor of our parish in Ilesha and a church worker that I thought to be a strong prayer warrior. When Kaka saw me, he felt sorry for me, “Ahhh, Adeboye's son, you are the one they sent?” When my colleagues saw shigidi, they ran out of the house, leaving me alone with the effigy. It was smeared with blood and adorned with all manner of charms. I said a prayer, broke the effigy into pieces, removed the shrine in front of the house, and threw everything into a river. After three weeks, I returned to my village and visited Kaka at home. When he saw me, he shouted, “You are still alive?!” That was 1975. I am still alive almost five decades after.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, the devil and his demons are under the feet of even the smallest child of God.

      "<p>The way people respond to failures determines whether they will eventually live in victory or not. Failure is not as bad as people paint it to be; it does not signify the end, but it is a signal to try again using a different method. Almost all scientific breakthroughs result from failure. If most scientists became sad and stopped after the first time they failed, they would never have had breakthroughs. Every successful person you see is a product of many failures. If you try today and fail, rise up and try again in a different way. As long as you are sure that what you are doing is in line with the will of God, don't give up on it; keep trying until you succeed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In today's Bible reading, the Israelites asked God if they should go to battle against the Benjamites and if they would win. God told them to fight and that they would win. However, when they got to the battlefield, they were defeated. The question on their minds would have been, “Did God deceive us?” They refused to give up, got themselves together, and went to ask God again if they should return to battle the Benjamites. God told them to go, and once again, the Benjamites defeated them. At that point, giving up would have seemed reasonable; they had already lost 40,000 men, and it looked as if God, the only one they could trust, was deceiving them. If they had given up, they would have been commended for trying, but they did not give up. They went back to God, and this time, they fasted and gave offerings to God. They asked again if they should return to fight the Benjamites, and God said that they should go. They went, and as you read in the story, they used a different strategy and were able to defeat the Benjamites. Don't give up; your breakthrough is probably just around the corner. Try once again.</p><p><br>When next you encounter failure, ask yourself, “Why is God letting me go through this?” If you have been consistent with your prayer life and walk with God, ask, “What can I learn from this experience? What is God trying to teach me with this failure? Are there other strategies to achieve my goal?” If you answer these questions sincerely, you will draw valuable lessons that will help you achieve success the next time you try.</p>",

      "<p>I discussed handling failure properly yesterday. factor that can affect success in life; there is also the need to learn how to handle success correctly. Many people have eventually failed in life because they did not know how to handle their success.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In 1957, a man won £75,000 in a lottery. In those days, you could buy a flat in London for a tiny fraction of that sum. One day in the early 1980s, somewhere in Western Nigeria, I saw a man that was wearing rags, sitting beside a building that had collapsed in half. I asked the fellow who was driving me, “Who is that fellow?” He said, “That is the man who won £75,000 in 1957.” The man had great prosperity but did not know how to handle it, so he ended up poor. A popular proverb inspired by Proverbs 21:20 says that a fool and his prosperity are soon separated. If a fellow is not wise enough to handle success, it can turn out to be the beginning of great failure.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't get over-excited when success comes. Many people start rejoicing and partying after a victory, forgetting that the devil never relaxes. What actually happens is that the devil becomes more determined to bring such people down. Don't miss prayer meetings or your personal devotion because you are celebrating a victory. Yes, you won the battle, but the enemy is not dead yet; he is still roaming, looking for whom to devour (1 Peter 5:8). You should increase your commitment to God after every victory and not the other way around.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil knows that after successes, people are likely to relax, so he usually attacks them during such periods. After David killed Goliath, he raised King Saul up against him. It was after Elijah called down fire from heaven that Jezebel swore to kill him (1 Kings 19:1-3). When you attain success in a particular thing, you must not relax. You must remain alert and ready for battle. Don't let success distract you from the end goal that God has called you to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One great success we had in RCCG was a programme called Lekki '98, where over six million people gathered in one place to worship God. Immediately after that programme, we doubled our missionary efforts, sending missionaries to new territories. We immediately started planning the next edition of the programme, and today, we have held much bigger programmes because we doubled our efforts and did not relax after our success.</p>",

On her wedding day, the local police raided the missionary base and arrested her in her wedding dress. She kissed the handcuffs they put on her and said, “Lord, I didn't know you were so jealous over me and wouldn't let me marry anyone else. How beautiful is your wedding ring to me!” She was so in love with Christ that her wedding being invaded meant nothing to her; she saw the handcuffs as wedding rings. That is the kind of intimacy you must have with Christ so as not to deny Him in the face of persecution.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When people compromise after facing a little persecution, like not being promoted at work because of their Christian values, I shake my head because I know that they were never really rooted in Christ. Christians who are truly rooted in Christ rejoice when they are persecuted because they know they are blessed (Matthew 5:10-12). They see persecution as a sign that they are a terror to the devil, and that excites them; they want to cause him even more terror. Persecution drives them to do more for God against the kingdom of darkness. In Acts 5:41, the disciples rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for Jesus' name. In 1 Peter 4:13, we are told to rejoice that we are partakers of Christ's sufferings. Don't let persecution weigh you down; let it become fuel for you to do more for God.</p>",

      "<p>Oppositions are different from persecutions.&nbsp;Persecution happens when someone attacks you because you are a Christian, while oppositions happen when you are attacked in a bid to stop you from doing whatever you have planned to do for God. Many people have set out to do things for God and were faced with opposition that made them back down. Some of them remained fervent Christians, but the opposition discouraged them from going ahead to do what was in their hearts for God. If we allow oppositions to stop us from doing what God has called us to do, many souls will perish in hell, and the devil will oppress people because the Christians are quiet. Therefore, rather than allow oppositions to stop you, you must learn to keep going despite them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One man who faced opposition and kept going until the work was done was Nehemiah. He had set out to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, despite the fact that it was not going to be an easy task – then, opposition arose. If you study the book of Nehemiah, you will see the three major tools of opposition that the devil employs against Christians: mockery (Nehemiah 4:3), threats (Nehemiah 4:7-8) and discouragement (Nehemiah 4:10). He can raise people to mock you for what you are doing, but you must ignore them. Some people will threaten you with many things or even death if you continue to do what you are doing for God. However, you should not be afraid because God will take care of such people for you. Lastly, the devil can bring discouragement by making the work more difficult. He can do it by ensuring the unavailability of resources or some people's refusal to cooperate with you. Whether the devil brings one or all of these things your way, if God has given you a vision, you must never back down.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. </strong></i>Nehemiah 4:9</p><p><br>Nehemiah's default response to all the opposition he faced was to pray. Prayer is not a last resort but your primary defence against oppositions. As you do all that you humanly can to forestall oppositions, put your trust in God. Place your ears on His chest to hear the next instruction He will give you; after all, you are doing His work. The people opposing you are actually opposing Him, so let Him do the fighting while you keep working.</p>",

If you are a leader in the body of Christ whom God has placed over some of His sheep, you must ensure that you preserve them by feeding them with the accurate word of God and protecting them from false teachers who are actually wolves in sheep's clothing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Acts 20:28, shepherds are told sternly to feed the flock in their care. If you are not teaching the people that God has put in your care the true and complete word of God, you are killing them spiritually, and God will not spare you for that. No human being can live long if he/she is malnourished, so also, the souls of the people in your care will perish if they are malnourished. As you teach them prosperity, also teach them holiness. As you teach them about Christ's love, don’t leave out the fact that He is also the consuming fire. Don’t worry about the church's growth, do what God has called you to do, and He will grow His church.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The apostles regularly warned the sheep about false teachers and their teachings (2 Corinthians 11:13-15, 2 Peter 2:1). They were protecting them from wolves, and we must do the same. There are all sorts of doctrines going around these days that are completely opposite to God's word. Don't ignore them; tell your people never to listen to such teachings. If you don’t tell them to stay away from such teachings because you don’t want to offend anyone, you will leave them to be devoured by wolves.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Social media has created many opportunities for false teachers to confuse some of the sheep with their teachings. The sheep may see someone working miracles and believe that he or she is a genuine minister of God. They might start listening to the fellow's teachings, so you must ensure that what they are listening to is not the lure of a wolf. Teach your followers to be like the Berean Christians who always checked any teaching they heard against the word of God (Acts 17:10-11).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Whether you are a pastor, head of a department, house fellowship leader, or parent, if you have been placed as a spiritual leader over some people, it is your responsibility to ensure that the devil does not devour them.</p>",

You must know who you are, and you can only know this when you see yourself the way God sees you. How does God see you?&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are confronted by a situation that seems tough and the devil is trying to tell you that you will not win, remember what the Bible says in Romans 8:37: <i><strong>“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.”</strong></i> Even though that situation may have conquered some people in the past, it cannot conquer you because you are more than a conqueror through Christ who loved you and loves you forever. Sometimes, the devil will tell you that you are not good enough to be at the top or achieve your goals. Laugh and quote Deuteronomy 28:13 to him: <i><strong>“And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath;…”</strong></i> The Bible says that you will be above only, so there is no space for you at the bottom; the only space available for you as a child of God is above, and you will take your place, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil can say whatever he wants, but when you know the truth, you will not listen to him or accept his lies. When you know the real you in Christ, you will ignore whatever the devil says because you know that he is a liar (John 8:44). As you ignore him, your actions and thoughts will also follow suit. You will not let his lies dictate what you do or what you don't. His words must not shape your thoughts concerning what you believe about yourself or not.&nbsp;<br>The devil is too small to control the thoughts and actions of a believer.

The most dangerous thing about it is that it is not specifically listed amongst the works of the flesh in Galatians 5:19-21, and so many Christians are not careful of it. Also, many people think that peer pressure only applies to teenagers, but it is also present among older people. For example, when you go to a wedding, and you join your peers in dancing to worldly songs because you don't want them to see you sitting aside, that is peer pressure making you do something against God's will. You cannot please God and man at the same time. King Saul tried to please men, and he displeased God as a result. He lost his throne and died a shameful death (1 Samuel 31:1- 6).</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Don't try to dress like the world because you don't want to seem 'left out'. Don't try to use dirty slangs to show that you are also familiar with current trends. Many years ago, I was a guest minister somewhere, and when the man of God who was to introduce me went to the altar to do the introduction, he said that he liked everything about me except the way I dressed like a hunter with my short-sleeved suits. I replied that I am not a hunter, I am a soldier. His remarks did not make me change the way I dress, even though my colleagues were wearing flowing agbada around that time. Today, God has raised me very high amongst my colleagues. Children of God are not influenced by peer pressure; they are led by the Spirit of God (Romans 8:14). When a Christian starts doing things because of what people will say or think, such a believer has stopped being led by the Spirit of God, and the fellow is already losing his or her sonship.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The word of God says in 2 Corinthians 6:17 that you must be separate. If people are to be seen as your peers, let them be people who have separated themselves for Christ. Amongst these people, you can bow to the peer pressure of who is praying the longest, who has memorized more Scriptures, who wins the most number of souls per day, et cetera. That is the only kind of peer pressure that is good for a Christian; pressure to please God more and draw closer to Him, not pressure that relates to carnal things.</p>",

Anyone who allows envy into his or her heart is only a few steps away from harbouring many other evils. Cain did not have any intention to murder his brother until envy came into his heart. They must have been very close, but the day envy crept into his heart, it opened up the door to the thought of murdering his brother. In Numbers 16:1-33, Korah and his group rose against Moses because they envied his position and were swallowed up by the earth. When you see someone with something that you would like to have, rather than envy them, be happy for them. Romans 12:15 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</strong></p><p><br>If someone is doing better than you in business, ministry, or whatever, don't envy them, rejoice with them instead.

This is why you shouldn't allow any feeling of envy to linger and take root in your heart. The moment you catch yourself feeling envious of a fellow, work on your mind to expel that envy by replacing it with joy. To work on your mind, you can ask God to help you not to feel envious. You can also start praying for that fellow because it will really get the devil angry as he is pointing out things for you to be envious of, but instead of getting envious, you are praying for the fellow. He will stop trying to get you to be envious after that.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you allow envy into your heart, you are opening the door for destruction.

When a child gets to his father's house and sees that things are not placed where they should be, he or she naturally starts putting things right. However, when a visitor comes into that same house, he or she will simply find a place to sit and remain there. If you see God as your father, whenever you get to His house, you will do whatever you can to make things work smoothly. You wouldn't go to your father's house and not care about the outlook and advancement of the place.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are many benefits of being a worker in God's house. One of them is stated in 2 Timothy 2:6:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Because you are a husbandman, one who is cultivating the land to produce fruits for everyone, you will be the first partaker of those fruits. In other words, when you work to make services run smoothly, you will be the first partaker of the blessings and miracles that happen in those services. No one works for God without getting a reward. Hebrews 6:10 says it clearly:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>God will never forget whatever labour you do out of love for Him. God decreed in Leviticus 19:13 that no labourer must be denied his or her wages. Do you think He will not reward you for working directly with Him? Your wages when you work for Him include protection, provision, a sound mind, deliverance, speedy answers to prayers, and a whole lot more. While it is fine for a church to employ or pay professionals for some services, I always tell church members who are adamant about charging a fee for rendering any service without being employed by the church that they shouldn't expect anything from God again, as they cannot get paid twice for the same service. As a worker in a church, once you insist on getting paid money for any service you render in the church, you have made yourself a hireling in His house and not a child.</p>",

However, you cannot get close to God if you don't sit alone with your Bible to study it and spend time alone with Him in prayers; this is your personal devotion time.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God relates with individuals, not groups. Even in a group, when God wants to talk, He addresses Himself to individuals. For example, He was talking to all members of the church in a city when He said, <i><strong>“Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.”</strong></i> (Revelations 3:20). Though God was talking to the entire church, He used singular pronouns. This is why many-a-times, when I am ministering, and God wants to give someone a miracle, He will say through me, “There is someone here…”. Two or three people may get their miracle from that proclamation, but He addressed each of them separately. God wants to have an individual relationship with you. The relationship your pastor, parent or Bible Study leader has with Him does not apply to you; He wants to connect with you personally, and until He has built a personal connection with you, you cannot really know Him.&nbsp;</p><p><br>To build this personal connection with God, you must have a personal altar. This is a place and/or time when you meet with Him daily. You must set aside a time every day to study your Bible and pray. You will discover as you start having personal time with Him that there will always be an ongoing conversation between yourself and Him every time, either on something He is teaching you or something that you are trying to understand as you study your Bible. Your altar is not a place you come to only when you need something from Him, it is a place you come to regularly to build a personal relationship with Him.</p>",

      "<p>For many Christians, when they are having a dispute born again. As they don't seem to like a fellow or the fellow doesn't like them, they treat him or her badly. Jesus Christ said in Luke 6:35 that you must not only love your enemies, you should also be kind to them. When you know the right things to do for people, whether you are on good terms with them or not, do it. The Bible says that it is sinful for you to know something good that you are supposed to do and not do it. James 4:17 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Don't victimise someone with your position because the person is not your friend. Whether you are the one who is right or not does not matter, the moment you decide to victimise them, you become the one who is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In the Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ said clearly that you are not to repay evil with evil, rather, you are to repay evil with good. The reason for this is that He does not want your heart to abhor any form of corruption or evil at all. Apostle Paul said that when you decide to avenge yourself or repay evil for evil, you are letting evil overcome you. Romans 12:20-21 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Scripture above says that you should love, care for, and even provide for those that hate you. You shouldn't relate with people based on whether they love you or not or on how they treat you; you should relate with them based on how God wants you to. Don't let evil overcome you in a bid to repay someone or show them how powerful you are. If evil overcomes you, it means that you are now on the side of the devil as opposed to the side of God. I will conclude this teaching with the words of Apostle Paul in Romans 12:18:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</strong></i></p>",

      "<p>The Bible makes it plain that God values work. Whether you're a full-time parent, bus driver, artist, or engineer, God is concerned about your work, as long as what you do for a living is legitimate. Work is a major component of God's overall plan for man. In the Garden of Eden, after God made man, He told him to tend the garden (Genesis 2:15). This means that any man that does not work is malfunctioning because man was made to work.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The value of work is inherent. Work gives pleasure, which is why some retired people are still working even after their retirement. There is no pleasure in just sitting around from morning until night-time, doing nothing. Many wealthy people fall into depression when they feel like they have made a lot of money and don't need to work anymore. There is no pleasure in accomplishing nothing. For example, when you work on a garden, you will get a lot of pleasure when you see the fruits in that garden begin to blossom.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The memory verse for today says that God will give every man according to the fruit of his doings, so if a fellow does nothing, he or she will get nothing. This is why 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>The reason God gave you talents is so that you can put them to work. If a believer does not use his or her talents, he or she will answer to God on the last day (Matthew 25:14-30). God cannot condone laziness at all. John 5:17 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br>If God is working, He will not allow you to be lazy. My God is not a God of lazy people. If a believer is lazy and is asking God for blessings, He will ignore such a believer. Working hard is a godly value, and laziness is ungodly. You cannot claim to be a Christian and yet be lazy. Even if you are unemployed, pray to God and find something that you can do to contribute positively to the society, no matter how small it may be. From doing this, God will open greater doors for you. You cannot afford to lie around doing nothing; it is against God's plan for you.</p>",

Though His disciples called Him 'Master,' He was humble enough to wash their dirty feet. Can you wash the feet of those you are leading? When there is plenty of work to be done, can you take the lowest of all the work?&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are people who somehow get to the top without serving, but before long, they will lose their position if they refuse to serve. Some years ago, we held a camp meeting at a secondary school when the students were on holiday. We arrived at the school, and I went to check the toilets. They were an eyesore as there were faeces everywhere. I told my team how horrible the toilets were and that we had to wash them in preparation for those that would be attending the camp meeting. I intentionally chose the dirtiest of all the toilets and washed it. When the rest of the team saw me washing the toilet, they were moved to wash the other toilets. When we were building the first auditorium at Redemption City, some church members would come to the building site when they had closed from their offices to help out with the construction work as we did not have enough money to pay labourers. Every single evening, I worked with them, carrying cement and doing every other thing that needed to be done even though I was the General Overseer. This is how I have remained at the top – by serving.</p>",

      "<p>When you read Bible verses like 1 Corinthians 6:20, which says that you have been bought with a price, you might begin to wonder, “Bought from who? When did I consent to being owned by someone else which warranted buying me off that fellow?” This expression in itself tells us that every human being, whether they know it or not, and regardless of how they feel about it, is owned by a spirit. Everyone was conceived in sin (Psalm 51:5), and until they become born again, they remain properties of the devil.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Nobody is totally independent; every single person is owned by one spirit or the other. The question now is, who owns you? You can tell who owns a property by the way the property is being used; a property will reflect the character and personality of its owner. That is why Matthew 7:18-20 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>If you are owned by Christ, people will see the character of Christ, which is also known as the fruit of the Spirit, in you. Does your character reflect Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness and Temperance? (Galatians 5:22-23). If these do not define you, then it is likely that it is not God who owns you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since there are only two divides in the spirit realm – the kingdom of darkness and the kingdom of God, anyone that God does not own, is owned by the devil. This person will automatically engage in the works of the flesh as listed in Galatians 5:19-21. When you read that passage, you will see that many of the people who do these things do not even know that they are acting in accordance with their owner – the devil. For example, many people who envy think that it is just natural for humans to envy; they don't know that envy can only stay in their hearts because they are not owned by the One who is Love Himself. The Bible tells us in Romans 6:16:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>When Christ becomes your owner, you will no longer behave in line with the character of the devil. Surrender your life to Him today if you are yet to do so.</p>",

      "<p>One thing that everyone who is born again must learn is that the Christian walk is not a sprint but a marathon. I have been born again since 1973, and I am still on the journey until now. We were told back then, “Jesus is coming soon.” 'Soon' has run into more than 51 years now, and we are still awaiting His arrival. This tells you that without perseverance, you cannot win in the Christian race. It is good that you resisted temptation yesterday and did not fall, but that is not enough to ensure that you will remain standing until the end. You must also resist the temptation that is coming tomorrow. If a believer relaxes because of the things he or she has overcome in the past, it is likely that the fellow will be brought down by future temptations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It is in perseverance that many Christians fail. The devil knows that if he brings temptation to you once, you might not fall. However, he knows that if he keeps bringing the temptation over and over again in different forms and intensities, one day, when you are relaxed spiritually, you will likely fall. This is why having oil for today is good, but you must always have extra oil for tomorrow. The ten virgins in Matthew 25:1-13 were all virgins, meaning that they were all pure. They all had oil which signifies the Holy Spirit, but while they were waiting for the arrival of the Groom, they all slept because the Groom tarried. However, only the ones with extra oil were able to meet with the Groom. Proverbs 24:10 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>You must be prepared for the day of adversity. Believe me, without extra strength, you will not be able to persevere until the end. Therefore, read your Bible beyond what you need for today, pray longer hours than you need for today, and serve God more fervently than is necessary for today. Doing these will build in you the strength that you need to persevere. Many people have yielded to fraud in their offices because the oil finished, and they didn't have extra to keep them on fire. Some yielded to fornication and adultery because their strength failed. Don't make this mistake; get extra oil always.</p>",

      "<p>These days, many Christians look for ways to water down certain doctrines and prove that they are useless. When the doctrine of their Bible-believing church dictates that they should not dress in a certain way, for example, they go about looking for Hebrew and Greek interpretations of Scriptures to say that the doctrine is useless – this is not right. Doctrines are a major part of your Christian walk. Although they can sometimes appear to be tough to live by, they are codes of conduct that will keep you consecrated. A doctrine may not seem interesting when you are living by it, but if you keep doing so, over time, you will realise that it has helped you to stay strong in the faith.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God is always solidly behind doctrines. In fact, 2 Timothy 3:16 says that one of the reasons God gave us Scriptures is so that we can get doctrines from them:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>You must note, however, that doctrines are gotten from the Scriptures by the representative of God in the leadership of a denomination. The head of another denomination may not develop a doctrine from that same Scripture, but as long as the fellow whom you call your Father in the Lord develops a doctrine from a Scripture, you have to live by it. The early Church was strong with very fervent Christians because they continued steadfastly in the doctrines of their leaders, the Apostles, as we see in Acts 2:42:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</strong></i>&nbsp;<br>Note that you are not to choose which doctrine to follow based on convenience but based on your conviction that the one who brought the doctrine developed it from the Scriptures. You should also be convinced that the person is the spiritual leader that God wants you to submit to.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Doctrines raised from the Scriptures will set you apart from the world. They are a great catalyst for your spiritual growth and well-being.</p>",

      "<p>Many Christians take people's love and loyalty for Mgranted. When a brother or sister in Christ loves you, be careful not to disappoint them because if you do, and the fellow is offended, they may never regain the love they had for you. If someone is willing to make sacrifices for you, take that as a challenge for you to also make sacrifices for them. When they are loyal to you, you must also be loyal to them. The closer someone is to you, the more careful you must be not to offend them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many ministers of God feel that because they are the head of a ministry, they can do whatever they like without caring about the people that love them. For some, the moment they become popular, they begin to take those who started out with them for granted. Many sworn enemies today are people who were close friends yesterday. There is an English proverb that says, “Make new friends and keep the old; one is silver, the other is gold.” Old friends are gold; they knew and loved you when you were nothing. As years pass by, your new friends will also start turning to gold. You can keep making new friends but keep the old ones.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One thing that has helped us in RCCG is that everyone who laboured with us when we were still very small is honoured and appreciated. This way, the younger ones see that if they work hard, they will not be neglected.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The worst enemy anyone can have is the enemy within his or her household. An enemy that goes in and out with someone is very dangerous. Believers must be careful not to offend their brothers and turn them into enemies; they are likely to suffer greatly for it. When you notice that there is something that may offend your brother, call him aside and discuss it with him. Matthew 5:23-24 says that when you go to God with an offering, and you remember that a brother has something against you, you are to leave your offering there and seek to reconcile with that brother before you come back to give the offering. Note that the Bible does not say, “If you have something against the brother,” but, “If the brother has something against you.” Don't put a stumbling block between yourself and God. The Bible says in Romans 12:18, <i><strong>“If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>As much as it may be in your power, live in peace with everyone around you.</p>",

Therefore, when people live their lives just to give themselves pleasure, they are malfunctioning.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Having lots of money, driving good cars and owning houses does not mean that someone has fulfilled his or her destiny because all those things are for the fellow's pleasure. Destiny is not measured by how much money you have or how powerful you become; it is measured by the degree to which you are doing the will of God for your life. For example, someone might have seen Joseph as the Prime Minister of Egypt and said, “This guy has made it! He is fulfilling destiny because of the exalted position that he has attained,” but if Joseph did not save his family from the famine as God had created him to do (Genesis 45:1-11), he would have been a failure.

      "<p>A pastor once took a lady to a hotel room. Before they went in, they looked around to be sure that nobody could see them. On getting inside, the lady was uneasy and said to the pastor before taking to her heels, “Before we came in, we looked left and right to ensure that nobody saw us, but we did not look up…God can see us.” Believe me, there is no place that God's eyes do not get to. No matter how well some people think they can hide their sins, they cannot hide even the smallest of them from God. If no one can hide sins from God, it means no one can avoid the consequences of sins. Rather than trying to hide whatever sins you might have committed, why not change your ways?&nbsp;</p><p><br>The reason many people hide their sins is that they want to appear to all as being righteous. The question is, are they being righteous for people or for God? Is it people that will judge them on the last day or God Himself? They are like students that pretend to be studious by putting their books in front of them every time their parents are around but who never read. When examinations come, they will fail and be termed a failure even by the same parents they pretended to. When rapture happens, the same people they pretended to will see who they really are and then their secret will be out. Rather than pretend to people who are not important to your eternal destiny, it is better to get the real salvation so that the One who will judge you can see that you are truly born again.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are a true child of God and you're hiding your sins and pretending to people, I'm sure the Holy Spirit is telling you to stop the pretence and stop committing those sins. Don't ignore the voice of the Holy Spirit; listen and obey. God wants to have mercy on you now, and He will give you the grace to live a truly holy life, but you have to repent genuinely from your heart.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, if you are still harbouring any form of sin in your life, make the decision now to repent and forsake them. You can say this short prayer: “Lord Jesus, I am sorry for indulging in sin, I am ready to live a truly holy life. Please help me Lord, and let me never backslide again, in Jesus' name I pray.”</p>",

      "<p>Today, divorce rates are as high as 50% in some countries, and some people believe that they are better off not being married. This brings up the question, is marriage a blessing or a curse?&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some people argue that marriage is a curse because if Eve was not created, and marriage was not instituted in the first place, there would be no sin in the world. Adam also seemed to believe this theory because he blamed God for giving him Eve when he was asked why he ate the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:12). However, we must remember that Adam was alone, and God created Eve for his good. Everything was going well until sin came in. So, Eve was not the problem, the problem was sin.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Marriage can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on what either of the couple allows into their union. If marriage is done in line with God's word, it will be a blessing. However, if either of the couple goes outside the will of God and lets sin in, there will be trouble. Today makes it 57 years since I have been married, and I can tell you without a doubt that my marriage became a blessing when my wife and I gave our lives to Christ and started living according to His will. Before then, we would have disagreements that would last for weeks, but these stopped when we surrendered to Christ.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I recall the story of a couple who fought every single night. One day, someone invited them to a RCCG parish in their city, and when an altar call was made, they gave their lives to Christ. Over the next three weeks, their neighbours didn't hear them fighting. Curious, the neighbours asked the couple why they had not been fighting. They replied that they had brought Christ into their marriage, and He was the reason they stopped fighting. If your marriage is to be a blessing, you and your spouse must truly be born again, living according to God's word. You and your spouse should study the Bible, pray, and evangelise together. You should both be on fire for God. When you do these regularly, you will discover how beautiful marriage is. I am enjoying my marriage, and I pray that you will enjoy yours too, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>There are all kinds of 'prophets' these days. While&nbsp;there are genuine ones, many are false and give false prophesies that are sponsored by the devil. When a negative prophecy is from a prophet who genuinely hears from God, the fellow involved can cry to God like Hezekiah did in 2 Kings 20:1-11, and God can decide to change it. Tomorrow, I will discuss more about what you can do concerning negative prophecies but the discussion today will be centred on false prophecies.&nbsp;</p><p><br>We don’t have many accounts of false prophets in the Bible because God said in Ezekiel 13:9 that they will not be in the assembly of Israel or written about in the books of Israel. These days, false prophets try to plant fear in people with their prophecies. If these people allow fear to take root in their hearts, they have given those prophecies the power and permission they need to be accomplished. This is because what a person fears is likely to come upon him or her (Job 3:25-26). As a Christian, when such prophecies come your way, don't allow fear into your heart; God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Rather than being afraid, meditate on the word of God that negates the false prophecy and pray to God about it. Many false prophets have told me, “Thus saith the Lord.” However, God would always tell me, “Don't mind that fellow; that message is not from Me.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>Not long after the great Archbishop Benson Idahosa went to be with the Lord, some investors opened a bank and invited me to pray before they commenced operations. After praying, they asked me to open an account with them so that I will be their first customer. I told them that I didn't have money to open the account, so they opened it for me with N50,000 of their money. Shortly after that, some newspapers reported that I had started a bank with N50,000,000; the news was everywhere. We had a meeting of Pentecostal pastors in Nigeria just after that, and one 'prophet', misled by the newspaper reports, prophesied that I would soon be called home just like the archbishop. Others at the meeting urged me to react, but I stayed quiet because I know what the word of God says about my life. The man who made that prophecy is no more today, and I am still here by God's grace.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I talked about rejecting negative&nbsp;prophecies from false prophets. However, sometimes, a real prophet can prophesy something that you are not comfortable with. God sometimes tells us things just for our information; at other times, it is so that we can do something about them. How then do you reverse negative prophecies if you receive them?&nbsp;</p><p><br>Like Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20:1-11, the first thing you can do is to cry to God to reverse the prophecy. If He listens, He will send the same prophet back to you with a new prophecy. Secondly, you can get a prophet with a higher anointing to cancel the negative prophecy. This is what the people of Jericho did in today's Bible reading. Joshua had placed a curse on the land, but Elisha was able to cancel the decree that Joshua made because he had a double portion of the anointing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, a man told me that he met a prophet when he was 44 years old who told him all that would happen to him for the next 40 years and that he would die at 84. He said that everything the prophet told him had come to pass, and it was now two weeks to his 84th birthday. I asked if he wanted to serve God, and he said, “Yes,” so I told him that he will live. He insisted that everything the prophet told him had come to pass, but as a higher prophet, I replied that as long as he was willing to serve God, he would live until he was ready to die. A few weeks before his 100th birthday, he sent for me and said that he was ready to go; he died a few days before turning 100.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sometimes, negative prophecies can come to you directly from God, either in a dream, trance, or even in an audible voice. In such instances, you can meet a prophet who is closer to God than you and ask him to help you plead with God to change it. Years ago, a wealthy man, who had just given his life to Christ and had been of tremendous help to me in fulfilling God's work, had a dream where God told him to put his house in order because it was time for him to be called home. He came to me, and I said, “No!” I told him, “Don't worry, I will discuss it with my Daddy.” I told God, “Lord, I still need this man here, please don't take him yet.” God answered me, and the man lived.</p>",

      "<p>Sometimes, God gives prophecies that sound impossible to the human mind and this makes some people doubt and miss out on them. When a prophecy seems too good to be true or difficult to believe, just keep quiet. Don't say anything against the prophecy because if you do, you may never see it fulfilled. In today's Bible reading, the minister voiced his unbelief in Elisha's prophecy. The prophecy came to pass, but because of what he said, he did not live to experience it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What we say and/or do after receiving a prophecy matters. God told Abraham in Genesis 17:4 and Genesis 26:3-4 that he would be a father of nations and that his children would be as many as the stars in the sky. At that time, he and his wife were already old and did not have any children. Even though Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6), the prophecy was not fulfilled immediately. When it appeared as if the prophecy was not going to come to pass, Sarah got Abraham to have a child with Hagar, her handmaiden. Despite this, God told him in Genesis 17:1 to walk before Him and be perfect and repeated the prophecy. This time, Abraham doubted in his heart (Genesis 17:17), but he did not speak out, nor did he try another alternative outside God's will. God instructed him to circumcise all the males in his house as a sign of His covenant with him, and Abraham obeyed. Although he doubted God in his heart, his words and actions did not express it. Later, in Genesis 18, God appeared to him, and nine months after, Isaac was born. If your mouth and actions don't negate God's promises for you, no matter how unbelievable those promises sound, you will see them come to pass.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When God tells me something unbelievable, I immediately begin to repeat it to those He permits me to share it with. I don't give room for my human mind to process it and express doubts. I confess the prophecy repeatedly so that it becomes real to me. When God told me that He would build me a city, I could not even afford to build a small house, but I announced it to everyone who cared to hear. Today, He has fulfilled that prophecy. When He showed me trailers bringing in cows to feed the crowds that will be attending our programmes, I announced it to people, even though we did not have money to buy half a dozen cows. Today, that prophecy has been fulfilled as well.</p>",

When there is an opportunity to serve God through a prophet that you are sure is sent by Him, no matter how small the service may be, don’t let the opportunity pass you by. When you serve or give to a prophet, because of God's anointing on his or her life, you will receive a blessing from God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I went to a foreign country for a programme, and throughout my stay, a very rich man drove me around. When he dropped me off at the airport, I wanted to show my appreciation, but since he was richer than me, I put some money in an envelope and said, “Please give it to your children on my behalf.” He collected the money and said, “Amen” several times. I became embarrassed, and I turned to the other pastor who came with us. The pastor said, “He has been waiting on God for the fruit of the womb.” On hearing that, I said, “Glory be to God, I don't have money, but I am connected to the Most High God.” The following year, when I arrived in that country for another edition of the same programme, the man came to drive me again. This time, he had a gift with him and said that it was from his son. You might have prayed for certain things and not received them yet, but offering your service to God through a prophet could bring them to you immediately.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you check through the Scriptures, you will see that those who served prophets genuinely got great rewards for their service. Samuel became a kingmaker and king\u0002remover because he served Eli. Elisha got a double portion of the anointing because he served Elijah diligently. The Shunammite woman got a child even when she had lost hope because she served Elisha. Whenever you get a chance to serve God through one of His ministers, make the most of the opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Ministers of God, however, should not take anyone’s willingness to serve God through them for granted. God shows appreciation to those that serve Him, and His ministers ought to do the same. However, if you are serving God through one of His ministers and it seems like you are not being appreciated, as long as you are sure that he or she is a genuine minister of God, you will surely receive the rewards of your service from God.</p>",

Those who choose to disobey God are the ones that are actually losing, not God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him, it was not because He wanted to eat the boy for breakfast; it was because He wanted Abraham's obedience to open the door to irreversible blessings for him and his seed. If Abraham had disobeyed, he would have missed out on such a great blessing. When Elisha told Naaman to go and wash in the river Jordan, it was not because he wanted to humiliate him, it was because he wanted him to be healed of leprosy. Naaman almost missed his healing because of his pride. If he had not gone to wash, Elisha would not have lost anything, but Naaman would have died a leper. When God gives you an instruction, no matter how difficult it seems, you stand to gain a lot more from obeying it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God gave man a special gift, and that is free will. This free will is one of the things that makes us more special than all His other creations. You can decide to obey or disobey Him if you want. However, to justify any blessing that He wants to give to you, He wants you to obey Him out of your free will. If you disobey His instruction, you are using your free will against Him, and that will disqualify you from receiving the blessings that are attached to the instruction. When God sent Elijah to the widow of Zarephath for food, he told the woman to give him her last meal. It was not Elijah who needed a miracle; God had already been feeding him supernaturally up until that time. God wanted to test the widow to see if she would use her free will for herself or Him. She passed the test, and in return, she had more than enough food to last her through the famine. Also, when her son died in 1 Kings 17:17-22, because she had obeyed God, Elijah was there to bring him back to life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, obeying God is always for your good.</p>",

Rather, people, based on their behaviour toward God and His instructions, choose for themselves if they will be unto honour or unto dishonour.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are many people who say that since God is merciful, and His mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22- 23), they can commit sin multiple times and ask Him for mercy multiple times. Therefore, they commit sin purposely, trusting that when they ask for mercy, God will have mercy. Some even say things like, “God, forgive me for what I am about to say.” They know it is a sin, but they ask for forgiveness and go ahead to say it. People like this are trying to make a fool out of the Most High God and will become vessels unto dishonour if they do not repent. The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Even if a Christian gives a big sacrifice or worships God deeply, if his or her heart is still in a sinful state, the wages of sin remain death.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In today's Bible reading, God told Saul to kill all the Amalekites, but he decided to play on God's intelligence by saying that it was the people who brought the king of Amalek and the choice animals back with them to Israel.

      "<p>There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that&nbsp;is committed to God that does not turn out well. This is why you must commit things into God's hands and let Him take the lead in everything that you do. Ask Him for counsel before you make any move, and everything will go well.&nbsp;</p><p><br>My Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, exemplified committing things into God's hands. He placed the church in God's hands right from its outset. He did not just commit the church into God's hands in prayers, he also did so in actions. He did exactly everything that God asked Him to do as regards the church, and in turn, God fulfilled His promises concerning the church. Many people think that The Redeemed Christian Church of God is what it is today because of me; that is not true. God already decided the destiny of the church long before I became born again. If I had refused to obey Him, He would have gotten someone else to become the General Overseer. Whatever is committed into God's hands can never go wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you really want to be successful, place all your plans in the hands of God. Proverbs 3:5 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Don't depend on your degrees, skills, connections, or money; depend on God alone. Trust Him with all your heart, do everything according to His word, obey all His instructions, and you will see Him do great things for you. Make it clear to God that He is the owner of your career, business, ministry, and every other aspect of your life, and He will make sure that you have all-round success.&nbsp;</p><p><br>You must note, however, that when you commit something to God, you are agreeing to Him becoming your senior partner. This means that when He gives you instructions, you must obey. Some of these instructions may not make sense to you, and some may be very difficult for you to do, but if you don't take the control back from Him, and if you submit to His leadership, you will enjoy greater success than you could ever have had all by yourself.</p>",

It is not bad to want to achieve something great or pursue a good cause, but if you try to outrun God, you may never achieve that goal, and worse still, you may pay for it with something very precious to you. God knows your desires; in fact, it is likely that He is the one who put them there. He knows the best times and the best ways for those desires to be accomplished, so, don't try to act smarter than the One who made your brain.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, I was duped by a man who promised to make me a commandant of a paramilitary group. This man had been sending messages to me through my secretary for a while, and so, one day, I gave him audience. He explained to me how a Boy-Scouts-like group had evolved into this new agency, and that he was sourcing for who would lead the group spiritually. Normally, I ask God before getting involved in anything at all, but this time, my love for the military in my younger days beclouded my best instincts, and l agreed to be their head. He told me that they needed some funding, which I gave as the prospective head. However, I later found out that the man was a fake. My desire to be part of a paramilitary group made me run ahead of God, but God had already purposed for Redemption City to have its own corps of chaplains as well as a local Police post. He knew the desire of my heart, and He had planned for it to be fulfilled in His own time. I thought that I could bring my desire to fulfilment at my own time, but I was wrong. What I lost in that experience was money, but for someone else, it might have been their life or a loved one.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Bible makes it clear that God delights in our well-being and prosperity (Psalm 35:27, 3 John 1:2). Therefore, it is not wrong to desire wealth. He will definitely make you prosper, but in His own time. Beloved, follow God's timing; don't try to outrun Him.</p>",

This was a man who witnessed how his highly-exalted king, King Saul, suddenly started acting like a mad man on several occasions and needed music from a harp to calm him down (1 Samuel 16:23). This was a man who used an ordinary stone to bring down a giant that had terrorised his country for 40 days and nights (1 Samuel 17). As humans, we have the tendency to believe that we are strong and that we are in control, whereas, God is the One that upholds us (Isaiah 41:8-10).&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Daniel 4:30, Nebuchadnezzar was boasting of his really great achievements, but within that same hour, he was on all fours, eating grass with the beasts of the field (Daniel 4:31-33). He was indeed a great king, but God humbled him in an instant. No matter how great and powerful a fellow is, God can humble him or her in the twinkling of an eye. King Herod thought that he was powerful and could capture and kill whoever he wanted to (Mark 6:16-17), but right in front of his people, he was eaten up by ordinary maggots (Acts 12:23). When God wants to show that He is in control, He can use ants to bring down an elephant. This is why you will always see me being humble, kneeling to worship God in public, and surrendering my all to Him. I know what I am doing because I know that without Him, I am nothing. I know that no matter how powerful people think I am, God can break me like a toothpick if I offend Him.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, always live conscious of your frailty in God's hands; don't ever think you are in control. Keep it at the back of your mind at all times that God is in control. The producers of a popular television show in Nigeria would always say that we are nothing but pencils in the hand of the Creator. If you think you are better than everyone else, know that you are just a pencil in God's hands, and He can do with you as He pleases. Like David, ask God to always remind you of how frail you are in His hands.</p>",

Whenever a prophecy is given based on feelings, that prophecy is false, and the Bible describes people who do this as fools (Ezekiel 13:3). A true prophecy is an echo of what God has said.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When I was younger in ministry, I recall prophesying that a particular airline will never suffer loss because I was excited over their services to the church. I prophesied based on my feelings without hearing what God had to say. Not long after, the airline suffered a plane crash. I should have just prayed for them and blessed them for their benevolence, rather than giving a prophecy in my excitement. I learnt my lesson from that – if God has not spoken, I do not prophesy.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, don't be too much in a hurry to say 'God said' when God didn't say anything. Don't allow pride to push you to prophesy; prophesy only according to the will of God. Push pride aside so that you can hear God clearly. Long before the Nigerian elections in 2023, people were agitated as to who will become the next president. They put pressure on me to tell them what the outcome of the elections will be. Even with all that pressure, I made sure not to say anything I had not heard God say because I knew that it would be a lie. I told them a few weeks before the election, “God has still not spoken. Until God speaks, I won't say anything.” You must become comfortable with keeping quiet when God is quiet. If you are truly His mouthpiece, when His mouth is shut, yours will be also.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Prophecy must also be in line with the word of God. If a prophecy does not echo the word of God in the Scriptures, it is false. A man came to me and said, “I heard that you are a prophet, and anything you say comes to pass. Can you tell me my future?” I responded, “That is easy. Are you born again?” He said, “No”. “Then, your future will be terrible,” I responded. He asked, “How do you know? You've not even asked for my name.” I told him, “Isaiah 3:11 says, 'Woe unto the wicked.'” Anyone who has not accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour is condemned already (John 3:17-18).&nbsp;</p><p><br>A true prophecy comes from God and always aligns with His word in the Scriptures.</p>",

A secondary school student is usually waiting earnestly for when he or she will get into the university, the university student is waiting to graduate, the graduate is waiting to get a job, the single person is waiting to get married, the married person is waiting to have children, and parents are waiting for the different stages of their children's life. The waiting goes on for different things at different times.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Waiting is inevitable for everyone, however, what you do while waiting is more important than what you are waiting for itself. When people lose their patience with God and decide to do things outside His will to stop their waiting season, they often regret it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In 1 Samuel 13:8-14, Saul got tired of waiting for Samuel's arrival to perform a sacrifice, so he decided to perform the sacrifice himself, which was against the will of God. That action resulted in him losing his throne. In Genesis 16:1-3, Sarah got tired of waiting on God for a child, so she gave Hagar to Abraham as a wife. She regretted it after Hagar conceived (Genesis 16:4), and today, that action has resulted in great persecution for her descendants. Finding alternatives to God in order to shorten a waiting season always ends in regrets. My wife and I were praying for a woman to conceive. At some point, she got tired of waiting on God and went to see a herbalist. She got pregnant quite alright, but the pregnancy that should last for only nine months remained for years. The last time I heard about her, she still hadn't given birth to the baby. Every alternative to God gives permission to the devil to oppress you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The reason we have many internet fraudsters today is that many young people don't want to go through the correct process of making money. What they don't know is that although they could get a lot of money quickly, what they will have to give in exchange for that money is their very soul. Matthew 16:26 says that this is foolish because there is only loss in a fellow gaining the whole world and losing his or her soul in the process.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't be foolish, wait on God, and He will surely come through for you.</p>",

      "<p>Marriage is a beautiful gift from God; it is designed to bring joy and fulfilment to both partners. Like every other gift from God, it comes with a manual – the word of God. In today's Bible reading, there is a detailed description of how a husband and wife should relate with each other. Husbands are to love their wives as Christ loves the church, while wives are to submit to their husbands.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many women don't understand what submission really means. They say they are submissive, whereas they are only cooperative. Cooperation is agreeing with your husband because you want the same things. Submission, however, is complying with his wish even when you don't agree. Many women find it difficult to submit to their husbands because the society talks about gender equality. However, this is not what the Bible says about marriage.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Submission does not mean slavery or servitude, rather, it is a voluntary act of respect and obedience from a wife to her husband as the head of the home. When you obey your boss in the office, it is not because you are a slave, it is because there is a hierarchy that must be followed for things to go smoothly in the office. An English proverb says that two captains cannot sail a ship. As a wife, your husband is the captain of your marriage-ship; submitting to him is a key ingredient in ensuring that you have a blissful marriage.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, I used to preach regularly at a university, and a woman would usually come to me complaining about her husband's stubbornness and asking me to pray the stubbornness away. After a while, I decided I wasn't going to pray anymore. I told her, “When you get home, place his food on the dining table, call him your head, and ask him to come and eat. When he sits at the table, give him a bowl of water, kneel and let him wash his hands in it.” She said, “No way! He is a professor just like I am. We are the same.” I replied that if she wanted my help, she should take my advice. She decided to do it, and at first, her husband wondered if she had poisoned the food. She told him that her pastor taught her what she was doing, and suddenly, the stubborn husband became very soft. He followed her to the next service and became born again. Their marriage blossomed thereafter.</p>",

This analogy alone is enough to tell us straightaway that love is not an emotion or feeling, but a decision to consistently act in the best interest of your spouse. In other words, the best interest of your spouse should become a priority to you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Luke 22:42, Jesus did not feel like dying for the church. He tried to convince God to let the impending suffering and death pass over Him. He prayed so hard that His sweat was like blood, but what had to be done, had to be done. He went to the cross, suffered shame, pain, and death for the ones He loved. That is what husbands are to do for their wives; love them as Christ loves the church and gave Himself for her. Husband, can you do this for your wife?&nbsp;<br>When I see Christian husbands buying new clothes and shoes for themselves while their wives wear old, worn out clothes, I wonder if they even read their Bibles at all. Worse still are the men who beat their wives. As a husband, if you love your wife, you will take good care of her and put her interests above yours. Money will be too small to sacrifice to make her happy. In Nigeria, men of the Igbo tribe are renowned for truly caring for their wives. In Igbo land, any man that beats his wife or does not take care of her is called an Efulefu. An Efulefu is someone who is way below useless, empty, and who has nothing good to offer. This is a generally held belief among people who are not all believers, how much more Christians who have been directed by God to take care of their wives and families (1 Timothy 5:8).&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. </strong></i>Ephesians 5:28&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Scripture above instructs husbands to love their wives as they love their own bodies. Just as they eat good food, put on good clothes, and do not allow any harm to come to their bodies, they are to treat their wives the same way. As a husband, you should use the best of your resources, words, and actions to show your wife that you love her. When you do this, you are a good husband indeed, and one advantage that a good husband has, according to today's memory verse, is that God hears his prayers.</p>",

However, if she is earning below that, when there is a need for her to help, she may be unable to do so significantly, even though she is willing to help. As a pastor, if you can pray for six hours at a stretch, train your wife to be able to pray for at least four hours. This way, the day you need prayers, she can stand in the gap for you at a reasonable level. If you cannot send your wife to preach on your behalf at a meeting that you are unable to attend, you have not been training her, and she has not developed what it takes to be your helpmeet (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Your helpmeet is supposed to be there to lift you up when you are down. However, the strength of your helpmeet will determine how well they can lift you in your down seasons. As a husband, if something terrible happens and you fall, you will fall to the level of your wife. She can only catch you at the level at which she is standing financially, spiritually or otherwise. Therefore, if you don't lift her to your level or at least close to your level, your fall will be great in such seasons because you will only be able to depend on her resources to stay afloat until you start rising again. As a husband, you should endeavour to empower your wife to become a helpmeet to you indeed.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will conclude my teaching on what it means to be a true helpmeet. There are wives who parade themselves as helpmeets, but they are not. As a wife, if you hide money, saying, “My money is my money, and my husband's money is our money,” you are not a helpmeet. To help someone, you must be willing to sacrifice your resources. You cannot claim to be helping when you do not meet needs that you can easily afford to. Yes, it is a husband's responsibility to take care of the home, but whenever you can afford it, it will be very helpful to say, “Don't worry about this, I have taken care of it.” Helping someone entails taking burdens off the person and not watching him or her carry them alone.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As a helpmeet, you must be fully involved in what your husband does; be there to help him in areas he needs help, especially when he asks for it. You cannot be a helpmeet if you are not submissive. If you are to help someone with something, they will give you instructions on how to help them. When they give you instructions, your answer should be, “Yes, darling.” If you say “No”, you are clearly not willing to help. If you want to suggest a better idea, your answer should be, “How about we do it this way?” as opposed to an outright “No.” If you are truly interested in your husband's success, you will do all you can to help him.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When I moved my family to Redemption City, it was not convenient for my wife. We moved from a city to the middle of a forest, and the house we moved into had no windows – this is where the Open Heavens International Centre is today. Not only did my wife move into such inconvenience, but she also began rigorous rural evangelism in the surrounding areas. She gathered a small team to help her and would travel to many villages several kilometres away, preaching the gospel. Some people didn't want to hear about Christ, while some said that they were already part of bigger church denominations. However, she persisted and was able to establish most of the parishes we have around the city today, even all the way to Ibafo, which is about 20 kilometres away. She is a perfect example of a helpmeet, one that gets involved and does everything in her power to see her husband succeed.</p>",

The question now is, how come some Christians don't use this blank cheque? The answer is in Psalm 10:4:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Christians that do not pray are proud; it means that they do not have God in all their thoughts because they think they are smart enough to solve all their problems. 1 Corinthians 1:25 says that no matter how wise you are, the things of God that may appear foolish far exceed human wisdom, and the things that seem weak far exceed human strength. It is foolishness not to pray.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One day, when I was a child, I was playing football in front of our house. At a point, I kicked the ball to the top of the roof, and it got stuck there. I was little, so I couldn't see the ball. I tried using a stick to get the ball down from the roof, but I was not able to. My dad was sitting close by, but I didn't call him for help. At last, when I was tired, I asked for his help, and he said, “You saw me here all this while, but you didn't think to ask for my help.” He stood up and, with one sweep of his hand, brought the ball down. I thought I could bring the ball down by myself, and I kept stressing myself to do so even though I could have just asked my dad for help and gotten the ball easily. Many people stress themselves unnecessarily, running from pillar to post in search of solutions to problems that can easily be solved on their knees in prayers to God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God gave you a blank cheque in Jeremiah 33:3:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>I have been using my blank cheque at every opportunity, and God has been answering and showing me great and mighty things that I did not know.

      "<p>The devil is always looking for signs that mark out people of great destinies. You may have noticed long ago that you are not in this world to be ordinary, and that there is a great destiny that God has ordained for you. The devil may also sense this, and even though he is unable to fully understand it, he will begin to send destiny destroyers to the fellow to ensure that he or she does not fulfil that glorious destiny. One major destiny destroyer the devil tries to use is illicit sex.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Genesis 37:5-9, the devil heard Joseph talk about his destiny and marked him for destruction. He tried to get his brothers to kill him, but they ended up selling him into slavery. The devil thought that Joseph would not fulfil his dreams in slavery, but when he saw how he prospered in Potiphar's house even as a slave, he knew that the only way he could stop him was to tempt him with illicit sex, so he sent Potiphar's wife to seduce him (Genesis 39:11-12). Thankfully, Joseph did not fall for the temptation because that would have been the end of his big dreams and destiny. Every time you are tempted to engage in illicit sex, that is the devil trying to destroy your destiny. Your response will determine if you will still fulfil destiny or not.&nbsp;</p><p><br>No matter how great a person's destiny is, giving room to fornication or adultery will destroy such a fellow because the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 that our bodies are God's temple, and if a fellow defiles God's temple, he or she will be destroyed. Samson was really great and powerful, so much so that he could single-handedly defeat an entire army. However, as powerful as he was, he met his defeat in the laps of a woman that he wasn't married to. Before long, he was grinding corn for his enemies (Judges 16:21).&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you find out that you are having illicit sexual desires towards someone of the opposite sex, you should run to God for mercy, go on a fast, and pray for those desires to die. This way, you will strengthen yourself enough to avoid falling into the temptation and those illicit sexual desires will die eventually.&nbsp;<br>Beloved, guard yourself against the devil's temptations to engage in sexual immorality. Don't allow him to make you destroy your destiny with your own hands. Resist him, and he will flee from you (James 4:7).</p>",

Another means through which the devil destroys destinies is greed. 1 Timothy 6:10 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Once the devil can get someone to love money, other evils will begin to spring forth. Money should not have dominion over you; don't make decisions that you know will offend God solely because of money. Anything that is against the will of God, even if it has benefits worth billions of dollars attached to it, must become a taboo to you. Many people have stolen money to buy a car, and then that car became their coffin.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Gehazi had a great destiny ahead of him; he could have inherited a double portion of the double-portion anointing that Elisha had, and that would have given him tremendous power. However, greed denied him of a great destiny. No matter how much money a Christian is tempted to steal, God's plan for his or her life is much bigger than it. I have seen great destinies destroyed because the people involved were too much in a hurry to become rich, and so, they took what they ought not to take. Proverbs 28:20 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Don't be too much in a hurry to be rich. If someone is too much in a hurry for riches, he or she will not be innocent, and that lack of innocence is what the devil will use to destroy such a fellow. Be faithful, and you will abound in blessings. Don't envy the people who are doing all manner of evil things to get money now; they are rams awaiting slaughter. Proverbs 15:27 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Those who are greedy of gain are calling trouble on themselves and their families; it is only a matter of time before they begin to burn from the troubles that they bring on themselves.

When we first started building Redemption City, I knew some bricklayers who would have been very wealthy by now if only they had not been lazy. God had set them up in a place where they could have had great success, but their laziness robbed them of that opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, don't be lazy. When I meet some pastors who started about the same time as me, they will usually say, “God has been good to you.” Truly, God has been really gracious to me, but then, nobody can accuse me of laziness. God can supply you with the grace you need to fulfil your destiny, but if you are lazy, the grace He provided will go to waste because you will not use it. Many have prayed for open doors, but when the door was opened before them, they did not walk into it because of their laziness.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In today's Bible reading, we are told to learn from the ants as they provide their meat and gather their harvest at the right time. These days, some people make excuses to hide their laziness using different terms like exhaustion, procrastination, and so on. When a fellow constantly disregards the things that he or she ought to do when they ought to be done, it is simply laziness. For instance, if someone is to go out at 8am, but decides to stay in bed and refuses to have a bath nor get his or her clothes ironed by 7:30am, that is laziness.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you read Proverbs 24:30-34, you will see the major danger in laziness. Laziness does not destroy destinies suddenly, it does it little by little. If you are lazy, you will look back at your life after a while, and you will realise that you are far from the things that you set out to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, please banish any form of laziness in your life. The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 9:11 that time and chance happen to everyone. If you are lazy, when your time and chance come, you will likely be in bed sleeping. Don't allow a little sleep to destroy your destiny. Good sleep is very important for your health and general well-being, however, do not oversleep or sleep when you ought to be working.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Get up and work!

Gluttons cannot control their appetites, and such people do not usually go far in life. They simply want to eat every time; food has become their preoccupation – their god.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Controlling your appetite is very important, and this is why the Bible says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. </strong></i>Proverbs 23:1-2&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Scripture above does not imply that believers should literally put a knife to their necks, rather, it is saying that if they cannot control their appetite, even if they sit at a table with great men, they will still bring about their own destruction. The Bible tells us that even though Daniel and his friends were chosen amongst those to eat a portion of the king's food, they controlled their appetites and chose not to defile themselves with the food. They chose to honour God by controlling their appetites, and God honoured them in return (Daniel 1:1-21).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Esau's destiny was destroyed with a bowl of porridge; just one bowl of food caused his name to be omitted from the list we usually talk about – the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ‘Jacob’ on the list would have been Esau, but he couldn’t control his appetite and lost his place on that great list (Genesis 25:29-34).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some adults eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, snack in-between meals, and eat again just before going to bed. How can you have the strength to wake up in the middle of the night for spiritual warfare when you are so loaded with food that you can hardly stand? There are many people who died untimely deaths and truncated their own destinies because of how much food they ate. They ate to the point of endangering their health, and then they passed on. Don't let this be your portion.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, you should eat only when necessary and eat only the quantity of food that you need to survive. When you eat too much, you will be weak, and you will have less strength to do the things that you need to do to achieve greatness. Those whose belly is their god – meaning they are controlled by it – will end up in destruction. Control your appetite!</p>",

While it is impossible to remain young forever, you can still have the strength and vigour of a youth no matter how old you become.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I told some friends sometime ago that since Joel 2:28 says that young men see visions, if you still have visions that you are pursuing, you are young. God will give you visions when you wait on Him in His presence (Habakkuk 2:1-2). Those who spend quality time with God are visionaries; they come out of His presence loaded with visions that they want to accomplish. Before I became born again, my biggest vision was to be the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa, but after I got saved and started spending time with God, I began to have bigger visions.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There is always a transfer from God to you when you spend quality time with Him. In Exodus 34:30-35, when Moses returned after he had been with God, the Israelites could not look at his face because God's glory was all over him. Moses spent quality time with God; he once went to a mountain and stayed there with God for 40 days (Exodus 24:18). No wonder when he was 120 years old, his strength had not reduced, and his eyes were still very sharp (Deuteronomy 34:7). Abraham was over 80 years old when he went to war to rescue his nephew, Lot (Genesis 14:13-16). He could do so because he was a man of altars, always spending time with God. Spending quality time with God keeps you strong and youthful. With the little sleep that I often get because of my tight schedules, I should be looking older than my age, but by God’s grace, I am still strong enough at 82 to go on long walks, and my eyes are not dim. It is not because I am special; it is because I am always in contact with God's glory in His presence.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, you can retain the vitality of youth even until your old age by being addicted to His presence. However, you shouldn't live an unhealthy lifestyle and expect God to keep you young because you spend hours in His presence. Anyone who is irresponsible with his or her health will face the consequences.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Spend quality time with God; His glory will rub off on you, and your youth will be renewed as the eagle’s.</p>",

      "<p>There are five categories of prayers: very easy prayers,&nbsp;easy prayers, hard prayers, dangerous prayers, and 'impossible' prayers. For the next few days, I will be teaching on each of them to help you have a more robust prayer life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The first category of prayers is the very easy prayers. This is praise and worship. Praise and worship is very easy because you don't have to be a theologian to praise God; even little children can praise Him (Matthew 21:15-16).&nbsp;</p><p><br>David said that his soul would not forget all of God's benefits, and so he would bless the Lord (Psalm 103:2). As a songwriter said, if you count your blessings and name them one by one, it will be very easy to praise God. David said, <i><strong>“I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth.” </strong></i>(Psalm 34:1). You can praise God non-stop because praising Him is very easy when you count your blessings. It is very easy to do, yet it is extremely powerful. Unfortunately, many Christians don't praise God much.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When we were about to open the first parish of The Redeemed Christian Church of God in Abuja, I was in my hotel room, praying concerning the programme that would hold that evening and asking God to perform miracles, heal the sick, and save souls. While praying, God said, “Shut up, am I your houseboy? Have you thanked Me for all I've done for you in the past?” I said, “Oh Lord, thank You for all You have done in the past. Tonight, please heal the sick…” Again, He told me to shut up and that I should only praise Him and not ask for anything for the next three days. It was very difficult, but I did it anyway. By the end of the third day, He said, “Select elders who will be going around, teaching the doctrine of the church to strengthen its foundation because all you have seen thus far is addition; get ready for multiplication.” The result of praising Him then can be clearly seen today as RCCG has indeed multiplied greatly.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Do you engage in this very easy prayer of praise and worship? How often do you praise God? Look around you, there are multitudes of things you can praise God for; praise Him continually for them. I know there are some things that you wish He has done, but what about all He has done already? If you find it difficult to praise God for what He has done, how do you expect Him to do more?&nbsp;</p><p><br>Don't be an ingrate; go ahead and praise God with all your might.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I taught about praise and worship being in the category of very easy prayers and the fact that even little children can praise God. Today, I will discuss God's reaction to very easy prayers.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The first thing you must know about this category of prayers is that God is looking for people that pray this way. Students seek knowledge, politicians seek power, businessmen seek profit, but God seeks worshippers. He is constantly searching for people that will worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24). When He finds such people, He is so happy that He gives them blessings and miracles that they did not even ask for. Psalm 67:5-6 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>When we had just begun to hold the Holy Ghost Service at Redemption City, I was fasting and praying towards the programme one day when God said, “Don't pray, just praise Me.” I did that, and the way He responded amazed me. On the first night of the Holy Ghost Service, He healed 14,000 people. We were few then, so that was almost everyone in attendance! After the programme, I was in my prayer room, thanking Him because I had not seen such before. Then, He told me to praise Him more and that He would do more the next day. I did not understand what He was saying because almost everyone had been healed on the first day. What I did not know was that the people who had gotten their healing went to tell their friends, and more people came the following day. On that day, 16,000 people were healed! I became frightened. Imagine having a congregation of 15,000 people, and by the next day, it had grown to 30,000! Praising and worshipping God causes Him to do frightening miracles.&nbsp;</p><p><br>A few years ago, during a wedding ceremony in a parish of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, the groom suddenly fell and died while signing the marriage register. All the pastors gathered and prayed all the prayers they knew, yet the young man's corpse grew colder. Then, someone said that they should all stop praying and just praise God. Not long after they started doing that, the groom rose from the dead.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, the easiest route to getting God to pay attention to you is through praise and worship. Do it continuously.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my teaching on the various categories of prayer by looking at the second category: easy prayers. You pray easy prayers when you ask God for what He has already guaranteed in the Bible. For example, asking God for your daily bread is asking for something that He has already guaranteed (Matthew 6:9-11). The shepherd does not eat grass; it is meant for the sheep. So, when you ask God for food as His sheep, it is an easy prayer that He will answer easily (Psalm 23).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Psalm 35:27 says that God has pleasure in your prosperity. Therefore, asking for wealth is an easy prayer. Years ago, when I asked God for money to build a small house in Mushin, Lagos, He said, “Don't ask for a house, I have decided to give you a city.” So, when seven of us gathered in Ilorin to pray for a campground, one of us began to prophesy, “I have already provided the land, I will only show it to you.” The land was already provided because He guaranteed it in His word (Psalm 2:8).&nbsp;</p><p><br>One of my children said, 'Give me' is the prayer of a child. When your son comes to ask you for food, he is just saying, “I am ready for the next ration,” he is not bothered about the provision of the food. In the same vein, you should not be bothered about things that God has already promised you in the Scriptures. They are already provided for you, so all you need to do is ask, and you will get them at the right time. There is no need to worry about money, food, or all those things that make you comfortable; God has already provided them (Matthew 6:25-34).&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you worry about the things that God has guaranteed, it shows that you have little faith. Before you came to this world, He had prepared everything you need to survive. Just ask for them when you need them. As you ask, pay attention to whatever instructions He will give you on how to get them. In 1 Kings 17:4-6, He told Elijah to go to the brook and food was brought to him there. If Elijah did not obey, he would have died of hunger even though food was available for him. Your well-being is God's responsibility; stop worrying about it.</p>",

      "<p>Over the last three days, I have discussed very easy prayers and easy prayers. Today, I will talk about hard prayers.&nbsp;</p><p><br>You pray hard prayers when you ask God to change the natural order of things and negate the laid-down laws that govern the world. For example, when Joshua stopped the sun from setting, he prayed for something that was contrary to nature (Joshua 10:12-14). Also, in today's Bible text, King Hezekiah wanted the sun to go backwards as a sign that he would be healed. That was a hard prayer, but God did it still. If God answered these prayers by breaking the laws of nature just because someone asked Him to, then there is nothing that is too difficult to ask Him to do in your life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, a pregnant woman came to me, saying that she already had daughters, but that her in-laws had threatened to chase her out of her husband's house if she didn't deliver a son with her current pregnancy. I told her that according to science, a baby's gender is decided within 72 hours after it is conceived. She replied that I was not the one who will change the gender of the baby; all she wanted was for me to agree with her in prayers. I did so, and she gave birth to a boy. You may say that the baby was probably a boy all along, however, I shared this testimony while preaching one day, and a woman came to meet me after the service. She was eight months pregnant and had done a scan which revealed that the baby in her womb was a boy. However, she wanted a girl because she wanted to be able to share her dresses with her daughter. I told her, “You know very well that this baby is fully formed by now.” She replied that I was not the one who will perform the miracle; she just wanted me to agree with her in prayers. I did so, and she gave birth to a girl!&nbsp;</p><p><br>Nothing is too hard for God to do (Jeremiah 32:27). He made the laws of nature and can suspend them at any time. He can reverse the irreversible just because you ask Him to. During one of our programmes, a man wanted to see the miracles happening at the altar and whispered to God that he would like to be taller. He outgrew his trousers on the spot and everyone could see it! Indeed, nothing is too hard for God to do.</p>",

      "<p>In continuation of my teaching on the categories of prayer, I will focus on dangerous prayers today. Some prayers are dangerous because what will follow if God answers them will be dangerous. This is because to whom much is given, much is required (Luke 12:48).&nbsp;</p><p><br>The prayer for God to anoint you and give you spiritual gifts is a dangerous prayer. The greater your anointing, the more visible you will be to the enemy. When you read Judges 15, you will see how powerful Samson was. However, in Judges 16, you will see how dangerous that power was. This is why I spend quality time praying for my children who are evangelists. I thank God for their lives and the miracles happening through them, but I also know that the anointing makes them very visible to the enemy, and they need to be protected.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The enemy is always after anointed people. In 2 Kings 1:7- 15, the king sent a total of 153 soldiers to arrest Elijah. However, in 2 Kings 6:8-16, when the king wanted to arrest Elisha, who had a double-portion anointing, he sent the entire army. There is a level of wealth and influence that, if you ask God for and He gives it to you, will have dangerous results. This is why sometimes, God holds some things back from some people, because He knows that they cannot handle them. Like Elisha, if you ask for a level of the anointing and God gives it to you, your tongue will not remain the same. With it, you can bless, and you can also kill. In 2 Kings 2:19-24, Elisha spoke, and the curse that had been on Jericho for generations vanished. Also, he decreed a curse on 42 unruly children, and they all died immediately.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It is good to ask for great things, but when you do, remember Numbers 20:1-12. Moses had led the Israelites for 40 years, he made only one mistake, and God said that he wouldn't go into the Promised Land because of it. This is why it is important to always pray for your leaders, especially your spiritual leaders. The power that they possess can both heal and kill. In Acts 5:1-11, Ananias and Sapphira sold a land, brought less than the amount they received to Peter, and that deception cost them their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Power can bless, kill, heal, and make sick; be sure you can handle it before you ask for it. In 2 Kings 5:1-27, Naaman was cleansed by obeying an instruction from Elisha, and Gehazi became a leper by another word from the same mouth.</p>",

The Bible&nbsp;says that some things are impossible with men, but with God, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26, Luke 1:37). If you have any doubt about this at all, just take a look at Redemption City, and you will know that with God, all things are possible. There are buildings in Redemption City that were built in seven days and which have been standing for around 40 years. The first secondary school building in the city is a two-storey building that was built in 18 days. I don't use human engineering, I use divine engineering because, with my God, nothing is impossible.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The moment God hears, “It can't be done” from your mouth, it just may never be done. This is because Numbers 14:28 says, “…<i><strong>as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:”</strong></i> Despite a fellow's unbelief, God's purpose will always be done, only that He will raise up another generation that will get the work done. In Numbers 13-14, twelve spies were sent to Jericho; ten of them came back and said that they couldn't take the land, while only two said they could. God ensured that all the people who said that they couldn't take the land were wiped out in the wilderness, while only the two who said that it was possible entered the land. In 2 Kings 7:1-17, Elisha proclaimed a seemingly impossible economic breakthrough within 24 hours. Everyone in the room kept quiet except one man who said that even if God created windows in heaven, it would be impossible. The breakthrough happened, but that man did not partake in it. Never say that anything is impossible; the moment someone says that something cannot be done, as far as he or she is concerned, it just may never be done.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When Jesus said in John 14:14, <i><strong>“If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it,” </strong></i>He was not joking. Therefore, if I ask for something that seems impossible, He will give it to me because He did not put any limit on what I can ask for according to His will (1 John 5:14-15).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, don't express doubt when it comes to God. Don't try to understand what He can do and how He will do it. Just believe.</p>",

The fellow who said that did not put God in the equation. With God, nothing is impossible. He can restore the unrestorable. You might have lost an opportunity in the past and now you think that it is impossible to regain that opportunity. However, there is nothing impossible with God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Ezekiel 37:1-11, God restored life to dry bones. God can restore that opportunity that you think is long gone to you if you have faith. He specialises in doing the impossible.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When I was studying at the University of Lagos, I applied to the Federal Ministry of Education for a scholarship to pursue a Master's degree. Time passed, and I never got a response from the ministry. Somehow, I raised the money for my tuition, and life went on. When I was close to obtaining the Master's degree, I met someone I used to know back when I was a games master in a secondary school. He was a games master at another school, and we had met when both of our schools were involved in a competition. As we talked, I found out that he now worked at the Federal Ministry of Education. I told him, “You people are very tough at the ministry. I applied for a scholarship, and I wasn't even called for an interview.” He told me that he would look into it. I thought I would get a letter asking me to come for an interview, but to my surprise, the letter I got was to tell me that I had been awarded the scholarship. Since I had already paid my tuition, I bought a land and built my first house with the money I was awarded. God used a casual meeting to restore an opportunity that I thought was long gone, and it led to me building my first house.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What you may have lost could be more serious. If you have lost your first love for Christ, and the passion and love that you had for Him at the beginning seems to have died, God will restore your love for Him today, in Jesus' name. You can love Him far more than you ever did. All you have to do is cooperate with Him as He guides you on what to do for that love to be restored.</p>",

      "<p>Many people have sought to find out the real meaning and essence of life. I have discovered that the only thing that gives life meaning is a relationship with Jesus Christ. Without Christ, life has no meaning. Without Christ, a man is like a boat, rocked back and forth by the waves of this world. He may pursue a variety of personal objectives, amass wealth, achieve success in one field or the other, or gain pleasure in one thing or another, but soon he will discover that they are all momentary and unsatisfying without Christ. No matter how rich you become, Ecclesiastes 5:10 says that money doesn't satisfy. In Christ, you have everything you need for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3).&nbsp;</p><p><br>In Ephesians 2:1, Apostle Paul referred to those without Christ as being 'dead in trespasses and sins'. He said in verse 3 that they fulfil the desires of the flesh, and if anyone has lived long enough, he or she would have discovered that the desires of the flesh do not bring satisfaction. At the end of the day, what people need to gain the joy that they seek is to satisfy the burning desire to connect with their Maker, the Lord Jesus Christ. Until that is done, they will always feel empty. Cars, awards, titles, and all the money in this world can never fill that void in their hearts. Until they have a relationship with Christ, their lives will remain</p><p>&nbsp;meaningless. This is why when people become born again, all of a sudden, they feel this inner peace that cannot be explained. What follows after is joy. Life now suddenly has a meaning.&nbsp;<br>Beloved, make Christ your top priority. Don't trade Him for money or anything else because it will profit you nothing if you gain the whole world and lose your soul (Matthew 16:26). People who do not have Christ will not only live a life of depression and chaos on earth, but they will also suffer for eternity in hell. The worst thing about hell is not the unquenchable fire and undying worms that will torture its occupants (Mark 9:48); it is the eternal separation from God and the regret of choosing to continue in sin despite hearing several messages of God's salvation.

      "<p>Occasionally, I wonder, “Do I still love God like I&nbsp;used to? Was there a time when I loved Him more than I do now?” In the past, many of us were willing to do anything for Him; we were hungry to please Him at whatever cost and give to Him even when we had next to nothing. I remember the days when we used to have Bible Study Leaders Retreat, and we would take offerings. From the offerings, you would know that if the congregation had more, they would willingly give more. One brother gave his belt because he didn't have any money to give!&nbsp;</p><p><br>How is your love for God now? Is it greater or less than it was before? There are people who, when they got born again, could dance vigorously during praise and worship, not caring if anyone was looking at them. Now, they can't even shout hallelujah at the top of their voices. No matter how big a fellow is, he or she is still nothing before God. If a person is too big to dance for Him, He can decide to show that fellow how small he or she really is.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One day, I asked God, “Lord, David did a lot of terrible things, even more than Saul, yet You said David was a man after Your heart while You rejected Saul. I know that You are not partial, but I am curious to know why.” He responded, “What did David do in 2 Samuel 6:14?” I replied, “He danced with all his might.” Then He asked, “Can you show me a place in the Bible where Saul danced for me?” That was when I really knew why God rejected Saul. It is not so much about dancing; rather, it is about the heart of a man after God has raised him. David's love for God increased as he went higher, while Saul's love reduced as he went higher. Which of these two are you?&nbsp;</p><p><br>If a believer's love for God is reducing, such a believer is not far off from offending Him, and that might result in God rejecting the fellow. If you don't believe me, read Philippians 1:9-10:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>May your love for God keep increasing for the rest of your life, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>Do&nbsp;you know that it is possible to commit God to do some things for you and leave Him with no choice but to do them? Psalm 115:3 says that God is sovereign, He does as He pleases, but if you know Him well, you can position yourself such that the Almighty will do what you want.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Going by today's memory verse, if you can find what God's word says about what you want and align yourself with it, He will be committed to doing His part. For example, Psalm 75:6-7 says that promotion comes from God. 1 Samuel 2:7-8 also says that God decides whom to raise and whom to bring down. Since you know this, the question now becomes, “How do I get God to promote me?” The answer is in 1 Peter 5:6:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>Therefore, if you notice that it seems like it is taking a long time for God to promote you, then you can make up your mind to be humble. Once you are humble, He will be committed to exalting you in order to fulfil His word. Proverbs 22:29 says that if you are diligent in your business, you will stand before kings. Proverbs 12:24 also says that the hand of the diligent shall bear rule. Therefore, if you want to get to the very top, you must add diligence to your humility, and in line with God's word, He will raise you so high that you will be in the category of kings. You can get God to do what you want if you do what He wants.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil, however, also knows this principle. When he doesn't want God to do something for you, he tempts you to do something wrong so that he can accuse you before God and commit God not to bless you. This is why Revelation 12:10 calls him the accuser of the brethren. He knows that God will not go against His word, so he tempts you into committing sin and accuses you before God. This is why it is foolish to obey the one who has decided to destroy you by committing sin. When next the devil tempts you, tell him, “I refuse to be a fool.”</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Beloved, never give the devil the opportunity to use God's word against you, rather, use God's word to your favour by always praying according to His will.</p>",

      "<p>Many people ask God for mercy, but when God looks into their lives and sees that they don't show mercy to others around them, He withholds His mercy. From our memory verse today, you will realise that if you are merciful to others, you will also enjoy God's mercy. Psalm 130:3 says that if God were to count our iniquities, we will not stand. It is only by His mercy that we are still alive, and if we are wise, we will also have mercy on those around us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In our Bible reading for today, Jesus Christ told the story of a man who owed the king ten thousand talents. The king commanded that he and his family be sold in order to pay the debt, but the man asked for mercy, and the king forgave him of the debt. The same man went out and saw someone that owed him a hundred pence. His debtor begged for a little more time to pay his debt, but this man refused to forgive the debtor and locked him in prison. The king heard about it, withdrew his mercy, and gave the unmerciful servant to tormentors. Proverbs 11:17 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Scripture above says that when you are merciful, you are doing good to yourself, but if you are cruel, you are hurting yourself because your cruelty will only rob you of the mercies of God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In John 14:23, Jesus said if you love Him, His Father will love you, and both of them will come and dwell in you. How do you show God that you love Him? 1 John 4:21 says that if you love God, then you must love your brother. Love your neighbour like yourself because you cannot say you love God and hate your neighbour. If you decide not to love your neighbour, you are telling God that you don't need His love. Galatians 6:7 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;<br>Whatever you sow is what you will reap. If you sow mercy into the lives of others, you will reap mercy. However, if you decide to sow unforgiveness, then do not complain when you reap unforgiveness (Job 4:8).</p>",

One day, I said to him, “You've been president for almost seven years, and you've never given me anything since.” He looked at me and said, “You've never asked.” I replied, “Friends don't ask. If we are friends, I don't need to ask you. A friend gives to his or her friend without him or her asking.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>When lovers are in a courtship and there is no exchange of gifts between them, no matter how small, that love might just be questionable because one of the major ways of demonstrating love is by giving (John 3:16).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many people claim to be God's friends, but from their reaction when it comes to giving to God, you will realise that they are not. Real friends of God will not wait until an announcement is made for offerings to be made to God before giving to Him. Real friends of God will constantly look for ways to give to Him because of how much they love Him.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I recall a time that I went to minister at a church some years ago, and everyone in the congregation was looking so radiant. By looking at them, you could tell that God had really blessed them. I was thinking about how blessed they were when the minister on the altar said, “It's offering time.” You could see the joy in the auditorium as they all clapped and shouted. Then, God told me, “This is why I have blessed them so much; they give to me cheerfully.” Those who are always happy to give to God, and who don't need to be cajoled or asked before they do so, always enjoy abundant blessings. God sees them as His genuine friends, so He also doesn't wait for them to ask before giving to them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>David was a man who always wanted to give to God. He said in 1 Chronicles 21:24 that he would never give God anything that costs him nothing. As a result, God said that He had given him everything he ever wanted and that if he wanted more, He would have given him (2 Samuel 12:8). He never let him lack anything because he was His friend indeed. God never asked Abraham for a tithe in Genesis 14:20 before Abraham gave it to Him. Nowadays, even after God has said that we should bring tithes into His house (Malachi 3:10-12), some Christians still argue about whether they should pay tithes or not. Such Christians are only pretending to be friends of God.</p>",

      "<p>In&nbsp;my primary school days, our teacher told us the story of a man who offended his king. The king was very angry and called the man concerning the issue. The man immediately got on his knees and pleaded for mercy. He admitted his offence and said that he was very sorry. The king pardoned him because of his repentant heart. Our teacher told us that if we are wrong and admit it while asking for mercy, we will obtain mercy. However, if we try to cover our wrongs, we will surely get punished. The lesson stuck with me, and so, when I do something wrong, I don't try to cover it. If I offend God, I turn to Him and say, “Lord, I have offended you, please have mercy on me.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you want to obtain mercy from God, you must not cover any sins that you commit. The reason God always had mercy on David is that he never tried to cover his sins; rather, he would confess them to God. In 1 Chronicles 21:1-16, when Gad came to tell David that he had offended God, not only did David accept his wrong, he called the elders to fast and pray with him for forgiveness. Compare that to Saul in 1 Samuel 15:20-21. After Samuel had come to tell him that he had not carried out God's instruction to the letter, he made excuses instead of accepting his wrong. When Samuel refused to worship God with him, he did not plead with him to help appease God, rather, he pulled Samuel's skirt just because he didn't want the elders to see Samuel walking away from him. He clearly wasn't making the sacrifice to ask for mercy, he was doing it to cover his sin and make everything look alright. 1 Samuel 3:19 tells us that God honoured Samuel and never allowed his words to fall to the ground, but in 1 Samuel 16:1, as much as Samuel pleaded for Saul, God said that he should not waste his time because He had rejected Saul.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, covering your sins will land you in destruction. When you do something wrong, don't try to keep up appearances. Your Christian life is not about publicity, it is more of your personal relationship with the King of kings. Confess your sins and plead with God for mercy. When you do that, He will have mercy on you, but if you cover your sins, you are risking His total rejection.</p>",

In other words, wisdom is the most important thing you can get.&nbsp;</p><p><br>More interestingly, the Bible reading for today tells us that wisdom is crying in the streets:&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</strong></i> Proverbs 1:20&nbsp;</p><p><br>Unfortunately, many people ignore the cry of wisdom and are not interested in her. People who do not heed the cry of wisdom usually suffer the consequences of being foolish, and it may be too late by the time they realise it. For people who will let wisdom pour out her spirit on them and teach them her words, she always makes herself available, and they are tremendously blessed for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am sure you are asking yourself, “How can I get wisdom?” Psalm 111:10 says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If you want to be wise, the place to start from is to fear God and prove that you fear Him. Proverbs 16:6 says that the fear of the Lord is to depart from evil. Every time people commit sin, they are simply displaying foolishness. Daniel 2:20-22 says that it is God who gives wisdom to the wise. If a fellow does not have a relationship with God, he or she cannot get wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p><br>James 1:5 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>The way to get wisdom is first to fear God and then simply ask Him for wisdom; it is as simple as that. Now, because wisdom is the correct application of knowledge, the limit to your wisdom will be how limited you are in knowledge. As you ask God for wisdom, you must also increase in knowledge so that you will keep increasing in wisdom. This is why I am always reading books. I want to learn something new every day, even if I have to ask someone to teach me.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, wisdom indeed is the principal thing.

Therefore, you must train the ones who will carry on from where you stop. Sometimes you will need to leave some of the things you are doing now to train them because you must invest in the 'future you'.

Some people say that they have multiple fathers; such people are bastards because no human being can have more than one father. The role of your spiritual father in your life is very important. Even though Elijah said that Elisha, his spiritual son, had asked for a hard thing, he practically committed God to give a double portion of his spirit to him (2 Kings 2:9-15). That is a good example of the role a spiritual father can play in a fellow's destiny.</p><p><br>If you claim to have a spiritual father, you must do some things to prove it. If you are disobedient to your spiritual father, you are not his true child, and you cannot get thethings that you expect to get from him. Also, a grown-up child will take care of his parents. If you don't sow anything, either in the form of service or material resources, into the life of your spiritual father, God will not recognise that relationship. 2 Kings 3:11 says that Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah. That is what made their father-son relationship valid and qualified Elisha to get the double portion of his father's spirit.</p><p><br>One night, during my prayer walk, some people met me and asked me to pray with them.

The money was not much, but he showed that I am truly his father so he could get something from me. When Isaacasked Esau to prepare food for him, it was not because he was hungry or that he could not afford to feed himself, he was telling the young man, “Spoil me so that I can blessyou from my heart.” There are blessings that come from the heart of your father; such blessings can never be reversed, as we see in Genesis 27:33-37.</p><p><br>Do what will make your spiritual father so willing to bless you that, even if what you ask for is beyond his control, he will commit God to give it to you.</p>",

      "<p><i><strong>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</strong></i> Job 22:28</p><p><br>The Bible verse above says that whatever you decree will be established unto you. This means that you must be careful about what you decree because they will come to pass. This is why I am always concerned when I see parents who say negative things over their children carelessly. Proverbs 22:15 says that there is foolishness in the heart of a child; I know some children can be naughty, however, the way you respond to their behaviour will go a long way in determining whether those children will turn out good or become worse.</p><p><br>As a parent, how do you respond to your children's behaviours? Do you make negative pronouncements like, “You are useless; you can't amount to anything,” or positivedeclarations like, “You are for signs and wonders. It doesn't matter what the devil may try, you will succeed.” Whatever you say is what will happen. There is power in your tongue and this power is even more potent over your children because they came into the world through you. As a parent, God has given you power over the future of your children, not so that you can destroy it, but so that you can shape theminto what He wants them to become.</p><p><br>In our Bible reading for today, Jacob came to Isaac and got a blessing. As soon as he left, Esau came in, and Isaac told him that he had blessed Jacob and that he will be blessed. Whatever you speak over your children, especially when your emotions are stirred up, will stick and will be reinforced. After Jacob got the blessings and was on the run, he encountered God in Genesis 28:12-22, and God didn't say anything about the fact that he cheated. He didn't say, “You cheated your brother and you will pay for it.” I thought that Jacob would have been scolded, but God established the blessing he got from his father.</p><p><br>Beloved, please decree good things over your children. Whether they hurt you or not, remember that whatever you say will happen to them. Don't say something that will affect them negatively; you will regret it later. You will account for every word you speak over your children, and whatever they become will reflect on you also. Speak blessings over your children at all times.</p>",

      "<p>Many people pursue success, and that is good. However, being successful has its own challenges. Success has destroyed many people in the past because they were not prepared for the challenges that come with it. Over the next few days, I will be sharing some of the challenges that come with attaining success with you. I may not be able to share all of them with you in this series, but I hope that what you learn will help you prepare for success because you will be successful unto the end, in Jesus' name.</p><p><br>The first challenge of success is pride. In Genesis 48:1-20, the blessing of the firstborn was transferred to Ephraim by his grandfather, and as a result, he became greater than his elder brother, Manasseh. Pride set in, and God kept pleading with him, but he wasn't listening. Then, in Hosea 4:16-19, God said that Ephraim should be left alone. By the time we get to Hosea 5:9, God said, “Ephraim shall be desolate.” In Revelation 7:5-8, when the various tribes of Israel were being sealed, Ephraim was no longer there. The pride that came with Ephraim's success ended up destroying him.</p><p><br>Proverbs 16:18 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</strong></i></p><p><br>Those who are down can fear no fall. The higher you go, the more cautious you should be of falling, and that caution should drive you to be more humble as you rise.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>James 4:6 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</strong></i></p><p><br>It is only by God's grace that you are able to attain and sustain success. If you become proud, God will withdraw His grace, and the result of that will be disgrace. Don't let God resist you; don't allow pride into your heart. Do everything to ensure that you don't think of yourself as more important than you really are. Don't look down on others, and don't see anything as being too low for you. Let Matthew 20:26-28 keep ringing in your head, that the one who will be the greatest must be the servant of all.</p><p><br>Jesus Christ showed us an example of service and humility in John 13:1-17. He also told us clearly that this is the way to greatness in God's kingdom (Luke 22:24-27). Beloved, seek to serve more than to be served so that God will continue to lift you up.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I started sharing about the challenges of success, and I focused on pride. Today, I will look at another major challenge of success, which is the fact that everybody wants to be friends with the successful. When you are successful, you will have manypeople around you, and it will be difficult to tell those that have good intentions apart from those that do not.</p><p><br>The mere fact that you are at the top will attract many 'friends' to you. This is why you must be careful to put your trust in God and not man. Some people will do everythingto work their way into your heart just because of what they want to get from you. You will need the gift of discernment of spirits to know those that are genuine and those that are not.</p><p><br>In 2 Samuel 13:4-5, Jonadab advised Prince Amnon like he really cared about him. Amnon went ahead and did as he advised. When the repercussion of that evil counselcame, Jonadab did not rise up to defend his friend; he was the one who went to announce Amnon's death to David (2 Samuel 13:32-33). He told the king, “Let the king cheer up, for Amnon only is dead.” If Amnon had been wise, he would have seen earlier that Jonadab was not a real friend. Real friends will not always say 'yes' to your desires.Sometimes, they will say 'no' because they care about you. When you have people who never tell you the hard truth and who will keep supporting you, even when you are clearly going the wrong way, run from such people.</p><p><br>The higher you go, the more careful you have to become in choosing the kind of people you allow into your life. If you are trying not to be lonely as you go higher, and youkeep many friends, you will end up having many with negative intentions around you. You should have fewer friends as you go higher, not because you don't like beingfriendly, but because you will discover that most people care more about what you can give them than who you are to them. As a result, your circle of friends shouldbecome really small as you advance in life. For example, I had more friends when I was not yet General Overseer than I have now.</p><p><br>Beloved, I pray that God will give you the grace to discern between those that are really your friends and those that are wolves in sheep's clothing.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will conclude the teaching on the challenges of being successful by looking at the temptation to enjoy the praises of men and not returning the glory to God. When you become successful, people will shower you with a lot of praise and might even give you glory for things that you didn't do. For example, after David killed Goliath, some womenbegan singing, “Saul killed his thousands, David his ten thousands,” even though it was clear that it was God who gave him victory over Goliath. This got David in trouble with Saul and Saul began seeking to kill him (1 Samuel 18:6-9).</p><p><br>Beware of the praises of men. Sometimes you will not be able to stop them, but you must pay no attention to them because the moment you start doing so, you will begin to feel like you are on top of the world, and before you know it, you will be taking the glory instead of giving it to God. It was the praises of men that got Herod in trouble such that he was eaten up by worms in the presence of those who were praising him (Acts 12:22-23).</p><p><br>The praises of men can become so addictive that you will want to hear them all the time. King Saul wanted to please the people all the time so that they could keep praising him, even to the point of disobeying God (1 Samuel 15:24). When you are doing well, people will praise you as if you are the best in the world. You should beware,because the moment you get so addicted to their praise and it drives you outside God's will, you will realise that you are just mere dust.</p><p><br>There was a man that was regarded as being almost as powerful as my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, in those days. He, however, let the praises of the peopleget into his head and eventually broke away with a large chunk of the church. By the time he died, he had a congregation of less than 50 people. 1 Corinthians 10:11 tells us that certain things happened to some people so that we can learn from them. Don't listen to the praises of people, as they will make you start doing things that you will end up regretting if you are not careful. Remember, those shouting ‘Hosanna’ today, can turn around to shout ‘crucify him’ tomorrow. The praises of men are too volatile to be trusted.</p>",

      "<p>There is a powerful lesson in 2 Kings 2:1-15 that I will like you to pay attention to. Elijah gave Elisha a condition to meet in order to get the double portion in spite of the fact that he had been serving Elijah for so long. If Elisha had not met that single condition, he would have gotten nothing from his father at his departure. Many people think that getting blessed by a powerful man of God is enough to make them great. Yes, the blessing is powerful, but if a person does not wrestle out his or her greatness, such a fellow will remain on the same level. Your father may have settled some things on your behalf, but you still have your own individual wrestling to do if you want to access those things.</p><p><br>In Genesis 27:26-30, Isaac blessed Jacob with an irreversible blessing. For sure, Jacob was going to be great, however, he had to wrestle to get the change of name that set him up for the benefits of the blessings he had received (Genesis 32:1-30). Many rich people's children think that because their parents are rich, they can never be poor.History is full of examples of people whose parents were very rich but who ended up poor. If you don't wrestle out your own greatness, you will eventually lose whateverinheritance is laid down for you. Some pastors' children think that their parents' anointing makes them immune to the devil and assures them of making heaven. However, Ezekiel 18:20 says that the soul that sinneth shall die. If you are a sinner, your father's righteousness or anointing cannot cover you. You must meet God for yourself and build a relationship with Him if you want to enjoy the benefits of what your father carries.</p><p><br>Without Pa Josiah Akindayomi, you might not know Adeboye today. I have always thanked God that when I got born again, it was in RCCG. God brought me to acovenant church, and I rode on that covenant to become who I am today. However, even though the covenant is there, if I did not wrestle it out, I would never havesucceeded. I had to fast, pray, keep vigils, and work very hard. I made sacrifices, and I am still doing so today because I know that the covenant will go to waste if I don'twrestle things out by myself. Beloved, if you want to experience the blessings that God has arranged to help you succeed, get ready to wrestle them out yourself.</p>",

Befocused.</p><p><br>The devil will try to put many weights on you to distract you, but you must stay focused. People may criticise you, lie against you, and say negative things about you, but you must remain focused. Some years ago, people were criticising me almost everywhere.

On his right-hand side, the king asked some other people to stand and keep praising and hailing the man until he got to the finish line. The man started walking, and the people on both sides did what they were told to do with all their strength. At last, the man got to the finish line without spilling any water. The king asked him, “Which of these people helped you succeed?” He responded, “None of them. I was carrying my life in my hands, and so I did not listen to either of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you are carrying your life in your hands; don't let anyone make you lose your focus.</p>",

He said in Exodus 23:10-11 that even the land should be cultivated for six years and then be made to rest in the seventh year. We all need to take a break every now and then so that we can be refreshed enough to be effective at what He has called us to do.</p><p><br>Many people break down because they hardly take breaks. Some people have been working for years without taking any vacation. What they don't understand is that taking time to rest will help them to be more effective when they resume their work. In 1 Kings19:1-8, Elijah had just called fire down from heaven and brought revival to the land. Then, he heard that Jezebel wanted to kill him and ran for his life. By the time he got to the juniper tree, he was tired, and in that state, he asked God to kill him. God knew that he really didn't want to die; he just needed to take a break. He made him fall asleep and sent an angel to feed him twice. After resting and eating well, he was strengthened to continue for the next 40 days. Sometimes, the reason you feel frustrated is that you have not taken a break in a while. Just try sleeping and eating only for one day, and you will see the difference.</p><p><br>Taking a break is not expensive. If you don't have money to travel or check into a hotel, you can go to a family member's house or any quiet place where you know that no one will disturb you, and just rest there. You need to rest weekly and yearly also, especially after a strenuous period of work, as Elijah did in 1 Kings 18. No matter how anointed you are, as long as you are still in the flesh, you need to take a break once in a while. The only reason I have been able to host the Holy Ghost Service every month for almost 40 years is that I take breaks when necessary. After every major programme that lasts for at least one week, I take a break and get some good rest. Don't wait for a doctor to put you on bed rest because by then, it will be more expensive, and you will have no choice but to rest for a longer time than you want to.</p>",

You may think that Jesus was being unfair to the tree, but He was sending a message to us with that act. You must never wait for the right conditions before you begin to bear fruits for your Master.</p><p><br><i><strong>He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</strong></i> Ecclesiastes 11:4</p><p><br>If God has given a believer an assignment, he or she should work towards it whether the conditions are right or not. If such believers keep waiting for the right conditions, they will never achieve their goals or fulfil their destiny. If you keep observing the wind, you will not sow, and if you have already sown, if you keep observing the clouds, you will not reap. You must set out to bear fruit even when the conditions around you do not suggest that you should.</p><p><br>When I became the General Overseer of RCCG, I got many promises from God apart from the covenant that God had with my Father in the Lord about the church's great future. All the conditions surrounding the church at that time were not palatable. We did not even have enough money to pay the General Overseer's salary, not to talk of getting money to establish parishes around the world or hosting large meetings where millions of people will gather. Even though the conditions did not look right, I still set out to do the things that God called me to do. When we moved to Redemption City, we did not have money to pay labourers to build the auditorium, not to talk of building a city. I worked every night with other members of the church to build the first auditorium. Today, everyone can see the city that God promised us.</p><p><br>Beloved, if you wait for perfect conditions before you bear fruit, you will be just like that fig tree, and I am quite sure that you don't want to end up like it because Jesus said in our memory verse for today that any branch in Him that does not bear fruit will be cut off.</p>",

In other words, an evidence gives the claimant confidence.</p><p><br><i><strong>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</strong></i> Hebrews 11:1</p><p><br>The above passage says that faith is the evidence of things not seen. If your faith is really an evidence, you will be confident about your claims concerning God's word and the things that you pray about, just like the claimant in the example I shared above. You will not pray for something today and speak in doubt about the same thing tomorrow.</p><p><br>When you pray, you must believe with all your heart that what you have prayed for is already settled (Mark 11:24). It is only then that you can see your prayers answered. Doubt must not be allowed in your heart at all. A little doubt will contaminate your faith and may hinder you from getting what you are praying for. Matthew 21:21 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</strong></i></p><p><br>Beware, however, because the devil will try to send fear into your heart. He will give you every reason for your miracle not to come, but you must attack him with the word of God. Romans 10:17 says: <i><strong>“…faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”</strong></i> Whenever doubtful thoughts come, recite the word of God that counters it over and over again until the word drowns the doubts. In Joshua 1:8, the Bible says that to have good success, the word of God must never depart from your mouth. Note that it did not say from your heart but from your mouth.</p><p><br>Beloved, if you desire anything in your life, pray about it in faith and declare God's word concerning it without any doubts.</p>",

      "<p>For everything we do, whether it is something we are saying, an action we are taking, or a decision we are making, there is a spirit within us influencing it. In Matthew 16:13-23, Peter was saying to Jesus Christ in one moment that He is the Christ, to which Jesus Christ said flesh and blood could not have revealed it to him, implying that only the Spirit of God could have revealed that to him. Not long after, the same Peter said to the Lord, “You will not die,” and the Lord turned to him and said, “Get thee behind me satan.” This tells us that we must always check what spirit is influencing our actions. You can be a powerful man of God, filled with the Holy Ghost, and still be influencedby the devil.</p><p><br>When you read in 1 John 4:1 that you should test all spirits, don't just conduct tests on the spirits in other people; conduct a test on the spirit influencing you too. Check the things that you are doing, saying and believing; check if they are in line with the Spirit of God.<br>How do you check what spirit is influencing you? Matthew 7:16-17 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</strong></i></p><p><br>Check the fruits you are bearing. Check if they are in line with the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If what you are doing does not show love, you are not being influenced by the Spirit of God. If you are doing something that is opposed to peace, it is another spirit influencing you. If a Christian decides to do something outside the will of God because he or she does not want to suffer for God's will, he or she is following the will of the devil.</p><p><br>Beloved, you must always check what spirit is influencing you at every point in time. Agood way to know is to check if your decisions and actions are in line with the variousexpressions of the fruit of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5:22-23. If you are not born again, you should surrender your life to Christ so that you can be influenced by His Spirit. If you are a Christian and your decisions and actions do not reflect the fruit of the spirit, retrace your steps to being influenced by the Spirit of God only.</p>",

      "<p>The Bible says you should seek God while He may be found and call on Him while He is near. Once you hear that, the next question on your mind should be, “How do I know when God may be found or when He is near?” That question is very valid. However, what you really need to know is how to draw Him near to you. John 4:23-24 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</strong></i></p><p><br>The Scripture above tells me that rather than trying to seek God while He may be found when I cannot even see Him, if I worship Him in spirit and in truth, He will be the One to seek me out. Instead of me calling Him without knowing whether He is near or far, if I just concentrate on worshipping Him, He will draw near to me. If you want God to always be near you, you must be committed to worshipping Him like no one else does. He is drawn to people that worship Him. Psalms 22:3 says that God inhabits the praises of Israel. Israel here refers to those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.</p><p><br>People generally move towards where they are being praised. Where I'm from in the Western part of Nigeria, if you are at a party and the musician suddenly starts singing your praises, it is expected that you will stand on your feet and go towards him or her dancing. That is what happens when we sing praises to God; He draws near us. This is one major secret that David knew, which made God answer His prayers. He said that whenever he wanted to approach God, he went in with praises and thanksgiving (Psalms 100:4). By the time he had praised and thanked God for a while, he will find himself in the very courts of God. Once he had God near him, he could call on Him and be sure to receive answers to his prayers.</p><p><br>Beloved, henceforth, deliberately draw God close to you at all times with praise and worship.</p>",

You gain nothing from worrying, absolutely nothing. However, when you are a prayer warrior, as issues arise, you will cut them down in the place of prayer because you are a champion that is more than a conqueror (Romans 8:37).</p><p><br>Some people are too anxious about tomorrow. Before they getinto the university, they worry that they may never be admitted. After graduating, they become worried that theymay not get a job. When they get a job, they worry that they may lose the job. If they don't lose the job, they worry that they may not be promoted. When they are promoted, they worry that someone might want to take the position from them. They worry that nobody will marry them. When somebody shows up to marry them, they worry whether he or she is the right fellow. When they finally get married, they worry about whether they have taken the right decision and if they will ever have children. They are always worrying about the future. Honestly, all that worrying will not solve anything.</p><p><br>When you read Philippians 4:6-7, you will see what you should be doing instead of worrying. It says you should be thanking God in everything by prayer and supplication.</p><p><br><i><strong>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</strong></i></p><p><br>Don't thank God only when things are going the way you like; thank God in everything by prayer and supplication, and then let your requests be known to God. Don't just sit there and worry; go to God in prayer, thank Him for the things He has done for you, and then make your requests known to Him. His peace will replace every form of worry in your heart. So, rather than worry, pray to God, and He will meet you at the point of your needs.</p><p><br>If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour and have surrendered your life to Him, stop worrying. Jesus has already given you His peace that passes all understanding, as we see in John 14:27:</p><p><br>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

Do you know whom you are talking to? If all these weaklings desert you, you can count on me, Lord.” The Lord said, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me thrice.” He said, “It seems as if you don't know whom you are talking to. Even if I have to die with you, I will die; I can never deny you.” However, in Matthew 26:69-75, who did we find swearing that he did not know Jesus? The same Peter!<br>Whatever a fellow boasts about has power over him or her. This is why the Bible says rejoicing in boasting is evil.</p><p><br><i><strong>But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</strong></i> James 4:16</p><p><br>Once you find yourself boasting about something, watch out, that thing is about to become a tool for the devil to use in bringing you down. This is why you must not boast. The only boasting allowed is boasting in the Lord (1 Corinthians 1:31). That is what David did in 1 Samuel 17:41-47 which led to him defeating Goliath. Even if you feel no one is better than you at something, keep your mouth shut. A man considered to be wiser than all men (1 Kings 4:31) said:</p><p><br><i><strong>Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</strong></i> Proverbs 27:2</p><p><br>Boasting is like being on the battlefield and telling the enemy how to strike and defeat you. You may think you are talking about your strength, but every wise fellow knows that the moment you boast about something, it becomes your weakness. Goliath was boasting before he got struck down by a mere teenager with a catapult. Nebuchadnezzar was boasting about his achievements in one moment, and the next moment, he was eating grass in the field like an animal (Daniel 4:28-33).</p><p><br>Beloved, if you have been a boaster, repent now.

When people change their beliefs just because of what one 'man of God' said or because their pastor announced that he had changed his beliefs, without them going to search for the truth in God's word themselves, I know that they are baby Christians or Christians with stunted growth.</p><p><br>Once you find the truth in God's word, don't let what people say shake your faith. Don't let your walk with God be dictated by what people say. You must know God for yourself and let your walk with Him be dependent on your personal relationship with Him. There is nothing compared to having a first-hand experience of who God truly is.

After he experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit, Peter became an entirely different person. In Acts 11:1-18, after he had gone to Cornelius' house and the congregation gathered together to query him for going to a gentile's house, he stood firm as a rock and said, “The Spirit bade me go.” He was no longer scared to stand on what he believed.</p><p><br>Get filled with the Holy Spirit, and you will know the truth of God's word so much that it will be difficult to be deceived by false doctrines.</p>",

      "<p>The Christian walk is very unique. This is because Christianity is dependent on an individual's ability to believe. As a result of this, Christians are generally called 'believers'. A scientist might say, “Prove it to me, and I will believe you,” but in Christendom, God says, “Believe Me, and I will prove it to you.” This is the mystery of Christianity.</p><p><br>To an unbeliever, our faith is proof that we, as Christians, are not wise. This is because a natural man cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2:14). However, in 1 Corinthians 1:27, the Bible tells us that God uses the foolish things of this world to confound the wise. For example, it does not make sense to unbelievers when we say that a virgin gave birth to Jesus Christ. Most times, they think to themselves, “How can a virgin give birth?”</p><p><br>Jesus said something very important in our memory verse for today. He said that only those who are like children will inherit the kingdom. In other words, you must believe Him like a child believes his or her parents, whether what they say makes sense or not. Many people make the mistake of trying to relate with God logically. This is impossible because the Bible says that God's ways and thoughts are beyond human comprehension (Isaiah 55:8-9).</p><p><br>There are people who argue against Christianity with logic. Do not argue with such people because you cannot explain Christianity logically. Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:23-25 to avoid unnecessary arguments with people concerning the truth of God's word.</p><p><br>The way to prove that God is real is not through arguments but by the display of power as Elijah did in 1 Kings 18. Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:20: <i><strong>“For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.”</strong></i> Furthermore, John 4:48 says, <i><strong>“…Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.”</strong></i><strong> </strong>No matter how hard you try, you cannot win anyone to Christ by an argument. Once you have shared the gospel of Christ with unbelievers, commit their hearts to God, as it is only the Holy Spirit that can convict and convert them. Do not argue with them about your Christian faith, rather, ask God to use you for signs and wonders so that when they see the power of God, they will surrender without any argument.</p><p><br>Beloved, I pray that the power of God will be evident in your life and that He will use you to lead many people into His kingdom, in Jesus' name.</p>",

For instance, many Christians miss out on the fact that Elisha and Elijah were talking as they walked together in 2 Kings 2:11. When I studied that Scripture, I wondered what their discussion was about. Also, in Daniel 3, when the three Hebrew men were with the fourth man in the fire, what were they talking about? What did Jesus discuss with Moses and Elijah in Matthew 17:1-9? What was so crucial that they came down from heaven to discuss with Jesus? In 2 Corinthians 12:1-4, Paul said that he heard words that were not lawful for a man to speak. What were those words?

The Bible says that the entrance of His word always brings light to the hearer and to situations (Psalm 119:130). You cannot live an effective Christian life if you do not hear from God. The Bible teaches that if you believe, you will see the glory of God (John 11:40). However, this faith comes by hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17). Psalm 107:20 says, “He sent His word, and He healed and delivered them.” The question is, how do you receive God's word?</p><p><br>To receive God's word effectively, ensure that nothing distracts you and that you are totally focused on listening to His word. Move away from distractions, so that you can hear exactly what God wants to say to you in that moment. Also, pray for God to open your spiritual ears so that you can understand what is being said.</p><p><br>In Revelations 2:29, the Bible says that those that have ears should hear what the spirit is saying.

Up until today, I still wish that I was there to hear what he wanted to tell me at that crucial moment in his life.</p><p><br>In John 3:16, Jesus said that God loves the whole world and sent Him to die for everyone, but when He was saying His last prayers in John 17:9, He said, “I'm not praying for the world, I'm only praying for these people that You have given me.” This means that if a fellow is not born again, he or she cannot experience certain benefits of God’s love. As a matter of fact, Jesus Christ said that He will deny such a fellow before His Father on the day of judgement (Matthew 10:32-33).</p><p><br>Those of us that are truly born again must also pay close attention to Jesus' last words before His crucifixion and death. In His final prayer before His arrest and crucifixion, He said:</p><p><br><i><strong>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</strong></i> John 17:20-21</p><p><br>It is very important to Jesus Christ, the Head of the church, that believers are united. God's glory can only be seen upon the church when there is unity and when Christians are of the same mind. In Psalm 133, the Bible tells us that God's anointing and blessings will flow freely within His church when we are united as brethren. You should not hold grudges or keep malice with your brothers and sisters in Christ. Even though a Christian belongs to another denomination and you have a disagreement, bear in mind that you both belong to God, and all Christians are His children.</p><p><br>Beloved, ensure that you always show love to the Christians around you in spite of your differences. Make up your mind to honour the last words of your Lord and Saviour by striving for unity with other believers (Ephesians 4:1-3).</p>",

      "<p>Elderly people carry valuable gems of wisdom. No matter how educated you are, some lessons cannot be learnt in classrooms; they are only taught in the 'classroom of life' and are learned by experience. Even though I have a PhD, I have learnt to defer to the wisdom of the elders from time to time. This is why you will always hear me say, “The elders have a saying,” because there are valuable things that I have learnt from the elders that all of my formal education did not give me.</p><p><br>I was privileged to sit at the feet of my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi. Every week, I would visit him to ask questions, and he would teach me valuable lessons. I was also privileged to learn from Pa S.G Elton. Every two weeks, I would travel to Ilesha to sit at his feet. He taught me many things, even though I didn't agree with some of them initially because I felt that they were incorrect. However, as I grew older, I began to realise that he was correct. One of the things he taught me was that I should always remember that I am not God, irrespective of the level of the anointing that I operate in. He also taught me that God does whatever He pleases, and all that I have to do is to take my burdens to Him in prayer and go to bed. This is why, if you ask those close to me, they will tell you that I have no difficulty sleeping. No matter how big the problem is, once I have prayed, I go to sleep.</p><p><br>Beloved, even if your parents and the elders around you are not as educated or sophisticated as you are, listen to them. Whatever things you disagree with or that seem hard for you to understand, keep them in your memory regardless. One day, when you are wiser, you will likely refer to them. Do not joke with the moments you have to spend with elders, whether they are related to you or not. Tell them to teach you some of the things they know and do. Some natural remedies to sicknesses died with some elders because the generation after them did not learn about them when they had the opportunity. Some important principles of life have also been lost in this manner.</p><p><br>Learn all you can from the elderly ones, especially the Christian elders that you still have around you, before they go to be with the Lord.</p>",

If God has been talking to you and you have been disobedient, He will keep quiet, and you won't hear Him again.</p><p><br>You need to hear God so that He can guide you. The primary way to hear from God and be guided by Him is to study your Bible. However, what should you do when the situation you need guidance about is not specifically addressed by the Bible? Whenever you need to make decisions on such matters, you need to hear from God directly.</p><p><br>There are times when you can clearly see what God wants you to do in the Scriptures. However, you still need to hear from Him on how to go about what He wants you to do. For example, when Paul wanted to go to Asia in Acts 16:6-7, the Spirit of God forbade him. You might ask, “How can the Spirit of God stop Paul from going to preach since it is written in Matthew 28:19 that we should go into the world and teach every nation?”</p><p><br>Some years ago, I wanted to hold a crusade in Benin, a state capital in Southern Nigeria. We had prepared everything for the crusade, but to my surprise, when I went to ask God about it, He said that we should go to Ede, a town in South-West Nigeria instead. I told Him that we had just concluded a crusade in Ilesha, another town in the same state as Ede and that the inhabitants of Ede would have most likely been in attendance. However, since God is my Commander-in-chief, I obeyed Him.</p><p><br>During the crusade in Ede, the king was in attendance, and when he got on the stage to speak, he announced that he would be gifting the church with whatever quantity of land we desired. We initially decided to ask for 50 acres of land, however, when I went back to hear from God, He told me to ask for 500 hectares, and I obeyed. Today, that portion of land is where Redeemer's University and The Redeemed Christian School of Missions are situated. If I had hardened my heart, I wouldn't have gone to Ede, and I wouldn't have received the blessing.</p><p><br>Beloved, when you are dealing with God, don't harden your heart.

      "<p>Sometimes, when you hear from God, it may be a rebuke. However, you must still open your heart to Him despite the rebuke. In any case, I would rather God rebuke me than stay silent. If a Christian only wants to hear sweet things from God but never wants to listen to His rebuke, he or she will eventually stop hearing from Him. You should be glad when God rebukes you because Hebrews 12:6 says that it is the child the father loves that he chastens. When David was rebuked in 2 Samuel 12:1-14, he did not harden his heart, rather, he repented, and God continued to walk with him.</p><p><br>How do you react when you hear a rebuke from your pastor? Do you harden your heart or do you make amends immediately? No matter how influential a believer is in ministry, or how gifted the fellow is in the Holy Spirit, if such a person hardens his or her heart against God's rebuke, God can reject such a believer (1 Samuel 16:1). Psalm 51:17says:</p><p><br><i><strong>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</strong></i></p><p><br>If you want God to keep walking with you and speaking to you, you need to have a broken spirit and a contrite heart. God is not moved by mere religious activity; He is most interested in a relationship with you. However, just as it is impossible to have a good relationship with someone that you cannot correct when he or she offends you, God will not dwell with hard-hearted individuals. He said in Isaiah 57:15:</p><p><br><i><strong>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</strong></i></p><p><br>Beloved, when God rebukes you, whether through His word, a fellow believer, or directly by Himself, never harden your heart. Hardening your heart against His rebuke will only lead to destruction as we see in Proverbs 29:1:</p><p><br><i><strong>He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</strong></i></p><p><br>Do not despise rebuke from God, rather, embrace His correction as evidence of His love for you.</p>",

However, what do fathers stand to gain from their children in the Lord? When you consider the fact that there was a school of prophets in Israel, where Elijah could have gotten many people to help him, you will realise that he did not really need Elisha.</p><p><br>The primary reason a father sticks close to his children in the Lord is usually that he wants to pass his knowledge and anointing to them. He does not want everything he has gotten from God to die with him; he wants to pass them on to people that will carry on after he is gone. Thus, it is the willingness of fathers to teach, and their children in the Lord to learn, that builds such a strong bond between them. Just as in the case of Elijah and Elisha in 2 Kings 2:11, fathers will one day be taken from the earth, and theirchildren in the Lord will be faced with the reality of carrying on to greater heights without them. How ready are you for the time you will need to carry on from yourfather in the Lord?</p><p><br>Your vision in your walk with God must go beyond your father in the Lord, otherwise, when he is gone, your walk with God may be affected.

However, he told me that he never fasted beyond 21 days at a stretch. Not long after he went to be with the Lord, I moved beyond that and started fasting for 40 days at a go once every year. He saw the Church spreading across the world, and that has come to pass, however, God has further expanded the vision to other areas like establishing the Redeemer’s University where young people can obtain a university degree and be equipped spiritually while doing so.</p><p><br>If you want your father in the Lord to be proud of you, while you are learning all you can from him before he leaves the earth, you must also see beyond him in your daily walk with God.</p>",

When he saw me in that state, he said, “Why are you fasting so much when you already have the biggest auditorium in Africa?

      "<p>Today, I will continue the teaching I started yesterday on vision. Beloved, I want you to know that your future depends on what you can see today. If you see a glorious future, you can have it (Genesis 13:15). When we acquired The Redemption Camp in Texas, USA, God told me, “As far as you can see, it is yours.” I walked as far as I could that day and today, everything I saw has become ours – I wish I had walked farther! God has put so much power in your vision that it attracts whatever it is focused on. Therefore, you must be very conscious about what you set your eyes on. The Bible says in Colossians 3:2:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</strong></i></p><p><br>Your eyes must be set on things above, and not on worldly things. Even when flashy things surround you, your vision must remain glued to things above. My wife and I visited a wealthy man, and he showed us a house he was building. That was the first time that I saw a tap made of gold in a bathroom. Right there, my wife heard God say, “Daughter, heaven is far more beautiful.” In 2 Timothy 4:6-8, Apostle Paul was joyful about the crown of righteousness that was laid up for him. While other people saw death, he saw a coronation. This is why he said in 2 Corinthians 11:22-33 that he endured beatings, hunger, and all manners of sufferings; it was because of the things He had seen.</p><p><br>Beloved, don't put your focus on earthly possessions and titles. If all you see are perishable things, all you will get will be perishable. This is why the Bible tells us in Matthew 6:19-20 that we should lay our treasures in heaven where they cannot be destroyed. On the other hand, if you see beyond perishable things, you will get both the perishable things and things that are imperishable. This is what the Bible says in Matthew 6:33:</p><p><br><i><strong>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</strong></i></p><p><br>The only limit to what you can lay hold on in the future is what you can see today. The things you can see will drive you to take all the necessary steps to attain them. Beloved, there is nothing better than setting your eyes on God because when you have Him, you have everything else.</p>",

In today's Bible reading, Laban agreed to give Jacob all the speckled sheep in his flock as wages. However, because he wanted to cheat him, he secretly removed all the speckled sheep, leaving only plain-coloured sheep within the flock. Despite this, Jacob peeled tree barks and made marks on them. He placed the marked barks at the place the sheep usually drank from so that whenever they came to drink, they would see them. He also ensured that the animals faced the marked barks whenever they were mating. Before long, the plain-coloured sheep started producing speckled offspring until the speckled sheep were more than the plain-coloured ones within the flock. Jacob changed the DNA of the sheep by changing what they saw.</p><p><br>2 Corinthians 3:18 says that as we keep looking at Jesus Christ, we are transformed into His image.

Deliberately fix your attention on the things and people that will influence you to become what you intend to become in the future.</p><p><br>The first time I went to South Korea to attend Dr. Yonggi Cho's church, I saw that they held seven services in a fifty thousand seater capacity auditorium on that Sunday. They had to beg those who had come to the services that day not to come the following week. I saw something that depicted what I wanted to become, and so I took that vision to God and cried to Him about it. Some years later, I went back there and this time, I was able to meet with him and he said, “I have heard of you, will you please pray for me?” I caught a vision the first time I went there and God began to align things to make me become what I saw. When I went back, I was a different person. If you have a vision and you remain focused on it, you will become what you see in your vision.</p><p><br>Lastly, what you indulge in will determine your destiny. In Judges 16, Samson kept indulging in the wrong things. He kept visiting harlots and committed all manners ofatrocities; that was why he died young. Gehazi could have become a greater prophet than Elisha, but his love for silver and gold made him end up as a leper (2 Kings 5:25-27).</p><p><br>Beloved, what vision are you holding on to?</p>",

      "<p>The lips are a very sensitive part of the human body. In Isaiah 6:6-7, when the angel wanted to help Isaiah, he put a coal of fire on his lips. Even though that must have been very painful considering how sensitive the lips are, the experience ensured that Isaiah became a changed person.</p><p><br>Nothing touches fire and remains the same. In Acts 2:1-14, Peter stood boldly to address and preach to a large crowd of people after the Holy Ghost had descended on the Upper Room congregation like cloven tongues of fire. This was the same Peter that denied Jesus three times out of fear. From the day a believer gets a kiss of fire, everything about him or her changes completely; the impact of the fire will abide with him or her forever.<br>When you see someone who is always ready to do the will of Christ and go all out for Him, that fellow has been kissed by fire. This is why after Isaiah received that kiss of fire, all he could hear was God saying, “Whom shall we send, who will go for us?” and his response was, “Lord, send me” (Isaiah 6:1-8). When you are kissed by fire, you will begin to hear the heartbeat of God concerning the nations of the world, and your response will be, “Lord, send me anywhere to do your work, and I will go.”</p><p><br>Paul did God's work with great zeal. That zeal came upon him in Acts 9:3-6 when Jesus appeared to him in a great light on his way to Damascus. That light was not from an electric bulb; it was from the fire of God, and the moment Paul's body touched it, he was kissed by fire and was changed forever. From that moment, he went to every length to do the will of God.</p><p><br>The reason many Christians find it difficult to do great exploits for God is that they have not been kissed by fire. Some of them want to serve God in greater capacities, but they lack the required zeal because they have not been kissed by fire. If you are a pastor, and you want to have an army that is willing to join you in doing great exploits for the kingdom, pray for them to be kissed by fire. The moment they are kissed by fire, the zeal of the Lord will take over their hearts and all they will long for is to do His will at all times.</p>",

This particular kind of people seek worldly pleasures onlyand have no self-control. As a matter of fact, they can be likened to zombies. A zombie is a fictional entity that does not have a mind of its own. It is controlled by a basic urge to feed and is literally a dead man walking. If you are always lured by things that give your flesh pleasure, it means that your flesh is ruling over your spirit. This also implies spiritual death. You must gain full control over yourself. Do not let the urge to sleep overcome the need to work. Do not let the urge to eat overcome the need to fast. The key to remaining in control of your life is to be disciplined. The price of discipline far outweighs the cost of indiscipline. A fellow who always gives in to pleasure will die poor. This is what the Bible tells us in Proverbs 21:17:</p><p><br><i><strong>He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</strong></i></p><p><br>Nobody ever achieves anything great by giving in to pleasure all the time. Anyone who does this will come into this world and leave unnoticed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Being a lover of pleasure is so dangerous that the Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 that you should not associate with people who only seek the pleasures of life. It says that you must turn away from people who love pleasure and themselves more than they love God. A tree does not eat its own fruit. It exists to cater for the needs of others. In the same vein, people are created to impact others and contribute positively to society. They are not created to only serve themselves.</p><p><br>When some people talk about self-love, what they are actually talking about is selfishness. If you want to really live, then you must make an impact on those around you. Anyone who is only living for himself or herself is already dying. The best way to impact those around you is to bring them out of darkness into the light of Christ. This is the true essence of living as a Christian, as you were chosen to bear fruits (John 15:16).</p><p><br>Beloved, ensure that you remain truly alive by not only seeking your own good but also the good of others.</p>",

      "<p>We live in a world today where many are confused about their sexuality and gender. Some Christians are also confused about what to believe concerning the topic. Over the next few days, I will be digging deep into the Scriptures to explain the truth about sexuality and gender.</p><p><br>First of all, I will like to emphasise that God created man in His own image, and He created them male and female (Genesis 1:27); anything outside this is not God's design, neither is it His will. When an artist creates a masterpiece, the artist puts his or her signature on it. Every human being is God's masterpiece and is uniquely made, such that no two people in this world have the same fingerprints. If someone takes a masterpiece and decides to change something about it, it immediately ceases to be a masterpiece. People who decide to change their gender are destroying the essence oftheir creation. They are telling God – their creator – that they can do a better job at creating.</p><p><br>One thing I know is that my God does not make mistakes. Therefore, when someone says that she feels like she is a male trapped inside a female body for instance, I immediately know that the devil is at work and is trying to manipulate her to destroy her body which is God's masterpiece. Changing God's original design concerning our bodies can be disastrous because the Bible warns that our bodies are God's temple and that God will destroy whoever defiles His temple (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). There are records of many people who have altered their genders admitting that they are suffering serious health and emotional trauma as a result of their decisions. A person cannot tamper with God's masterpiece and not suffer the consequences if he or she doesnot repent.</p><p><br>One of our pastors was arrested because he addressed a group of people as, “Ladies and gentlemen.” They told him that not all of them were ladies or gentlemen. When I heard this, I wondered, “How many genders did God create?” Your body is the temple of God, and any advice to disfigure it is from the devil. If you feel confused about your identity, draw closer to God, study your Bible, and pray more than ever before. Also, speak to a Christian counsellor who holds firmly to God's position about gender and sexuality. God will show you who you really are in Him and His purpose for your life. He had a plan for you, even before you were formed in your mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:5).</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my teaching on what the Bible says about gender and sexuality. The Bible makes it clear in today's memory verse, that it is an abomination to have sexual relations with someone of the same gender. Homosexuality might have been painted as normal in some societies, but anyone who engages in it is committing an abomination. Today's Bible reading says that if people who engage in homosexuality do not repent, their souls will be cut off from amongst the people. It says further that the nations and places in which such acts are encouraged will be punished and will not know peace. Do not imbibe these ideologies from such societies; the word of God is 'yea' and 'amen'. God's word says that such people and societies will be punished, so we must stay away from their ideologies and intensify our prayers for them.</p><p><br>When you read about Sodom and Gomorrah, the cities that God destroyed with fire and brimstone, you will see what can happen to societies that are defiled by homosexuality (Genesis 19:1-25). Even though they were initially said to be flourishing and seemed like the perfect places to live in (Genesis 13:8-12), they were eventually destroyed due to the wickedness and immoral acts of their inhabitants. Even after they were invaded by enemies and Abraham came to their rescue in Genesis 14:1-16, they continued proudly in their abominations, and this eventually led to their destruction. In Isaiah 3:9, the Bible says:</p><p><br><i><strong>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</strong></i></p><p><br>Beloved, do not partake of such evil rewards. Don't believe the lie that some people are born homosexual. Homosexuality is an abomination before God because it was not part of His original design; it is a devilish act that is intended to destroy the lives of people and tamper with the work of God. If you have been engaging in homosexuality, pray to God for deliverance from the manipulation of the devil, and see a genuine minister of God to pray with you.</p><p>&nbsp;Beloved, God loves you and brought this message to you so that you can either be delivered or be used to deliver others.</p>",

Some years ago, I was in one of the Western nations to preach, and a journalist interviewed me about my views on same-sex marriage. I told the fellow interviewing me that God made men and women to reproduce after their kind. Then I asked, “Is it possible for people of the same gender to produce offspring?” I concluded by telling the interviewer that if everyone was getting married to someone of the same sex, the world will come to an end in this generation.</p><p><br>As a child of God, whenever you have the opportunity to speak about homosexuality, don't beat around the bush. The reason evil thrives is that good people are too afraid to say the truth. Don't keep quiet when people say that they are sexually attracted to people of the same gender as them. Don't judge or condemn them, rather, tell them the truth with love. Condemning them will only make them put up a fight, and our God is not a God of condemnation, but of love. Speak to them in love, but still show them from the Scriptures that what they are feeling is not from God because He clearly speaks against it. Tell them that you are willing to pray with them and help them overcome that feeling.</p><p><br>Today's Bible reading tells us what happens to people when they are left to their reprobate minds; such people cannot end well unless they repent. Stand firm againsthomosexuality and do everything you can to show people that are sexually attracted to individuals of the same sex the right way to live from the Scriptures. Lot stood firm against homosexuality in Genesis 19:1-7, even when he was under severe pressure. He did not allow the men of Sodom to come into his house to have sexual relations with the angels that he invited in, even though they pressed on him greatly and were going to break into his home.</p><p><br>Beloved, I know that in some countries, the government has made it illegal to speak the truth as regards homosexuality. However, we have a greater government in Christ, and we must represent Him everywhere we go. Do not stand by and do nothing while people are on their way to destruction; you have a responsibility to save as many as you can (Jude 1:17-23).</p>",

Do you have a friend who can inject himself with a disease so that you will not be infected with it? This can be likened to what Jesus did in Matthew 8:17. Can any of your friends take a bullet for you? Jesus did more than this when He was beaten by Roman soldiers and hung on a cross. This means that Jesus is the best friend that anyone can ever have.</p><p><br>People often tell tales of friends that they used to have. While it is common for people to betray friendships because of selfish interests or terminate them because of disagreements, the friendship of Jesus Christ lasts forever. Whether you are going through a storm (Matthew 14:24-25), or you are caught in a fire (Daniel 3:22-25), He willnever leave your side.

      "<p><i><strong>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</strong></i> John 16:24</p><p><br>Jesus Christ said in the above passage that it is possible for you to be full of joy. In other words, He was saying that it is possible for you to have absolutely no sorrow. There are many people who look good on the outside but are dying on the inside. A lot of people have sorrows that they can't share and problems that they hide beneath their appearance. However, God can take away sorrows completely and heal the broken-hearted (Psalm 147:3). If you are currently experiencing sorrows or problems that you cannot share, you will be healed today, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p><br>Many years ago, one of my daughters came to me and asked me to pray for her. I asked her what she wanted me to pray about, but she said that I didn't need to know and that when the prayer is answered, she would come back and share the testimony with me. I prayed for her, and to the glory of God, some days later, she came back to share her testimony with me. She was well over 20 years old, but she was still bedwetting. She said that she never travelled with her friends on trips where they had to spend the night together, but that with just a simple prayer, the problem was over. In the name of the Lord Jesus who made it possible for you to be reading this teaching now, if there are any secret sorrows in your life, they will disappear today.</p><p><br>Jesus Christ said in John 16:24 that the way to get all your sorrows turned to so much joy that you will be filled with it, is to ask Him. It may seem like a simple instruction, but it is a very powerful one. Rather than cry or worry, just pray. Matthew 6:27 says that no matter how worried you are, you cannot add an inch to your height.</p><p><br>Beloved, stop worrying. Rather than spending time to worry, use that time to pray. Philippians 4:6 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</strong></i></p><p><br>When disturbing thoughts wake you up at night, get up and pray. As you pray and sing praises to God, the sorrows will be lifted from your heart and will be replaced with joy. I pray that henceforth, your life will be filled with joy, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>As we see in today's Bible reading, the rapture is the sudden taking away of the dead in Christ along with believers who are alive to meet with the Lord Jesus Christ and spend eternity with Him. Many people, however, feel that the rapture is not real because they have heard of it for so long and it hasn't happened yet. Whatever anyone thinks about the reality of the rapture does not matter. It is in your best interest to study and believe only what the word of God says about it. The Bible says that the day will come like a thief in the night and you must be prepared if you do not want to be left behind (1 Thessalonians 5:1-8).</p><p><br>A key characteristic of the major prophecies in the Bible is that they sounded unbelievable when they were spoken. When Isaiah prophesied that a virgin would give birth in Isaiah 7:14, it seemed very unreasonable. At that time, most people must have watched to see if a virgin would really give birth. It wasn't until centuries later that Marygave birth to Jesus Christ. Whether the people believed Isaiah's prophecy or not, God's word came to pass. In the Bible, there were numerous prophecies that seemed impossible but have come to pass. If the Bible has been so accurate, it is wise to believe that it is absolutely right about the rapture.</p><p><br>When Noah announced to everyone that a flood was coming to destroy the whole earth, they laughed at him. He started building the ark, and they laughed even more. Years passed, and no flood came. Just before he went into the ark with his family, the people were still drinking and rejoicing like every other day, but a few days after, they had all drowned. Today, many people are living recklessly, ignoring the reality of the rapture. However, the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:52 that the rapture will happen suddenly. Only those who are prepared for it will be saved while the rest will be left on the earth to suffer.</p><p><br>One thing I know for sure is that the day the rapture happens, many people will be caught by surprise. There will be a lot of regrets from people who heard about the rapture, but who lived their lives without bothering to prepare for it by giving their lives to Jesus Christ and living holy. Unfortunately for them, it will be too late because the rapture will only happen once.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, are you ready for the rapture?</p>",

      "<p>These days, many people attempt to modernise Christianity. However, the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. God is never going to change; therefore, such people are only compromising on their faith.</p><p><br>It is okay to introduce technology into the work of God. It is also okay to use new approaches to share the gospel. However, the ancient landmarks must remain intact. The moment a fellow begins to explain away some of the basic principles of Christianity in the Bible, that fellow is already on the wrong path. For example, 2 Corinthians 6:14 says clearly that believers should not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. Some youths, in a bid to be modern, say that it is not bad to marry someone who is not a Christian. They claim that they are practising a less rigid Christianity than that of their parents. This can be potentially dangerous because someone who is an unbeliever will not understand the things of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 2:14) and will most likely oppose them or persecute the believer because of them.</p><p><br>Some people say that I am old school, and I agree, after all, I serve the Ancient of Days. However, I have been standing in the faith for over 40 years, while many 'modernChristians' are nowhere to be found. Without the 'old school' landmarks, you cannot remain strong in the faith. Some youths say that their parents are too rigid with theway they serve God. You may think some of the things that they do are not necessary, but believe me, they would not have achieved the results that they have today if they had not served God with such commitment. Denying one's self for the sake of the gospel shows a believer's level of commitment, and God rewards commitment (Hebrews 11:6).</p><p><br>If you are keeping the ancient landmarks, I want to encourage you to continue. Some people may laugh at you or call you a religious fanatic, but you must stand firm inyour commitment to God and not compromise on God's principles. In the past, I was also laughed at, but see how far God has brought me now.</p><p><br>Beloved, give yourself completely to God, and do not compromise on His standards; the whole world will soon come to the brightness of your rising in Christ.</p>",

However, great wisdom must be applied when using the gift of prophecy.</p><p><br>First of all, it is not everything that God tells you that you should tell others. There are certain things God tells you that are for your ears only. If you become so excited that you start telling them to people that He has not permitted you to share them with, you might cause more harm than good. God likes to share secrets with those that are close to Him. If He tells you a secret, you should ask Him if it is okay to share it with anyone. The moment He tells you a secret, and you tell someone that He has not permitted you to, He might stop speaking to you.</p><p><br>You must note that the gift of prophecy should not be used to show off that you are close to God. Prophecies must be handled with care because some people might not be able to receive, understand, and interpret what God is saying correctly.</p><p><br>When God tells you something about a particular fellow, you are not to say that thing in public except He specifically asks you to do so. If the fellow He spoke to you about is a public figure, find a way to send a message to him or her privately about what God told you. When God told Samuel that King Saul had offended Him, Samuel did not announce it to the entire kingdom. Our God is not a gossip. If He gives you information about someone, it is not for you to discuss it with the whole world. You must pay particular attention to this, especially when the prophecy is not a pleasant one. Even if such a fellow would have received your prophecy well, hearing it in public might make him or her defensive, and as such, the aim of that prophecy will be defeated. Also, God can change His mind about such a fellow if he or she begins to do the right thing as we see in Isaiah 38:1-5. If instead of telling the fellow privately, you announced the prophecy to the whole world, if God changes His mind, you will be left to defend what you had prophesied.</p><p>Beloved, be slow to speak (James 1:19).

      "<p>Today, I will be concluding the teaching I started yesterday on prophesying with wisdom. In our Bible reading for today, God sent Nathan to announce King David's punishment. As a wise prophet, Nathan knew that the way he communicated God's message would determine if he would leave the palace alive that day or not. Therefore, he started the message with a parable. When the king himself pronounced judgment based on his parable, he said, “That fellow is you, sir.” There is a powerful lesson for you to learn from here: when God sends a message through you to someone, you must be careful about the way you relay that message to the fellow.</p><p><br>If God tells you something about somebody, don't be in a hurry to tell the fellow. Ask God for wisdom to relay the message in the right way so that no one gets in trouble because of the prophecy. Over time, I have learnt to do this. This is why I often give prophecies in the form of parables. If God has told me something and I am to share itwith the public, if I know that the thing can be tough for some people to swallow, I will say it in the form of a parable. This way, I communicate God's message with wisdom.</p><p><br>I have also seen people who use the gift of prophecy to destroy families. If God tells you something about someone and He says you should tell the fellow, after asking God for wisdom on how to relay the message, you might also need to advise the fellow on how to use the information that he or she now has. This is because such a fellow might not have the same level of wisdom and understanding as you. If he or she lacks understanding or is not mature enough to handle the message appropriately, the devil can take advantage of this and push the fellow into taking actions that will cause more harm than good. If you know that the fellow may not use the prophecy correctly, and God is not compelling you to reveal the message, you may decide to just approach the person with general advice and guidance concerning that issue. This way, you can help him or her without causing any trouble.</p><p><br>Beloved, the gift of prophecy is to perfect the saints, not to confuse or endanger them (Ephesians 4:11-12); use it wisely!</p>",

The truth is that every human being was made from the dust of the ground and will eventually return there (Genesis 3:19). It is only the grace and favour of God that has brought us this far (1 Corinthians 15:10). If you think that you are successful because of how smart or brilliant you are, my question for you is, did you create your brain? Could you have single-handedly created the opportunities that you had while climbing the ladder of success?</p><p><br>The Bible tells us in Colossians 1:16-17 that all things exist in God and were created by Him and for Him. Everything we are and have is by God's provision and by His grace alone. This is why today's Bible reading tells us that no one can boast before God.</p><p><br>Even though I can be considered brilliant because I obtained a PhD in Mathematics, I could have ended up as a farmer in my small hometown, Ifewara, if God had not given me the kind of mother that I had. She supported my dream to go to school in every way she could, and if this had not happened, I would not be where I am today. This is why I cannot afford to be proud because I know my humble beginnings, and I did not get to where I am today solely by my efforts. God raised me by His grace and mercy, and He can also pull me down. In the Bible, even though King Saul was initially aware of his humble state before he was crowned king (1 Samuel 15:17), pride began to set in his heart as time went by. He got to a point where he began to feel like he needed more respect from people. Consequently, he lost his position and the kingdom was taken away from him (1 Samuel 15:22-31). By the time we get to 1 Samuel 16:1, God was telling Samuel not to waste his time praying for Saul because He had rejected him.</p><p><br>Beloved, do not allow pride into your heart. The moment a fellow becomes proud, destruction is waiting at the door (Proverbs 16:18). Never forget about God's abundantgrace, and be careful never to think that you are superior to other people. God is the One raising you and all the glory must be given to Him.</p>",

However, only God knows those who are truly worshipping Him and those who are just faking it.</p><p><br>In our Bible reading for today, we see one of the major indicators of fake worship. Saul was only worshipping God so that the elders, and all the people of Israel, could see that he was worshipping. If you only worship God in church for people to see you, then that is not true worship. When genuine worshippers worship God in public, it is an offshootof what they have been doing in private. They actually prefer to worship God in private so that they can freely express themselves, rather than in public, where they would be conscious of the people that are around them.</p><p><br>Another indicator of fake worship is when your worship consists only of clapping, singing, and dancing, without seeking to know and obey God. If you do not seek to do His will at all times, but only like to sing worship songs, you are only enjoying good music; you are not truly worshipping. Real worship is about pleasing God, not just singing, enjoying good music, and feeling good about yourself. True worshippers daily seek to know God and obey His commandments. They give their hearts completely to God and seek to glorify Him with everything in their lives. This is because, 1 Corinthians 10:31 says:<i><strong> “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”</strong></i></p><p><br>True worship comes from the heart; it is not a jamboree. True worshippers are so in love with God that they worship Him by serving Him and giving to His work in tithes and offerings. They also worship God by putting Him first in everything that they do. They are addicted to spending time in His presence and cannot imagine being separated from Him. Like David, a true worshipper would say:</p><p><br><i><strong>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</strong></i><strong> Psalm 42:1-2</strong></p><p><br>The essence of true worship lies in obedience and glorifying God in our lives, rather than offering sacrifices to Him with our mouths only.

      "<p>It is a terrible thing to miss the time of divine visitation. In Acts 3:1-11, the Bible tells us of a man who was born lame and who was always sitting at the gate of the temple. He could have decided to sit anywhere else in Jerusalem and beg for alms, but he chose to position himself where God would easily find him. He chose to sit at the gate of His temple, and the day of his divine visitation eventually came. You never can tell when the Almighty God will pay you a visit.</p><p><br>If you are a member of your church choir, there is usually a time that is allotted for rehearsals. If that is where God expects you to be at that particular time, He can decide to visit you there with your blessings. Some people left the place that God expected them to be, and by doing so, they were not available at the time He sent their miracle to them. When you are feeling tempted not to go where God expects you to go, or you feel like leaving where He expects you to be, whether it is a church service or a place of spiritual assignment, it means that the devil is trying to make you miss your blessing. May you not miss your day of visitation, in Jesus' name.</p><p><br>Apart from missing the time of divine visitation by not being in the right place at the right time, the devil also tries to get believers to be in the wrong places so that he can carry out his evil plans on them. There was a man who was killed when some robbers came to his house. The robbers had been watching him closely, and they knew that he was supposed to be in church at that time. However, on that particular day, he decided to stay at home rather than attend church service. When the robbers were caught, they confessed that they decided to rob the house because they thought that the man wouldbe in church. When they met him at home, they couldn't let him live because he saw their faces.</p><p><br>Beloved, be consistent in your walk with God and in your service to Him. Surrender all to Him and be diligent in doing what He has called you to do. He will surely visit you and reward you as you keep doing what He tells you to do (Ephesians 6:8).</p>",

      "<p>In our Bible reading for today, we see that when God hears the cry of one of His children and arises on behalf of that fellow, the whole earth will tremble, and the foundations of heaven will shake. This means that when God steps into a situation, His impact will be felt immediately.</p><p><br>Do you know that it is possible for you to get God to rise on your behalf? Psalm 144:5-6 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thinearrows, and destroy them.</strong></i></p><p><br>When the battle you are facing is becoming too great for you, and you need urgent divine intervention, you can specifically ask God to arise and come down to the earth for your sake, and He will do so. God sits in the heavens and controls everything that happens on the earth because the earth is His footstool. However, every now and then, when His children are facing some tough battles, He prefers to arise and come down by Himself to fight for them. Psalm 68:1-2 says:</p><p><br><i><strong>Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</strong></i></p><p><br>When you become overwhelmed, and all you need is for your enemies to be scattered, cry unto God and say, “Oh Lord, Arise!” He said in Psalm 50:15 that you should call on Him in the day of trouble, and He will answer you. I have discovered from the Scriptures and from personal experiences that whenever a genuine child of God is faced with overwhelming situations and circumstances, and he or she cries for God to arise and fight the battle, God always shows up.</p><p><br>In 2 Kings 19:14-19, King Hezekiah cried to the Lord when a mighty army decided to wage war against Judah. He knew that Judah did not stand any chance against the mighty Assyrian army; therefore, he reported the matter to God. God arose for Judah, and in that same night, the angel of the Lord went into the camp of the Assyrian army and killed 185,000soldiers. Hezekiah did not even need to raise an army to fightagainst the Assyrians; God took care of them Himself.</p><p><br>Beloved, do not despair when you are faced with seemingly impossible situations. Cry unto God, and He will surely arise to deliver you.</p>",

      "<p>In today's Bible reading, Abraham was walking towards Sodom with the three 'men' who had visited him. On their way, the Lord told him of His plan to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because of their numerous sins. I believe that God told Abraham His plan because He wanted him to intercede for the people in those cities.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Abraham interceded, and God accepted everything that he said. However, there were not enough righteous people in Sodom and Gomorrah, so they still ended up being destroyed. This shows that even when God calls for intercessors to pray against destruction in a particular nation or city, if He cannot find enough Christians there, the land may still be destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When Abraham was interceding for Sodom, his nephew, Lot, must have been on his mind. I am sure that he quickly did a little bit of Arithmetic and counted Lot, his wife, and his daughters. He also probably assumed that Lot's daughters had fiancés whose parents were also there. After his quick calculation, he must have come to the conclusion that there must have been at least ten children of God in the city. That must have been the reason he settled with God and said, “Lord, if you get to Sodom and find ten righteous people, will you spare the city because of them?” God accepted, but unfortunately, there weren't up to ten righteous people in the city. I pray that whenever God visits your hometown, He will find more than ten righteous people there, and His mercy will prevail over judgment.&nbsp;</p><p><br>This is why you should do something urgently about your hometown. You must make sure that the light of the gospel shines there so that even if some people commit evil acts that should ordinarily draw the wrath of God, He will consider His children and spare the land. Ensure that you regularly preach the gospel to the people of your hometown so that you can turn as many souls as possible to the path of righteousness. The Bible says that if you do this, you are wise, and great glory lies ahead of you (Daniel 12:3).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jesus specifically told His followers to start preaching the gospel from their hometowns when He said in Acts 1:8 that they shall be witnesses unto Him in Jerusalem first before progressing to Judea, Samaria, and the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, preach and teach the word of God to the people in your hometown. This is God's will, and as you obey, you and your hometown will be blessed tremendously.</p>",

      "<p>Power can simply be defined as the ability to do work. Sometimes, you can tell that a person is powerful based on his or her physical appearance. However, there is another kind of power that cannot be judged based on physical appearance alone. For example, in Judges 15:14-15, when Samson took the jawbone of an ass and killed a thousand Philistines, amongst other great acts he performed, the Philistines could tell that he had extraordinary strength. This was why they asked Delilah to find out the source of his extraordinary strength (Judges 16:4-5). What they didn't know was that the Holy Spirit always came upon him to give him the power to do the things that he did. Unfortunately, sin made him lose his power (Judges 16:20).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Not long after I got born again, I got a letter inviting me to my village for a programme. When I told my mother that I was going to honour the invitation, she became afraid because I had run away from the village after some people threatened to have me for breakfast. By this, they meant that they were going to kill me using diabolic powers. I told my mother that I was now born again and no weapon fashioned against me can prosper. She replied that I didn't look different at all, and asked how I was sure that I was now powerful. I told her that an electric wire that has electricity running through it and one that doesn't, both look alike. However, anyone who touches the one with electricity will know the difference. When you become born again, greater is He that is now in you than He that is in the world (1 John 4:4).&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are certain things that are needed to keep a fellow strong. Just like a bodybuilder is careful about eating healthy and exercising regularly, you also must be careful about what you let into your spirit. You must also constantly engage in spiritual exercise. When a Christian allows negative things into his or her spirit man, such a fellow will be contaminated. If you listen to worldly music, watch worldly movies, or view sensual pictures and videos on social media, you are reducing your spiritual strength.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, pray and fast regularly to maintain and increase the power of God within you. As you do these and live holy, the power of the Holy Ghost within you will grow, and God will be able to use you for greater exploits in His kingdom.</p>",

Our memory verse for today tells us that we were created for His pleasure. God sent you into this world to give Him pleasure. In fact, every part of your body was created specifically to give pleasure to God. Today, I will start teaching on the reason God made every part of the human body, and I will begin with the hands.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Psalm 47:1 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>One of the main reasons your hands were created is to clap for God. In Mark 3:1-5, Jesus Christ healed the man with the withered hand, even though the leaders of the synagogue didn't want Him to heal on the Sabbath day. God did not create the hands to be withered; the hands are meant to clap for Him. This was why, even though the man with the withered hand did not ask Jesus for healing, it was very important to Jesus that the man's hand be made whole.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are people whose hands do not look withered physically, however, when a fellow's hands cannot achieve as much as they used to, they can be considered to be withered. Also, when a fellow cannot spend as much as before, or when he or she cannot get certain things done as before, the fellow's hands can be said to be withered. When a person's hands are withered, he or she cannot be joyful, and when the person is not joyful, he or she will not be able to clap. I decree today, that if you have a withered hand, it will be restored, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If God has ensured that your hands do not become withered, then you will be ungrateful if you do not clap for Him in worship. If a fellow is ungrateful to God for His goodness and blessings, his or her hands are in danger of becoming withered. An ungrateful person is indirectly asking for his or her hands to be withered.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, I implore you to take a minute to think about all of the great and mighty things that God has done for you, and how great and powerful He is. Henceforth, always focus your thoughts on His goodness and clap for Him in thanksgiving and praise with all of your strength.</p>",

Psalm 150:4 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>God expects you to use your legs to dance for Him. In today's Bible reading, a man was born lame, and even though he always sat at the gate of the temple and could hear the praises from inside, he couldn't dance. On that fateful day, he asked the apostles for money, but God had arranged for his legs to finally be able to dance for Him. He didn't get the money he asked for, but Peter took him by the hand, and his ankle bones received strength. The Bible says that he entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.

No matter how great you become in life, you must always ensure that you use your legs to dance for the One who lifted you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many years ago, we were at a meeting of pastors. During the praise session, I closed my eyes to avoid distractions as I danced to the King of kings. One of the men of God needed to get my attention for something, but he couldn’t, because my eyes were shut. When he finally got me to open my eyes, he said, “Look at you, don't you know you are a General Overseer?” I ignored him because I was dancing to the One who made me a General Overseer, and I will keep dancing for Him until my last breath.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, ensure that you always show your gratitude to God by praising Him and dancing for Him.

In other words, He was telling the sea to roar His praises, the trees to clap for Him, and the birds to sing. Likewise, since you are on the earth, your voice must not be missing in this great choir. David said in Psalm 119:164:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>God created your mouth principally to sing His praise and to shout unto Him. You may not be able to sing as beautifully as the choristers in your church, but God knows that everybody can shout. That is why He said in Psalm 98:4 that you should make a joyful noise unto Him.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There is a story in Matthew 12:22 that illustrates how important the mouth is to God. A man was brought to Jesus Christ, and the Bible says that the man was blind and dumb. Jesus healed the man, and he began to speak and see. It is interesting to note the order in which the Bible recorded the miracle; the man was 'blind and dumb', but then the Bible recorded that he 'spoke and saw'. This shows that Jesus healed the man's mouth first before his eyes.&nbsp;<br>If you have not been shouting and singing to God before, start doing so henceforth. When you are in the bathroom, sing praises to Him. When you are walking along the road, let a chorus be in your mouth. When you are in church, and the minister on the pulpit asks you to shout Halleluyah, shout at the top of your voice. God loves it when you praise Him. When you shout and sing to Him, He is pleased with you and will draw near to you. The Bible says in Psalm 22:3:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>When you open your mouth to praise God at all times, He will draw near to you and abide with you continually. As a result, you will enjoy the numerous pleasures in His presence forevermore (Psalm 16:11) and experience His peace at all times, irrespective of what is going on around you.

However, a point came in his life when he fainted and would have died in battle if someone had not come to his rescue (2 Samuel 21:15-22).&nbsp;</p><p><br>The glory of the youth is in their strength; however, this strength must not be used selfishly. Rather, it must be used primarily to serve God. If you are a youth, you should not use your strength to engage in sexual immorality or pursue worldly pleasures. Rather, use your strength to work for God as this is the primary reason for making you strong. There are many people today who constantly regret how they spent their youth. Some of them do not have a stable marriage or a good source of income because of how they lived their lives when they were much younger. They sacrificed having a good future on the altar of 'having fun'.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are a youth, you need to be careful of the seeds you are sowing now because you will surely reap them in the future. Ecclesiastes 11:9-10 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>You should put evil far away from you, especially if you are a youth reading this.

      "<p>Today's memory verse says that money answers all&nbsp;things. Truly, when someone has money, that person has a level of power because he or she can pay to get so many things done, some of which would have probably been impossible without money.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I saw an inscription many years ago which said, “When money is speaking, nobody checks the grammar.” Nobody checks the grammar because most people are at the beck and call of a rich man. Even when he does something wrong, not many people are bold enough to correct him. Hence, money truly can give a person a level of power.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As powerful as money can be, however, Proverbs 23:5 says that it can grow wings and fly away. Also, even though money is powerful, there's a limit to what it can achieve. For example, it was recorded in the Bible that when there was a famine in Egypt, money failed (Genesis 47:15-16). In modern terms, this can mean that money no longer retains the value that it once had. For instance, in recent times, due to economic hardship, the currencies of many countries have lost so much value.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Since money can fail, it is not something you should rely on. There are many rich people who had the money for the best medical care in the world, but their money could not save their loved ones. There are people with state-of-the-art beds in their houses who can hardly sleep. Also, there are people with enough money to feed a city, who cannot eat what they want because of a health condition. You should not put your trust in money as whoever does so will be greatly disappointed. Proverbs 11:28 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>If a fellow has all the money in the world but does not have Jesus, he or she is finished. There is absolutely no profit in having all the money in the world and missing heaven (Mark 8:36). Only Jesus can be relied on; only He can stand by you to help you when everything else fails. Only He can give you and the generations after you a glorious future here on earth and in eternity.</p><p><br>Beloved, the money you have in your bank account, as much as it may be, can fail you. Do not put your trust in riches; rather, put your trust in Jesus. He loves you, and He will never fail you.</p>",

      "<p>Today's Bible reading says that two are better than one. This is because, if one person falls, the other can lift him up. For instance, if a fellow is walking alone at night and is suddenly attacked by some miscreants, that fellow would most likely find it more difficult to fend off the attackers than if he or she had company. It is indeed not good to be alone (Ecclesiastes 4:11).&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are battles you may never win if you fight alone, but if you have the right people on your side, you will stand a better chance of winning. There is an exponential increase in strength when a fellow is not alone. Deuteronomy 32:30 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>While it is good to have friends, it is important to choose the right ones. A popular saying goes thus: “Two heads are better than one.” However, that saying has been adjusted in recent times to be, “Two good heads are better than one.” Evil communication corrupts good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33). Who is your friend? Is your friend making you better or making you worse? If you have a friend who is corrupting your good manners, you should separate from such a fellow as he or she can cause you a lot of trouble. There are many people in prison today because of the kind of friend they had.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Make sure your friends are people with good heads on their shoulders. If you put a bad apple in a bowl with good ones, the bad apple will make the others rotten as well. If you have just one bad fellow in your group of friends, that one fellow will likely pull everyone down. It is better to stay away from such a person. Proverbs 13:20 says that the companion of fools shall be destroyed. Don't allow yourself to be destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you are unmarried, you must be extra careful when choosing a spouse. It is better not to be married at all than to get married to a bad spouse. Take your time to hear from God first. Get many confirmations that the fellow you want to get married to is not a fool. Do not think you can change him or her after marriage.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, your friendships and associations can greatly impact your life. Do not keep company with the wrong crowd.</p>",

Therefore, one can say that having wisdom is a very good thing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In 1 Corinthians 1:20, the Bible says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>From the Scripture above, we know that there is something called 'the wisdom of this world', and that God can turn this wisdom into foolishness. However, the question is, what is the wisdom of this world?&nbsp;</p><p><br>The wisdom of this world is any kind of wisdom that is not of God. In other words, any kind of wisdom that does not agree with the word of God is the wisdom of this world. It may seem good and also seem to yield temporary results, but if it is not of God, it will eventually become foolishness. In the same Scripture that was quoted above, the Bible tells us that when the wisdom of this world was turned into foolishness, the wise men of the world were nowhere to be found. They could no longer make a case for their kind of wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some people are boasting now, arguing that their kind of wisdom is the best because it appears to be yielding results for them, either in helping them to make money, or to get into positions of power and so on. However, because their wisdom is not based on the word of God, a time is coming when they will hide their faces in shame because it will be made foolishness.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, do not be moved by the methods and recommendations of men, even though they might seem very logical. If their recommendations are not based on what the word of God says, they are foolishness, and you should not partake of such. The Lord has superior wisdom for you, and He said that you only need to ask in order to get it (James 1:5). When you begin to use His wisdom, you may seem foolish at first to the people who are using the wisdom of the world, but I tell you from experience, sooner or later, you will have excellent results. Better still, your results will endure, and you will keep on excelling, long after the so-called results of the people who relied on the wisdom of the world have been forgotten.</p>",

      "<p>When people seek solutions to their problems outside God, they end up failing, even if it sometimes seems they were solved initially. The advantage we have as God's children is that we have a Father who never fails. The worst verdict any sick fellow can hear from a doctor is, “There is nothing more we can do.” However, when doctors reach their limit, the Almighty God can step into the situation and bring total healing because He is limitless.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Years ago, a woman told me that her daughter in the United States of America was pregnant and was about to deliver. The doctors discovered that the baby was too big to be delivered naturally, so they decided to perform a surgical procedure to bring the baby out. When they tested her blood, they discovered another issue – she was suffering from a very rare disease that would not allow her blood to clot. This meant that they also could not operate on her because she would bleed to death. God told me to ask the mother to bring two handkerchiefs for me to pray over. Even though I didn't understand why, I relayed the message to her, and she obeyed. After praying over the handkerchiefs, I told her to travel to meet her daughter in the hospital and lay one of the handkerchiefs on her. When she got to her daughter, she laid one handkerchief on her as I instructed. The following morning, the handkerchief was missing. They searched everywhere, and they just couldn't find it. The woman then said, “Thank God I brought two handkerchiefs.” She tied the second handkerchief firmly to her daughter's wrist and asked the doctors to wait to see what happens. The doctors said they could only wait until 10am, after which they will bring out the baby and take their chances with the mother. By 8am however, the baby that they said couldn’t come naturally was delivered safely.' If you cry out to Jesus when faced with an impossible situation, He will show up for you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>God said in Psalm 50:15 that you should call on Him in the day of trouble and He will answer. I want to advise that before that day of trouble comes, ensure that you are close to God so that He will listen to you when you call. Isaiah 59:1 says that He is not deaf, but sin can stop Him from hearing a person’s call. Live holy so that in the day of trouble, when you call on God, He will hear you.</p>",

If a person's strength is based on physical appearance alone, then David would not have defeated Goliath (1 Samuel 17:42- 54).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Ecclesiastes 7:19 says that a wise man is stronger than ten mighty men. In verse 12 of that same chapter, the Bible says:<i><strong> “For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.”</strong></i> This means that wisdom, money, or both, provides strength and security.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Everyone has something or someone that they depend on as their strength. However, the greatest of strengths comes from above. This is why David said in Psalm 121:1-2:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>David had a source of strength that helped him overcome battles, live in prosperity, and leave a good legacy. In the Scripture above, he said that his help came from the Lord. In other words, God was his strength. The strength that comes from the Lord is absolutely reliable because, not only is it supreme, it is always constant. That strength does not ever fade; it is everlasting. Hebrews 13:8 says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. If the Lord is your strength, your strength will be constant, even in old age. Deuteronomy 34:7 says that at 120 years old, Moses was still very strong; His eyes were not dim and his natural strength had not diminished. The strength that comes from the Lord is comprehensive. Philippians 4:13 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>'All things' in the above Scripture includes working miracles and laying hands on the sick for their recovery. Mark 16:17-18 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Beloved, do not be satisfied with your natural strength alone because it is very limited. Like David, look up to God for strength to overcome all of life's challenges and to do the impossible. Our God is faithful, and He can be relied on.</p>",

This is because God's word is final and the devil cannot change it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>How often do you study your Bible? Many believers only open their Bibles when they are in church and the pastor asks the congregation to read the Bible passage for the sermon. This is why there are many powerless Christians today. If you don't study the word of God, how will you know the God that you claim to be serving and the blessings that He has made available for you in Him?&nbsp;</p><p><br>The word of God must be like food to you. Jeremiah 15:16 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>When you esteem the word of God like the food that you depend on to survive, it will bring you so much joy because, all of a sudden, you will realise that you are called by the name of the Lord of Hosts. Names are door openers. If you are the son of a king, whenever you mention your father's name anywhere in the kingdom, you will be treated with respect and doors will be opened to you because you are called by the name of the king.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Our God is the King of kings and the Lord of Hosts. In other words, all kings, the hosts in heaven, on the earth, and underneath the earth are subject to Him. When you eat His word, you personify His name. This means that all kings, the hosts in heaven, on the earth, and underneath the earth will cooperate to do your will. Study the word of God and meditate on it every day. Beloved, this is how to walk in God's blessings for you and have good success (Joshua 1:8).</p>",

God loves you, and He will fight for you. Romans 8:31 says that if God be for us, who can be against us? This means that no one can overcome you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>One of the many things that God's love does for you is that it gives you victories for battles you are not even aware of. Many years ago, when I was a lecturer at the University of Ilorin, I was resting on the couch in the living room of my apartment while waiting to leave for the lecture hall. I closed my eyes because I didn't want to be disturbed, and all of a sudden, I felt hands holding my legs and hands. At first, I thought it was my wife because it felt like the fellow holding me was reaching forward as if to kiss me. However, I realised that whoever could hold my legs with one hand and my hands with the other must be really tall and strong. I opened my eyes to see a tall demon just before it disappeared. I felt a cold sensation throughout my body, but I shrugged it off because it was time to leave for my lecture. Immediately after the lecture, I started vomiting and stooling such that when I managed to drive back home, I had to practically crawl from my car into the apartment. I was in the toilet when I cried, “Daddy, what is this? How can this be happening to your son?” He then replied, “Son, I just wanted you to have a glimpse of the battles I fight for you that you are not aware of.” Afterwards, the stooling stopped.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, you are alive today because God loves you. Isaiah 54:15 says that those who gather against you shall fall for your sake. It will be childish for someone to think that everybody loves him or her. Sometimes, even the members of a fellow's household will hate him or her (Matthew 10:36). As a child of God, however, your confidence should be in knowing that God loves you and that when evil forces gather against you, He will always scatter them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, never be afraid of anything; you are more than a conqueror because of the love of Christ.</p>",

When God makes you a promise, He is going to fulfil it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It may take a while, but every promise you have received from God will come to pass because 2 Corinthians 1:20 says that His promises are 'yea and amen'. One of His promises is that you will always overcome evil attacks because Isaiah 54:17 says clearly that no weapon that is fashioned against you will prosper. This is the promise of the Almighty God, and it can never fail.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Deuteronomy 28:7 says that when enemies come against you, they will be smitten before your face. In other words, you are not the one who will do the fighting; you will just watch them being defeated before your face. When they come against you in one direction, they will scatter in seven different directions (Deuteronomy 28:7).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Another promise is in Deuteronomy 28:13:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>From the Scripture above, it is evident that you will always emerge at the top, no matter what happens to you.

For example, one of His titles is found in Exodus 15:26 where He said, “…I am the Lord that healeth thee.” This gives believers an assurance that no matter how terrible a sickness is, Jehovah Rapha can heal them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Medical doctors have different areas of specialisation, and it is standard practice for a doctor to refer patients to other doctors who are considered more knowledgeable and qualified to handle certain ailments. This was what happened to the woman with the issue of blood in Mark 5:25-34. Doctors kept referring her to other doctors until she had spent all that she had. One day, however, she came in contact with the Great Physician – the One who never refers a case – and that day, she got her healing.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Jesus Christ secured your healing when he was severely beaten and crucified (Isaiah 53:5). He took the stripes from the Roman soldiers so that you can confidently say that sickness and pain have no place in your body. He took your infirmities with Him to the grave; this means that they are gone forever.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Henceforth, I want you to know God as the God that heals you. When you read passages like Matthew 8:16 or Luke 6:19, you will see that Jesus Christ healed ALL that came to Him. There was no sickness that was difficult for Him to heal, and there was no person with too many sicknesses that He couldn't heal. If you have been dealing with any sickness or disease in your body, approach the Great Physician, He will surely heal you completely.&nbsp;</p><p><br>You must note, however, that healing is the bread of God's children (Mark 7:24-29). If you are not a child of God, or if you are professing to be a Christian but you are still living in sin, do not expect healing from Him. If God heals an unbeliever or a Christian who is not living holy, it is because He wants such a fellow to let go of the sins in his or her life. If the fellow does not repent and forsake his or her sins, it is very likely that a worse sickness will come upon the fellow. This was the warning that Jesus gave the man He healed at the pool of Bethesda in John 5:14.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, your healing has already been provided by Jesus. Surrender yourself completely to Him and walk in this divine right; He is the One that heals you.</p>",

Since the Bible tells us in today's memory verse that the truth shall make you free, it means that if you have Jesus, you are free from bondage. John 8:36 says, <strong>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”</strong> If you have the Son, it means that you can never be in any kind of bondage.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The devil destroys many people by putting them in bondage. Also, when he sees that he cannot stop believers from serving God, he will look for a loophole in their lives through which he can put them in bondage. A fellow's physical strength is useless if he or she is in bondage. This is why policemen arrest people in handcuffs. It is so that they cannot escape, even if they are stronger than the policemen.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There are quite a lot of people who have been chained by forces of darkness. If such people engage in a business that others are prospering in, for instance, they will become bankrupt. However, there is a God, whose name is the Truth, who is willing and able to set them free. I decree today, if you are experiencing bondage in any area of your life, the forces that have held you bound shall be scattered in different directions, in Jesus' name.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Many Christians are in the bondage of poverty because they don't know the truth about their wealthy heritage in Christ. The greatest bondage a fellow can experience is the bondage of the mind. There are so many blessings that are available to the children of God, but unfortunately, many Christians do not access them because they don't know the Truth. The Truth is the Word of God according to John 17:17. The more you study God's word with the help of the Holy Spirit, the more you will understand your divine rights in Christ and the blessings that He has made available to you. This will ensure that the devil cannot bring you under any form of bondage.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, if it seems like you are experiencing bondage in any area of your life, study what the word of God says about that aspect of your life. Listen to sermons and read books by genuine men of God about that particular area of life. As you study, the entrance of the word will bring light to you, and you will be liberated forever.</p>",

I had just become the General Overseer of the RCCG, and the church could barely pay me a salary, so things were quite tough at the time. While I was rejoicing, I remembered that I was now under a new management, so I turned to God and said, “Father, what do you want me to do with this money?” I thought He would ask me to pay my tithe, give an offering, and do whatever I wanted with the rest. However, He said that I should divide the money into three parts and give them to three different ministries. Then, He made a promise to me saying, “Son, I will be your source.” He has been my source ever since. Even when it looks like I am stranded, God always shows up with His timely provision. In Genesis 17:1, God reveals Himself as Jehovah El-Shaddai, the God who is more than enough.

The people in the next town where I was to minister were already gathering, and there were no commercial planes available at that time to fly into the town. Suddenly, the pilot of a jet that belonged to someone I know came around, and I asked him about his boss. When he heard about what had happened with my flight, he immediately told his boss, who asked him to take me to where I was going. God, the One who provides for me, already had an alternative plane waiting for me because He knew I would need it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, never worry about your needs.

Whether you decide to live holy or not, God will remain God.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Sin brings troubles, sorrow, chaos, and a low quality of life to sinners. It is a burden on the heart of a sinner. This is why lie detectors are able to detect lies because a person's heart goes through stress whenever he or she tells a lie. Many people do not live long because their heart is always stressed due to the atrocities they commit. It is wise to live holy; living holy brings peace of mind, wealth, favour with God, and long life. Most sinners think that they are very smart, however, living in sin is dangerous and can destroy them. I will rather be a fool for God so that I can live a peaceful life and enjoy all of His blessings.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some people say that living holy is hard because they are trying to live holy by their own efforts. When the Bible says that you should be holy as your Father in heaven is holy, it is only saying, “Be like God.” The elders in Yorubaland where I come from usually say that when a leaf stays attached to a soap, it becomes a soap itself. When you draw close to God, you will automatically become like Him. The way to live holy is to draw close to God. The more you behold His glory, the more you're transformed into His image (2 Corinthians 3:18).&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you have not yet given your life to Christ, you should do that immediately; this is the first step in living a holy life. If you are a Christian, you should study your Bible daily. David said in Psalm 119:11, <i><strong>“Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.” </strong></i>When you fill your heart with God's word, there will be no space for sin to dwell in. You also need to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). When you pray, you empower your spirit above your flesh, and the temptations to sin become less effective on you (Matthew 26:41).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, spend quality time with God by studying His word and praying daily. This will influence you to live in a way that is pleasing and acceptable to Him.</p>",

However, the devil did not succeed because God had said that Jesus Christ will bruise his head.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. </strong></i>Genesis 3:15&nbsp;</p><p><br>In John 14:30, Jesus Christ said:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>By living a life that was void of sin, He successfully conquered the world (John 16:33). Through His righteousness, we can now live righteously and above the world. The Bible says in 1 John 5:4-5:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</strong></i>&nbsp;</p><p><br>As Christians, all we have to do is to truly believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and we will receive the power to live above sin. Philippians 2:13 says that He will work in us to do His perfect will, thereby putting an end to the sinful nature in us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>When we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, we are celebrating our redemption from sin. We are celebrating not just His birth, but the event that made it possible for us to become born again such that we can now call ourselves children of God. The question now is, are you really born of God? The way to know if you are truly born of God is if you are living above sin. The Bible says in 1 John 3:9:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>Beloved, don't just wine and dine in this season; understand that the birth of Jesus Christ has given you the ability to live above sin and to be victorious in the world. Walk in faith every day and live in this reality.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue the teaching I started yesterday on the reason for the birth of Jesus Christ. The Bible makes us understand that God came down in human flesh to live amongst men (John 1:14), and the beauty of this is that He felt the same pains that we feel. There is a proverb that says, “It is he who wears the shoes that knows where it pinches.” Jesus Christ wore our shoes and so, He knows exactly how we feel at every point in time. Hebrews 4:15 says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>The best leader you can have is one who leads by example. Such leaders do not just give instructions, they also get down to do the work alongside their followers. Jesus Christ came into this world in the flesh to feel exactly what we feel. He went through the same temptations that we are going through now and showed us by example that we can live without sin. Having passed through the same things that we are passing through, He is a worthy advocate for us with the Father, such that if we fall into sin, He is there to plead with the Father on our behalf and help us get back on our feet (1 John 2:1). What great height of love this portrays! This is why in Revelation 5:1-10, He was the only one that was found worthy to open the scroll because of the sacrifices He has made to ensure that your name is written in the book of life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, don't walk the journey of your Christian faith alone. Lean on God at all times. When you are feeling tempted, remember that He has also gone through the same temptation. Approach the throne of grace boldly and tell Him that you need His help (Hebrews 4:16); He is not the kind of leader that will turn His back on you. He said that you should live holy because He has also been tempted before, and He overcame, therefore, He can also help you to overcome temptations. It is easier for a sailor to sail a ship through a storm if he or she is taking directions from another sailor that has sailed through such storms before.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Let Jesus teach you how to live above sin, and as He teaches you, make sure that you listen to Him and obey Him. You will surely be victorious.</p>",

      "<p>Over the last two days, I have been discussing the reason for the birth of Jesus Christ, and I will go a little further today. Before He was born, the Holy Spirit could only come upon certain individuals. However, after Jesus Christ came to the earth and ascended back into heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit to live inside every believer (John 14:16-17). This is why He said in Matthew 11:11 that the least in the kingdom of God is greater than John the Baptist who was the greatest of all the prophets before Him. Do you understand what that really means? It means that you are greater than Elijah, a man who called down fire from heaven at will. The birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ paved the way for God to put His very own Spirit in you. Now, you can be like Him in word and in deed. Isn't this awesome?&nbsp;</p><p><br>As a child of God, you carry God inside you, and this means that you are no longer an ordinary human being. You are now the temple of God.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? </strong></i>1 Corinthians 3:16&nbsp;</p><p><br>As the temple of God, it means that whatever cannot be found in God should not be found in you. Elisha may have died of sickness in his old age (2 Kings 13:14), but because you are carrying God inside you, sickness has no place in your body. Moses may have had anger issues, which eventually prevented him from entering the promised land, but you cannot be limited by such because God Himself is living inside you. You bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and no bad habit or weakness can find its place inside you. The Bible says in 1 John 4:4:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>You are an overcomer because the Sovereign God loves you and has made His abode inside you. Romans 8:37 also says:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>No matter what the devil throws at you, as long as the Holy Spirit is still residing in you, you will always be triumphant. Never give in to fear; remember that the Almighty God Himself is dwelling inside of you, and since He can never lose a war, you will experience victory in all areas of your life at all times.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will be concluding the study on the reason for the birth of Jesus Christ by looking at the impact of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. As I mentioned yesterday, Jesus paved the way for the Holy Spirit to live in believers, and the implication of this is found in John 7:38:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><br>In other words, the Scripture above is saying that everyone who is a believer has the Holy Spirit flowing in them, giving them the power to heal the sick, raise the dead, and perform all manners of miracles. This means that, if you are a believer, the signs and wonders that Jesus Christ performed will also follow you (Mark 16:17), and you will even do greater works (John 14:12).</p><p><br>When Jesus Christ died on the cross, the veil of the inner chamber in the temple was torn into two (Matthew 27:51). This means that the manifest presence of God was no longer the exclusive reserve of the high priest. Every child of God has access to the throne of grace and can do the same things that only the high priest could do in the Old Testament. Don't see ministers of God as the only people who can work miracles; you also can work miracles if the Holy Spirit is abiding within you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>John 3:34 tells us that Jesus Christ was given the Holy Spirit without measure as He represents God and speaks His word as He was sent. This implies that the expression of the measure of the Holy Spirit within believers will vary with how well they fulfil the will of God for their lives. If you live holy and make a habit of spending quality time in the presence of God daily, He will keep increasing the measure of the Holy Spirit's expression in your life with evidence of signs and wonders.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, circumstances around you should not dictate how you should live your life. You carry the Holy Spirit within you, therefore, you should command situations and circumstances to favour you. The devil is afraid of believers using the power they have in Christ. He can only oppress those who are not exercising the power they have in Christ.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, you have a unique advantage because of the power of the Holy Spirit that you carry inside you. Start exercising that power today, and you will see the devil tremble in fear.</p>",

Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.

A married woman has to submit to her husband, and that comes with restrictions, but if you ask her counterparts who are single, they will tell you that they prefer to be married. A jobless drunkard may laugh at someone who is rushing to work on a Monday morning and say that the fellow is not enjoying life. However, who is really suffering? The drunkard is the one under the bondage of alcohol. Unbelievers are locked in a prison, but they do not know it. Your prayer should be that the Almighty God should open their eyes as He opened yours and that they should come out of their prison and step into the freedom that Jesus has made available for them.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, do not ever be ashamed to talk about the restrictions that come with being redeemed.

Don't rely solely on what people say about you because they might not know you as well as you know yourself. They might not know the thoughts of your heart or what you do behind closed doors. Therefore, you need to look closely at yourself and perform an honest evaluation of the real state of your heart.</p><p><br>Don't judge yourself by your own standards; rather, judge yourself by God's standard. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10:18 that it is not the fellow who commends himself that is righteous, but the one that the Lord commends. Isaiah might have been judging himself by his own standards, but when he encountered God's glory, he saw that he was not in the state he was supposed to be. Judge yourself in the light of the truth in God's word; this will tell you whether you are on the right track or not. Do not judge yourself based on your feelings, what the society is saying, or on your achievements. Use God's word as a mirror, and let it show you the real you.

You cannot be righteous by your own power; you need God to help you. Psalm 20:1-2 says that you should pray that the Lord sends help to you from the sanctuary. Until you know that you need help, help won't come from the sanctuary. You must remain in front of the mirror of God's word until you receive help to become righteous. Do not be like the man that was described in James 1:22-24; continue steadfastly in God's word.&nbsp;</p><p><br>1 Corinthians 11:31 says that if you judge yourself properly, you will not be judged. This means that after examining yourself, identifying your faults, and making the right adjustments, you will not be condemned when the time of judgment comes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, I pray that as you make a habit of examining yourself using the standard of God, you will receive a commendation from the Master on the last day, in Jesus' name.</p>",

When The Redeemed Christian Church of God was just a small church with headquarters in a small corner of Ebute-metta, no one criticised us. Now that we have branches all around the world, criticisms come in from everywhere. This is a sign of growth, and rather than being sad about it, I am happy that we have grown.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Some people will criticize you out of love because your success means a lot to them.

No matter what people say about you, you must never give the impression that you are above correction. Moses was the anointed one who was called by God.

You may be the head of your home, Chief Executive Officer or pastor, but that does not mean you know it all.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Believe me, every criticism is an opportunity for you to become a better person. If you take it well, you will become better. The choice is yours. Some of the decisions we made that helped us become better were responses to criticism. I know some of the critics meant harm, but God used them to show us how to do things better, and we are growing stronger for it.</p>",

Many may even begin to feel that there are certain things that they should have done better. It is normal to have such feelings, as they can help a person to make better decisions in the future. However, it is unfruitful to dwell on the past. There is nothing to gain from living in regret about the past. Beloved, it is time to put the past behind you and begin to look forward to the glorious year that is ahead of you.&nbsp;</p><p><br>First of all, no matter what you have or do not have yet, you must always give thanks. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 says, <i><strong>“In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”</strong></i> Yes, the year has come to an end and you wish you had done better, but if you look closely, you will discover that you have many reasons to thank God. If you had died in the course of the year, you would not even be here to reflect on the past. There are so many things to thank God for. Show God that you are grateful because when God sees a grateful heart, He always visits that fellow with a blessing (1 Kings 3:3-15).&nbsp;</p><p><br>Secondly, note that God can make all things work together for your good (Romans 8:28). God can turn whatever you count as a loss into profit for you. When Joseph was thrown into prison in Genesis 39:20, it seemed like a bad experience for him; little did he know that the prison was his stepping stone to becoming the Prime Minister of the greatest nation in the world at that time. Don't ever write yourself off; always put God in the equation of your life. When you do this, you will experience a complete turnaround and His tremendous blessings will follow.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If, however, you have been living in sin, do not expect God to help you turn things around. He said in Isaiah 3:11, “Say unto the wicked that it shall be ill with him.” This means that it shall not be well with anyone that is living in sin. On the other hand, the Bible says in Isaiah 3:10, “Say unto the righteous, it shall be well with him.”&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved, if you want to experience God's blessings in the year ahead of you, make up your mind to live according to His will daily.</p>",

      "Every New Year typically comes with renewed hope, encouraging many people to set new goals. Yes, it is important to set goals; however, it is more important to ensure that they align with God's will for your life. <br><br>Let us consider God’s recommendation for setting goals as captured in Habakkuk 2:1, which says:<br><br><b>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me…</b><br><br>Have you asked the Lord about His plans for you this year? Have you waited on Him to know what exactly He will have you pursue this year? If you haven’t, please spend some time seeking His face for divine direction. <br><br>Speed is not always synonymous with progress. If you are speeding away in the wrong direction, you will discover that you have gone backwards rather than forward at the end of the day. Only God, who created you for His purpose knows the direction you should be going per time, so always ask him for guidance. Remember, a way that seems right may have death at its end (Proverbs 14:12). <br><br>There was a time when we were organising crusades across various cities in Nigeria. When we were scheduled to move to the southern part of the country, I asked God for His will and He told us to go to Ede instead, a town in the western part of the country. I responded that we had just been to Ife (a town just a few kilometres away from Ede) but I still went ahead to obey Him. <br><br>At the crusade, the king of Ede, a Muslim,  promised to gift us whatever size of land we desired. As we were about to mention a size we considered huge enough, the Lord directed us to ask for a whole lot more. Humanly speaking, it didn't make sense to make such a request, but we obeyed God, and the king granted our request. Today, the Redeemer's University and the School of Missions are situated on that land.<br><br>Let God be the One to show you the goals to pursue this year. If it is His vision, you are assured of His provision and support until you achieve it.",

      "After you have received your vision for the year from God, the next step is to write it (Habakkuk 2:2). Many times, the reason we don’t achieve what we set out to, is simply that we never wrote it down. God’s recommendation for running with a vision is to, first and foremost, write it down. Have you received an idea or instruction from the Lord? Go ahead and write it down now. In the course of doing this, you are bringing it to life; you are taking it from the spirit realm to the physical. Writing it is your first step towards achieving it. You are to write it down along with what you will do to achieve it. <br><br>The next step will be to <i>“make it plain upon tables”</i>. In making it plain, you can break it into objectives or smaller goals, and as you accomplish each of them, you’ll get closer to achieving the entire vision. Note that Habakkuk 2:2 says ‘tables’ and not ‘table’. You are therefore to paste it everywhere around you where you will keep seeing it over and over again. When you do that, you and those the Lord has prepared to support you can begin to run with it.<br><br>Now, beyond writing down what to do to achieve the vision, you must also take note of the things not to do to ensure that your vision is fulfilled. Matthew 9:17 says:<br><br><b>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</b><br><br>You cannot achieve new things with old habits. There are some friends who pulled you back last year; you need to dissociate yourself from them this year. Check your morning routines last year; did they help you get the best out of your days? If not, then you need to change them. How was your relationship with God last year? If it was shaky, then you must be determined to draw closer to Him this year than ever before.  Remember, if the Lord does not build a house, those who try to build it are merely wasting their time (Psalm 127:1).",

      "The first thing you need to know about our topic for today is that God does not breathe to survive like we humans do. Someone who cannot die definitely does not need to breathe to stay alive. Thus, when we say that God breathes, it means that something rare and special is about to happen. Genesis 2:7 says:<br><br><b>And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</b><br><br>The Almighty God, who does not need to breathe to remain alive, decided to breathe because He wanted to give life to a non-living thing. He breathed on ordinary clay, and it became a living soul. When He breathes on the dead, they come to life. That is how powerful the breath of God is, and believe me honestly, as humans, one thing or the other will seem to be dead in our lives at one point or the other, so we all need God to breathe on us.<br><br>Romans 4:19 says not only was Sarah’s womb dead, her husband’s body was dead too, but the One who can breathe life into the dead brought it back to life. He does not only breathe on dead wombs; He can also breathe on dead businesses, careers, marriages, ministries and many more. <br><br>You may have noticed an area of your life where there has been no progress for years; you would need God to breathe on it and bring it to life. Genesis 49:22 says <i>“Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall”</i>. Joseph prospered everywhere he went – even as a slave (Genesis 39:2), a prisoner (Genesis 39:21-23) and then as a prime minister (Genesis 41:41). <br><br>The first verse of today’s Bible reading shows the secret of Joseph’s fruitfulness – he feared the Lord and walked in His ways. You have to stop committing sin and walk in the ways of the Lord, then you would find out that what had seemed dead before would begin to bear fruit. I pray that God will give you the grace to fear Him and to always do His will, in Jesus’ name.",

      "When God decides to breathe for the sake of someone, He may not do so directly on the individual; rather, He could breathe heavily to blow away the fellow’s enemies. Whenever you see the Bible say ‘blast of His nostrils’, that is God breathing heavily to blow away the enemies of His children, as we see in Exodus 15:8-10. <br><br>With the blast of His nostrils, He parted the Red Sea that was standing in the way of the Israelites to the Promised Land and then He made the water return, to drown Pharaoh and his army. When God breathes against your enemies, not only will they be no more, you will also be established in the place of your destiny. David testified to this in verse 20 of today’s Bible reading:<br><br><b>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</b><br><br>With one breath, the Lord cleared off all David’s enemies and also brought him into a large place. Do you know that God can do the same for you today? He can clear off all your enemies and take you to that same place that they have been trying to stop you from getting to.<br><br>Now, I have always said that the summary of all Jesus’ messages in the Bible is that nothing goes for nothing. In other words, there are always conditions to be met for everything that we expect God to do for us. What is the condition for God to breathe against our enemies and to lead us to the glorious end He has set ahead of us?  It is in verses 21-25 of our Bible reading – holiness. David said the Lord rewarded him according to his righteousness and the cleanliness of his hands. <br><br>Are your hands clean? When a person is faced with enemy forces he or she cannot defeat; an ally stronger than the enemy forces would be required to guarantee victory. The ally would however, withdraw their support if the person offends them. Don’t offend your Ally. Don’t do things that will make the Lord refuse to fight for you. ",

      "Our memory verse for today says that the workman that will not be ashamed is he or she who rightly divides the word of truth - not just one who reads it, but one who divides it and learns from it. Many people read their Bibles but do not really learn from it. It has become something done just to fulfil all righteousness. There are many great treasures of knowledge in the Bible that will benefit anyone willing to search them out. <br><br>When you study the Bible, you should be on the lookout for new things you can learn and apply in your marriage, business, career, ministry or any other aspect of life. Proverbs 18:15 says:<br><br><b>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</b><br><br>The Bible is not a story book; it is a life manual, and lessons from it must be applied in our lives. Romans 15:4 says <i>“For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.”</i><br><br>2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us that the Scripture is given to us so that we can be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto ALL, not some, but ALL good works:<br><br><b>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</b><br><br>Living according to the standards of God as shown in the Bible may appear difficult, it is however, better that you discipline yourself to do so because the results would be great in your life. For example, the word of God says you must be humble, so be humble. As a result of your humility, God will give you grace to succeed (James 4:6). His word says you should be diligent, so be diligent and as a result, you will stand before kings (Proverbs 22:29). Believe me honestly, I have found that God’s word is the key to true success in life. Be dedicated to studying it and applying your learnings correctly from today.",

      "God is love and perfect love can only be experienced in Him (1 John 4:16-17). No matter how strong human love is, it usually has a hidden agenda and will remain imperfect if it is not established in God.  <br><br>There is a classic example of two people who loved each other in the Bible: David and Jonathan. In 1 Samuel 18:4, the Bible says:<br><br><b>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</b> <br><br>Looking closely at the gifts, you would observe that Jonathan gave David practically everything except his shoes. This is because in Bible  times,  one way to seal a contract is the giving of shoes, without which everything given can be reclaimed (Ruth 4:7). In those days also, only sons wore shoes; servants were not allowed to. That is why in Luke 15:11-24, when the prodigal son returned, the father asked that shoes be put on his feet to show that he had accepted him back as a son and not a servant. Thus, we see that Jonathan was saying to David, in essence, “We are friends, but don’t forget who you are. You are a beloved servant, but I am the son. You are only a beloved servant”. In 1 Samuel 20:13-16 and verse 42, we see that Jonathan entered a covenant with David when it became clear that the latter would be king, extracting a promise from him not to wipe out his family.  Later on, he even asked to become David’s assistant (1 Samuel 23:17). Be careful when people say they love you; it may be because of what they can get from you. If it so happens that there is nothing to get anymore, then you would know who truly loves you. <br><br>God’s love for us, however, is perfect and unconditional. He loved us even while we were yet sinners (Romans 5:8). He sacrificed His only begotten son so you and I can be saved (John 3:16). He alone is worthy of all your trust (1 John 4:16). Choose the perfect love of God today by surrendering your life to Jesus. It is only in Him that we have an assurance of boldness on the day of judgement (1 John 4:17) and eternal life (Romans 6:23).",

      "Many have heard the term ‘Joy Unspeakable’, but only a few have ever experienced it. That is the kind of joy that overwhelms you so much that even when you want to express it verbally, you would find yourself speechless. Some years ago, we had a programme in a town called Ota in Ogun State, Nigeria. A lady who had been barren for several years came there that day asking for prayers, after her husband’s relatives had threatened to throw her out within the year. There were many people so I didn’t even know who I prayed for. The following year, we were holding another programme somewhere else, with a long queue of those who wanted me to pray for them. Unknown to me, this same lady was there and when it got to her turn, she kept opening her mouth to speak but said nothing. Finally, she was able to utter just one word: “Jesus”.  When she finally was able to speak, she explained that she was that barren woman I had prayed for the previous year. It was then I realized why she had been speechless earlier; she was carrying a baby on her left and another on her right - she had given birth to twins. I pray you will soon experience joy unspeakable, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Our memory verse (1 Peter 1:8) says if you believe in God, then He will make available to you joy unspeakable, full of glory. All you have to do is believe in Him. Believing in Him means that you act according to what you say you believe. James 2:17 says: <br><br><b>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</b><br><br>Your behaviour must show that you believe in God. Your attitude must reflect your belief in all the promises of God in the Bible. It must be that of one who goes to God believing that whatever he has asked for will be given to him. James 1:6-8 says anyone who comes to God without faith should not even think that he will receive anything from Him.Put all your faith in God and you will experience unspeakable joy as He begins to unfold His glorious plans for you in Jesus’ name.

      "Love is a two-way street (Proverbs 8:17). You show someone love, and typically, they will show you love in return. If you want to make friends with people, show yourself friendly to them first (Proverbs 18:24). If you want them to favour you, favour them first. I have seen people arrive at my house frowning but depart with beaming smiles after experiencing my wife's hospitality. Indeed, some people don’t have friends because they don’t show themselves friendly.<br><br>Several years ago, one of my daughters came to me and said, “Daddy, I’m this old, and nobody has approached me to say, ‘Thus saith the Lord…’”. I said, “With the way you glare at everybody as if you are spoiling for a fight, who is going to approach you and say, ‘Thus saith the Lord” even if God is actually speaking? You never smile; you are always looking as if somebody offended you, and so, if a brother should even be coming your way, one look at your face is enough to make him change his mind.” Thank God she took the feedback graciously and made the necessary changes. It wasn’t long after that she got married. Love should be reciprocal. <br><br>Whether you believe it or not, everyone needs good friends. Our Bible reading for today says for the one who has no friend, WHEN he falls, there would be no one to lift him. Take note that the word ‘when’ was used, not ‘if’. Everyone will have times when they need someone to lift them; God forbid that there is no one to lift you when that time comes. Proverbs 18:24 says that there are some friends that stick closer than a brother. You need friends, so show yourself friendly to those around you.<br><br>You must, however, choose your friends carefully because, as iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17), so does evil communication (bad company) corrupt good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33).  Everyone needs good friends, and the greatest friend of all is our Lord Jesus Christ. Surrender your life to Him today if you haven’t, so you can also become His friend (John 15:15).",

      "There is a popular wise saying that in the time of peace, prepare for war. Similarly, before you have a need, sow seeds ahead, so that when a storm arises, your seeds will speak for you. Sow seeds of service to God now because a time is coming when you will be so old, you will not have the strength to run around doing God’s work. Even if you don’t face any storm at all in your lifetime, a time is coming when you will face the storm of death. At that time, God will ask you, what did you use the talents I gave you for?<br><br>Sow good seeds now because when a storm comes, you would need them to speak for you. When you read the story of the sinful woman in Luke 7:37-38, you would see that she sowed a seed that day by washing Jesus’ feet with her tears and wiping them with her hair. She also poured a very costly ointment on Him and Jesus took note of her. May you do something today that will cause God to take note of you. <br><br>During a meeting with my covenant partners some years ago, I told them to ask God for just one thing. There was a woman amongst them who had been barren for many years and what she asked God for was a baby. She got pregnant and went to the U.S. for tests, but the doctors said that there were high chances of the baby being HIV positive and would have to be evacuated. She refused and cried to the Lord, asking for a sign that would convince her that He had heard her prayer. He responded, “Go home; before you get there, you will get a sign”. It was during her return to Nigeria that we ran into each other on the plane. She started screaming and when I asked her what the issue was, she explained to me. I prayed with her and a few months later, she delivered the baby safe and sound. The baby was HIV negative and even her husband who had been HIV positive also became negative. Her seed spoke for her. <br><br>May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble and remember all your offerings in Jesus’ name. ",

      "In our Bible reading for today, we see how Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah rejected the king’s food so as not to defile themselves. Though they were slaves in a strange land, these boys were determined to maintain their consecration to God. <br><br>Unfortunately, there are many Christians who begin to behave like the people of the world the moment they get to a land where nobody knows them. We see several examples of such in the Bible. Let us consider Lot. He was Abraham’s nephew and must have been trained according to the instructions of God, but when the angels got to Sodom and Gomorrah, who did they find at the gate of the city? Lot. He had blended so much with them that he was amongst those who sat at the gate of the city (Genesis 19:1). He ended up losing all that he had amassed, including his wife.<br><br>Wherever you find yourself, you must live by the standard of the Most High God. Some Christian students resume in the University and dump all the consecration they maintained while at home. They start mixing with ungodly friends and join them to lead sinful lives. Some others travel to a different country or state and begin to misbehave. <br><br>Be warned! When Daniel got to a strange land, he ensured he kept company with fellow believers. When you get to a strange land, locate other believers - people who are on fire for God - and befriend them. Join a Bible-believing church where you can continue to serve God as you used to back at home. When you refuse the king’s meat and wine in that strange land so as to stay pure, God will defend you at all times. <br><br>When Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (now renamed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego by their captors) were thrown into the fiery furnace, the fire could not burn them because they took a stand for God (Daniel 3). When Daniel was thrown into the lions’ den, the lions could not eat him because he had not defiled himself by indulging in the sinful lifestyle of the inhabitants of the land (Daniel 6). Stand out for Christ anywhere you find yourself and Christ will stand up for you too.",

We can infer a theorem from this – that when God loves you, He will give you His life. In mathematics, whenever we establish a theorem, there always has to be the corollary – something that follows as a result of what we just established. The corollary to our newly established theorem is in Proverbs 8:36:<br><br><b>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</b><br><br>Herod was a man who hated God; he did everything he could to hinder the work of the Lord and he died a shameful death. After his death, the Bible says, <i>“But the word of God grew and multiplied”</i> (Acts 12:24). Anyone who tries to stand in the way of the Most High God hates Him and is calling for death. <br><br>Some time ago, in another country, we wanted to dedicate a new parish, but in the process of trying to get the necessary approvals, a government official swore to prevent it. My children called me to report the incident and, believe me honestly, I didn’t even bother to pray about it. On the day of the meeting at which this government official was planning to have our application rejected, he put both feet into one trouser leg. While struggling with the trouser, he fell, hurt himself and was rushed to the hospital. He died with both legs still in one side of the trouser. <br><br>You may claim not to oppose the work of God as directly as that. Do you discourage other people from submitting to the authority of your Pastor and the Heads of Departments? Do you steal money from the Church’s purse, thereby making it more difficult for God’s work to be done? You are hindering the work of God and anyone who does so is toying with death. A word is enough for the wise. ",

    bodyText:
      "More often than not, the people who provoke God do so through pride. The most junior staff in an organisation would typically be humble and submissive. However, the day the person begins to feel overly important, he or she will start provoking some people. The moment you become proud, you begin to provoke God. Never forget that no matter how high you go, God is still the Most High. <br><br>God usually deals with proud people in two ways. The first way is by recalling such a person suddenly and in a disgraceful manner. In Acts 12:20-24, king Herod’s pride made him consent to being compared to the Most High. This made God order worms to eat him up alive. The Lord said, “Oh, you think you are big because you are the Commander-in-Chief of some armies? I have armies that don’t carry guns - ordinary worms”. One moment Herod was sitting on the throne, the next moment, he was being eaten by worms. However, the Lord could also decide to disgrace the fellow openly while preserving his or her life. That is what He did to Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4:28-37. <br><br>Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest king of his time. He built a city called Babylon, which had one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. At a point, God saw that he was becoming proud and sent him a warning through a dream. Unfortunately, one year after the message came, he had forgotten it, so God said, “Okay, you think you are big? Go and eat with animals for seven years”. Nobody removed his royal robes from him; he removed them with his own hands. If there is something that must leave your life permanently today, it is pride.<br><br>Be careful as you rise, so as not to begin to feel like you are overly important. The elders say that when the cockroach falls, nobody hears the sound; when an ant falls, the ground doesn’t tremble, but if an elephant falls, the tremors would be felt both near and far. If God is elevating you, be weary of pride so that it doesn’t become a case of Him raising up an elephant so that when it falls everyone would pay attention, like in the case of Pharaoh (Romans 9:17).",

There are people who pray, study the Bible and are even more talented than you, but God chose you; you should be grateful for that. In any case, if we were to count iniquity, who will stand? (Psalm 130:3). When people see the things God is doing in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, they think I must be special. The only thing special about me is that God chose me, because even from as far back as when I was a little child, God had promised my Father-in-the Lord that The Redeemed Christian Church of God would go round the world. It had nothing to do with me at all; God just decided to glorify Himself through this Church and it is only by grace that He chose me to be the General Overseer. He could have chosen anyone else. There are people far more qualified than I, but it is by grace that I was chosen.<br><br>When you see people still drowning in sin, don’t judge them because you are on your way to heaven; rather, pray that God will save them by His grace. It is by His grace that you are not the one on the way to hell. Never forget that it is He who is working something out for His name’s sake. You are only graced to be a recipient of God’s blessings. The people of Israel may have thought that God parted the Red Sea and drowned Pharaoh and his army because they were so special. He did it for His name’s sake. They were only graced to be the ones He did it for.

      "Abraham was a man who raised many altars for God (Genesis 12:7, Genesis 13:4, Genesis 13:18, Genesis 22:9). Little wonder why he had transgenerational blessings. An altar is a meeting place between God and man. In our Bible reading for today, we see how, even when Jacob was unaware that he was at an altar, he saw in a dream that the place was a meeting point between heaven and earth. For example, an altar can be a corner of your room if you are living in a one-room apartment. You could set aside a corner in your room with a commitment to meet with God there regularly. You must treat the place as holy; because that is the altar of the Almighty God. The moment you set aside that place as an altar to God, any time you go there, God would be waiting.<br><br>When man goes to an altar, he does so to offer sacrifices to God and to worship Him. In Genesis 22:1-14 when God asked Abraham to offer Isaac as a burnt offering, He asked him to go to a particular place, raise an altar there and present a sacrifice. When visiting a great man, because of how much you honour him, you don’t go empty-handed, so why do so when going to meet with the Most High God? Don’t go to God empty handed. If you don’t have anything at all, He will accept a sacrifice of praise (Jeremiah 17:26).<br><br>When God comes to meet man on the altar, He comes to bless. Psalm 67:5-7 tells us that when praises go up, blessings come down. In Genesis 22:15-18, when Abraham brought Isaac to the altar to be offered, God stopped him and said, “You have done your part, let me do mine, in blessing I will bless you, in multiplying, I will multiply your seed”. God meets with His children during services to bless them, especially those who come with a sacrifice. I raised an altar in a small room inside the first house I lived in the Redemption Camp well over 20 years ago. The house is now called the ‘Open Heavens International Centre’. Since that place was marked out as an altar, up to today, people who go there to pray in faith receive mighty miracles from God that even I find amazing.",

      "The sacrifice that pleases God the most is your life. You become a living sacrifice the day you surrender your life to Jesus. From the day you genuinely surrender your life to Him, He can send you wherever He wants, set the direction of your life and use you to fulfil His plans. God knows, I never wanted to be a Pastor, talk less of a General Overseer, but I am a living sacrifice. I had wanted to retire at the age of seventy, so that I could then begin to live a normal life – sleep when others sleep, eat when others eat and so on, but God said, “No”. Since I am a living sacrifice, my response was, “Yes, Daddy”. <br>God expects your entire life to be a sacrifice to Him; you are to go wherever He sends you. When He says witness - you witness, sit - you sit, pray - you pray. <br>The moment God knows that He has you as a living sacrifice, whatever other offering you give becomes acceptable because it would be given under His guidance. Some of us, even before coming to Church, have made up our minds on the offering to give. For the fellow who is a living sacrifice, God will tell them what to give. <br>When I became General Overseer, things were hard. We could hardly pay the staff on the church's payroll and many a time there would be nothing left to pay the General Overseer. Having left paid employment for full-time ministry after working for the government for several years, I received my gratuity, with plans to save some, invest some in shares and so on. However, since I am a living sacrifice, I asked God, “What do I do with this money?” He responded that I should divide it into three parts and give each to a different ministry while retaining nothing for myself. As painful as this was, I was comforted when He said further, “I will be your source”. When you become a living sacrifice, God will become your source. The day you became a living sacrifice, you became His property, so He will take care of you.

      "In our Bible text for today, we read about the widow of Zarephath who had only one meal left. She and her son were going to eat and die. She sacrificed that one meal and she and her son lived on. In Psalm 50:14-15, the Bible says if you offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and pay your vows, God will deliver you in the day of trouble. <br><br>In 2 Samuel 24:11-25, seventy thousand men had died from a pestilence that arose in Israel due to David conducting a census that displeased God. This was a big disaster and something had to be done immediately to stop it. They had prayed and, although God had stopped the angel that was spreading the plague, He did not recall him; the angel remained at the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite. This still meant trouble, so David’s seer - Gad decided that they should apply a principle to avert the disaster.<br><br><b>And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</b><br>2 Samuel 24:18 <br><br>When David wanted to make the sacrifice, Araunah tried to give everything needed to him for free, but he refused. He insisted that he had to bear the cost. He gave the sacrifice and the disaster was immediately averted.<br><br><b>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</b><br>2 Samuel 24:25 <br><br>The funny thing is that many non-Christians know this principle: that, in the face of impending doom or disaster, a really big sacrificial offering can avert it (2 Kings 3:26-27). We as the children of the living God should follow David’s example and be ready to give a sacrificial offering, especially in troubled times.<br><br>May God help us - the true children of God to apply this principle in order to avert looming disasters, in Jesus’ name.",

      "<b>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</b><br>1 Samuel 15:11 <br><br>The first time I read the passage above, it was shocking to me that God would repent. I had  read passages in the Bible like Ezekiel 33:14-16 where God said if He says to the wicked that he will die, but the wicked changes his ways, then He wouldn’t let him die anymore. However, what is mind-boggling about Saul’s case is that this is a different kind of repentance. Of a truth, Saul was a very humble, diligent and responsible young man before he became king. In 1 Samuel 9:3-4, his father sent him on an errand to search for some missing animals. Saul kept searching and was determined not to return home until he found them. God is the Alpha and Omega (Revelation 1:8), He knows the end from the beginning (Acts 15:18); how can somebody like that repent of the decision He had made? One day, the Lord used the scripture below to provide an answer to my question: <br><br><b>Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come</b> <br><br>1 Corinthians 10:11 <br><br>All the stories we read in the Bible, even some of the things happening around us today, are supposed to be lessons to us. One could therefore say that He looks for scapegoats to use to teach others a lesson. <br><br>Now, there are two questions you should ask yourself from this revelation: first, are you really learning lessons from the examples that God has given you in the Bible and around you? Have you learnt from Judas Iscariot’s case that greed can destroy a person both here and in eternity? Have you learned from Samson that sexual sins will reduce a strong man to a piece of bread (Proverbs 6:26)? Have you learnt from the examples around you?",

      "Following our discussion which started yesterday, the second question that you should ask yourself is, “What kind of example am I going to be for those coming behind me?” You see, God can raise somebody and promote him or her greatly, but when the fellow makes a mistake and crashes, he or she becomes an example for others to learn from, so as not to make the same mistake. If you read 1 Corinthians 10:1-11 carefully, you would see that verses 1-4 were dedicated to describing the investments that God had made in the people of Israel, then the rest of the passage goes on to list how many of them became bad examples for those of us coming after. God is making investments in you now, He is making sure that you read and hear certain messages, He is promoting you and doing miracles for you now; what will be the outcome of all these? Will you be used as a good example later in future or a bad one? <br><br><b>But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</b><br>1 Corinthians 10:5 <br><br>The verse above says God was not pleased with many of them.

The devil will throw a lot of temptations your way. Some of them will come as harmless suggestions, but you have to be fully ready to submit to the Lord and resist the devil so that he would flee (James 4:7).<br><br>As we see in our Bible reading of today, purge yourself of all unrighteousness so you can set the right examples for those coming behind you.

      "This teaching series on 'flames of fire' is meant for everyone; however, I'll encourage youths to pay extra attention. <br><br>There are four basic elements in the world - water, earth, air and fire, each of which is very important to human existence. As important as all these elements are however, it is interesting that God chose to make His ministers flames of fire. <br><br>Let us discuss some characteristics of fire. The first thing about fire is that it is distinct. When you see fire, you recognise it immediately. In 2 Kings 1:1-8, the king was sick and sent his servants to enquire from some idol worshippers whether he would recover or not, only for them to meet a man on the way who sent them back to the king with a message that he would die. Once the messengers described the man, the king said, “That is Elijah”. Fire is uniquely distinct and you cannot mistake it for anything else. <br><br>People should be able to see a child of God and say, “This is a child of God”. These days, many people say, “Oh, it’s not about the outward appearance;  God is only interested in what is on the inside”. One day while teaching at the Bible College, I brought two oranges – one green and one yellow, and asked the students to identify the ripe one. They all pointed to the yellow one, explaining that, from the way it looked, it was clear that it was the ripe one.<br><br>Fire has a distinct look; when you see it, you would know it. Don’t believe the lie that God is not interested in your outward appearance - He is. While it is true that He cannot be deceived by your outward appearance as He said in 1 Samuel 16:7, His word says that what you are on the inside will show on the outside. Matthew 23:26 says,<br><br><b>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</b> <br><br>You cannot claim, as a minister, that you are a flame of fire when you don’t look it. You cannot claim that you are a child of God, yet dress and look like people of the world. If you need to tell people that you are a child of God before they believe it, you are not yet a flame of fire.",

Fire is fire. It is not frozen today, liquid tomorrow and vapour the next day; fire is always fire and remains in one state. It does not copy anything or anyone else – it remains in its own state.<br><br>I remember a time when the custom amongst men of God in Nigeria was to wear a flowing robe - <i>agbada.</i> It was their way of proclaiming, “We have arrived”. I don’t have anything against the <i>agbada</i>. It is the traditional attire in many Nigerian cultures and I do wear it now and again. However, I refused to follow the trend of wearing it all the time. One man of God said to me then, “I like you, but I don’t like the way you dress like a hunter” – apparently referring to the conservative French suits I often wear. I told him I was not a hunter, but rather, a soldier of Christ. Fire does not blend in with its environment; rather, it affects it.<br><br>You must stand apart. You cannot afford to do something simply because others are doing it. Fire does not conform; it is not afraid to stand alone. Fire does not yield to peer pressure. Proverbs 1:10 says when sinners entice you, don’t consent. It doesn’t matter how enticing the new trend is, if it is not in line with the word of God, reject it. In 1 Kings 18:22, Baal was worshipped across the land of Israel but Elijah set himself apart. He did not blend with the others around him because He was fire. It doesn’t matter if everyone is doing what is against God’s will, because you are fire, you cannot join them. 2 Corinthians 6:16-17 urges us to come out from amongst unbelievers. <br><br>Matthew 5:16 says that we should let our light shine before men, that they may see our good works and glorify our Father in Heaven. How will they see the works of God in you when you are always trying to blend with people who are doing the works of the devil?",

Wherever fire is, everyone around there feels it’s heat and  whatever comes in contact with it would either be consumed or become fire too. If there is a little fire somewhere and you throw some sheets of paper at it, they will catch fire themselves  . I am charging all believers today. It is okay when you have just come into a school to say, “Oh, we are surrounded by sinners” but after three months, it would be a shame if they are all still sinners. How can you be in an office for three years with everybody there remaining the same? Fire compels everything around it to become like it. If you have not been preaching the gospel to the people around you, where is your heat? Why have you gone so cold? <br><br>In 1 Kings 18:36-39, when Elijah demonstrated that he is fire, the whole nation fell on their faces and said, “Your God is God”. In Acts 16:25-34, when Paul and Silas were thrown into jail, by the time they had demonstrated that they are fire, the jailer humbled himself and said, “Tell me what I must do to be saved”. I pray you will receive the ability to demonstrate the power of God in your environment now, in Jesus’ name. Shining your light would, however, require some personal sacrifices.

When a classmate tells you they are not feeling fine, don’t suggest medication; lay hands on them and pray for their healing. By the time the fellow gets healed, he or she would spread the news to others and before you know it, you would have won your faculty over to the Lord. Is there any of your colleagues who is looking up to God for the fruit of the womb? See it as an opportunity to preach Christ to your entire office.

Fire lights up other materials that have the potential to carry it. <br><br>Fire is always looking out for good materials that are flammable. In Deuteronomy 34:9, when Moses saw that Joshua was a good material, he imparted the Spirit of Wisdom into him. When Elijah saw that Elisha was a good material, he gave him a double portion of his power. Who are the good materials that you have noticed around you - people with potential to do exploits for God, if only they could be mentored correctly? Get close to them and heat them up for God. You don’t know how far that good material around you will burn for God if only you can bring him or her close enough to get some heat from you. <br><br>I don’t understand how some men of God try to quench the fire of others. Fire does not compete with itself. When fire meets fire, they join forces to impact the environment even more. Is there someone else who carries fire around you? Put denomination aside and join forces to advance the Kingdom of God. Individually there are some obstacles that your fire may be too small to overcome, but when you come together, you can bring down very high mountains. When one fire seems to be going down, the moment it comes in contact with another, the new one rekindles it and makes it burn more. It amazes me that sometimes when children of God see another child of God going cold, they would rejoice and say they are ‘minding their own business’ rather than getting closer to the person and helping to rekindle his or her fire so that the person can burn even more for God.<br><br>Fire burns better when it is in contact with other fires. You and other fires around you will burn better if you come together from time to time to rekindle one another. This is why you find pastors coming together to form associations, so that everyone can ensure that nobody’s fire goes down. Believe me honestly, you will burn better if you don’t look away when you notice that the fire of someone else is going down.",

As we see in our Bible reading today, Paul did not allow anything at all to discourage him from working for God. In another instance (Acts 13:6-12), Paul was trying to preach to a governor, but Elymas, the sorcerer, tried to convince the man not to accept the gospel. Paul did not get discouraged; he struck the sorcerer with blindness, got him out of the way and won the governor for Christ. Fire is never afraid of whatever stands in its path.<br><br>I remember when we first went to the town of  Ede in Nigeria to hold a crusade. There were indications of resistance in the spirit realm, but we put our faith in God and were not discouraged. As the programme was starting, it began to rain very heavily. I wasn’t bothered; as long as it was rain and not fire falling, I decided we would continue the programme. Suddenly, as the choir was about to step on the stage, it collapsed. There was a brother there who owned a tipper. I told him to drive the tipper into the crusade ground, and it became our stage. We went ahead to hold the programme despite all the challenges we faced. <br><br>Don’t be discouraged by all those who are trying to stand in the way of the assignments God has committed into your hands; keep going. If they refuse to move out of your way, they will be consumed in Jesus’ name. Be relentless in your pursuit of Kingdom goals. Don’t let lack of funds stop you from doing what you want to do for God. Get going; God will provide the funds when you move. Don’t let disappointments and betrayals weigh you down; encourage yourself in the Lord and keep moving (1 Samuel 30:6).<br><br>Over the years, so many things have stood in my way - including man-made laws. If those who decide to obstruct me    remain in my way, no problem; whatever casualties will result from that will not be my fault.

Beyond that, I’m sure when she looks down from heaven now and sees some of the seeds of that maid attacking her own seeds, she would wish she had kept hope alive.<br><br>While waiting for your appointed time, just ensure that you are obeying every instruction of God to the letter, whether it makes sense or not. Many years ago, we were offered the chance to buy all 40 acres of a serene campground called the “Youth Camp”, for N100,000. That was a lot of money back then. I gathered my people together and we prayed quoting the Scripture:<br><br><b>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.</b><br>Joshua 1:3<br><br>We put off our shoes and walked round that camp ground praying and confessing that it was ours, by faith. Not long afterwards, another ministry heard that the property was available for sale and they promptly paid for it. Our hopes were dashed, but I encouraged myself in the Lord and kept hope alive. Before long, God led us to where the Redemption Camp is situated, though then it was notorious for being a home for highway robbers and big snakes. We trusted in the Lord and purchased the first parcel of land that has grown to become Redemption City today. The Redemption City now sits on an expanse of land far greater than what we had earlier wanted to purchase. Thank God that we kept hope alive for our appointed time.",

      "The law of harvest states that you will reap much more than whatever you sow. This is why you must be careful of the kinds of seed you sow, because when harvest comes, it is always much more than the seed. In our Bible readings for today, we see Jacob sowing a seed in the first passage and then reaping the harvest in the second. In the first passage, he deceived his father in order to get the blessing and so his children also deceived him that Joseph their brother was dead. Genesis 37:35 says, <br><br><b>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</b> <br><br>Many a time, the harvest of your seeds comes when you are too old to do anything about it. Everything you do now is a seed and the harvest will come back to you when you may not have as much energy as you do now.<br><br>I thank God for some of the seeds I sowed as a young man because I am now reaping the harvests. In 1961, as a 19 year-old, I gave some money to a poor, sick old man – a neighbor, so he could get some medicine. The man said to me that someday, I would be travelling abroad as often as people go the market. I laughed at that prophecy because in my village in those days, if anyone was returning from a trip abroad, the entire village would not go to the farm that day. The hunters would come out and shoot their guns in celebration of the person and everyone would be rejoicing. At that time, there were only 2 people who had gone abroad in my village, and they studied there for a number of years. Now this man was saying that I would be going often. It appeared funny, but I had sown the seed. Today, by God’s grace, that prophecy has been fulfilled. <br><br>Beloved, pay attention to every opportunity you have to sow a good seed. On the other hand, always check your actions to be sure that you are not sowing bad seeds that you will regret when the harvest comes.",

Just one mistake can cause serious problems for even your children yet unborn. In Genesis 16:2, Sarah arranged for Abraham to have an affair with her maid and today, the world is paying for that single mistake.<br><br>In Genesis 25:29-34, Esau made a single mistake. He despised his birthright just once and by the time we get to Genesis 27:30-40, the Bible says he came in just as his brother was stepping out after collecting the blessing. He begged for a remnant blessing and his father assured him that he would prosper, living by the sword, but that he would serve his brother. This happened because of just one mistake.<br><br>In 2 Samuel 11, David made a mistake which gave birth to several others. The mistake was that he was relaxing at a time when kings typically went to war. He then saw what he wouldn’t ordinarily have seen – a beautiful lady taking her bath. You should ask, “Why was David looking into another man’s compound?” If you give the devil an inch, he wouldn't just take a mile, but rather, he'll go for your eternity. Before long, the lady was in his bed. She got pregnant and to hide it, he had her husband killed. God sent a prophet to tell David that the sword would never depart from his home. Even today, the sword has not departed from Israel. It all started with one single mistake of relaxing when he should have been at war.<br><br>Some Christians think it is harmless to be sleeping when they should be praying. Before they wake the next day, the devil would have sown tares in their field and they would begin to struggle. The unfortunate thing is that they think the struggle is normal and continue in it rather than get up and pray when they should.<br><br>Beloved, do not be ignorant of the devices of the enemy who is going round seeking who to devour (1 Peter 5:8).

      "Pastors are considered popular when they have many people following them as they follow Jesus Christ. These followers can be called the pastors’ sheep. The devil understands the principle in our memory verse for today, so these popular pastors are usually major targets for him. He knows that if he can get them to fall and even spoil their reputation, their sheep would scatter and he can begin to feast on them. This is why, instead of joining people to criticise popular Pastors, you should be praying for them. If you don’t support what they are doing and you do not have direct access to them, talk to their employer (God) about it, rather than joining the devil to pull them down. <br><br>In 2 Samuel 11:3-4, when David sent for Bathsheba to have an illicit affair with her, she consented because he was the king. There was a huge gap between the king and her husband who was an ordinary soldier. It may surprise you to know that there are some women who consider it a privilege to have illicit affairs with Bishops, General Overseers, Apostles, Senior Pastors and so on. Yes, it is a sin, but the devil has blinded their hearts so much that they now see it as prestigious. That is why you need to pray for them. Don’t assume that they don’t need your prayers. In fact, the more their influence, the more prayers they need.<br><br>You also need to pray for popular Pastors because every now and then, they step into dangerous territories to preach the gospel. Some of them travel through dangerous roads and go to volatile regions to share the gospel of Christ. Some of them also have to relate with the high and mighty in the society, so they need boldness to tell the truth without compromise.<br><br>With the boldness and wisdom needed to draw the high and mighty closer to God, imagine the impact it would have on their leadership and spheres of influence.

Balaam asked God and He said, “No”. The king then sent some other people to tell Balaam that he would promote and enrich him if he would curse Israel. Balaam then decided to check back with God and the Lord said, “Okay, if you want to go, go”. On the way, God sent an angel to block his way. It was Balaam’s donkey that saw the angel; the Prophet, blinded by greed, couldn’t even see what a donkey could. Whenever you are so interested in something that you manage to ‘twist God’s hand’ to permit you to have it, you would be blinded by it and may run into serious trouble because of your inability to see clearly and objectively. If you do a little research to trace the history of Balaam, you would see that he ended up dying by the sword.<br><br>One area where christains often pursue God’s permissive will is in marriage and many of them have regretted it afterwards.

Most of the people who parade themselves as friends are not genuine.

Only a few, and I mean a tiny little number of people can be called real friends.<br><br>The information you let out to someone can never be retrieved, so you have to be careful what you tell your ‘friends’. When I joined The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I became very close to two brothers. One day, God revealed to me that one of them is not a real friend, but a wolf in sheep’s clothing. I confronted him about it and he strongly denied being a fake friend to me. A few years later, when I became General Overseer, I was going to discuss my new role with him when he opened up and told me that he had hated me from the day I came into the Church. Many of us have had similar betrayals; unfortunately, not everyone learns from their experiences.<br><br>Your real friends are those who are happy when you are happy and sad when you are sad. When the soldiers came to arrest the Lord Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane (John 18: 1-10), Peter drew a sword and tried to defend Jesus. How can one man stand against several armed soldiers? He faced them as if it were he they had come to take. That is a friend. Judas on the other hand in John 12:3-6 showed that he only cared about himself and not Jesus. When he saw a woman pouring expensive ointment on Jesus, he should have been happy to see his friend being celebrated that much, but instead, he complained and tried to stop the woman from worshipping Him. That is not a true friend. You need to watch out for these things over a long period of time with the help of the Holy Ghost, to sift out who your true friends are.",

      "Today, I want you to flash your mind back to when you first got born again. I want you to remember how excited you were about Jesus Christ then. Remember your disposition whenever it was time to go to Church. Remember how often you read your Bible and prayed. Remember how desperately you wanted to get closer to God. Now look at your life today. Are you as passionate about God as you were in those days? Beloved, remember your first love.<br><br>I will never forget the testimony of a sister who didn’t have enough money to come to the Holy Ghost Service and decided to watch it on television only to discover she had no electricity and no fuel to power her generator. She said, “Devil, you are a liar. My God changed water to wine, He will change water to petrol”. She poured a gallon of water into the generator, laid hands on it and said, “Generator, in the mighty name of Jesus, start working”. She turned it on and it worked until the programme ended. That is faith. Is your faith still like that, or do you now rationalise everything?<br><br>To get back to your first love, you must once again go back to meditating on His word day and night. You must go back to spending more time with Him than you do with anyone else. You must choose to have Him as the first Person you speak to when you wake in the morning and the last you say goodnight to. You must choose to study your Bible and pray for long hours as you used to. Beloved, remember your first love.<br><br>One thing I need to warn you about is that God relates with us based on who we are and not who we were. He said in Ezekiel 18:21-24 that if a person has been doing good and then the fellow decides to become bad, He would forget the days of good and deal with the fellow based on his current disposition and vice versa.<br><br>Who are you to God now? The wonderful stories of your closeness to Him in the past do not matter anymore; the issue now is: how close are you to Him today? Beloved, return to your first love. ",

      "The world has become such an unsafe place that everyone needs to move around with some form of protection. Those who are rich enough often employ armed bodyguards but this can never be sufficient. Some other people choose to go to the devil for protection but this would always land them into much more trouble. I recall the story of a boy in my village who was always getting bitten by snakes. We later found out that his father had taken him to an oracle for protection against snake bites; that was the beginning of the incessant snake bites. John 10:10 says that the devil comes to steal, kill and destroy. The devil is your enemy; don’t be fooled when he says he wants to protect you. His ultimate goal is to steal from you, kill you and destroy you.<br><br>A woman once brought her four daughters to us for prayers. The youngest was 28 years old and no man had approached any of them to ask for their hand in marriage. After a little investigation, the woman confessed that, to protect her children from dying, she had  consecrated them to the ifa oracle. What she did not know is that, by so doing, she had simply given the ifa oracle new wives. We prayed and God broke the link between the girls and the oracle. The four of them got married within a year. The devil is your enemy; don’t go to him for protection.<br><br>There is only one real source of protection that cannot fail and that is protection from God Himself. Being the Almighty means that He is mightier than the mightiest. Matthew 28:18 says Jesus has all power in heaven and on earth. Philippians 2:10 says that just at the mention of His name, every knee in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth should bow. That includes physical and spiritual enemies. This same God said in Hebrews 13:5 <i>“…I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”</i> When He is protecting you, you can sleep with both eyes closed; no evil can befall you, because you dwell in His secret place (Psalm 91:1).<br><br>Those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High spend quality time with Him daily. They are the ones who abide under His shadow.",

No matter how long you may have been waiting for that miracle, don’t write yourself off. My God is a master at reversing the irreversible; He will show up for you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>In Luke 5:1-11 the Lord Jesus Christ Himself promised Simon Peter that he would no longer catch fish, but men.  Three and a half years later, at a time that it appeared Jesus needed him the most,  Peter denied the Lord and then wept bitterly because he saw himself as a failure. He was supposed to be catching men for Jesus but rather, he was denying ever knowing Him (Luke 22:55-62). After Jesus died and nothing seemed to be happening, Peter decided to go back to fishing (John 21:3). May you never backslide, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>By verse 4 of John 21, Jesus had shown up for Peter. This time Jesus said Peter would not only catch men, but also  feed them. The first sermon Peter preached after that brought 3,000 souls into the kingdom of God (Acts 2:41). In Acts 3:1-8, he made a lame man walk in the name of this same Jesus who he had earlier denied. By Acts 5:14-16, his shadow had started healing the sick. No matter how many times you may have denied or disappointed Jesus, as long as you are truly repentant, God can restore and use you as mightily as He did Peter; all you have to do is repent and never go back into sin.",

Unfortunately, many Christians don’t know this, often choosing to do their own will rather than submitting completely to God. Beloved, don’t be ‘one leg in and one leg out’. Don’t be lukewarm.<br><br>How do you know if you have totally surrendered to God? Check your decision-making process. Do you involve God in the decision on what to do per time? Apostle Paul said in Galatians 2:20, <i>“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”</i><br><br>When you are totally surrendered to God, you would be living to do His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13). Have you really surrendered all to God?<br><br>The interesting thing is that some people start out in total surrender to God, but as He begins to prosper them, that surrender diminishes. When they were living in a small apartment, it was easy to surrender their home for use as House Fellowship, but when God rewarded them with a mansion in a highbrow estate, they would claim that the security measures in their community would make that difficult.<br><br>The higher you go, the greater should be your surrender to God.<br><br>There was a brother in the Church many years ago who never missed a service, but then one day, a man of God came to preach and prophesied to him that he would soon become a millionaire“. Within six months, this brother’s life had changed dramatically. Before long, he stopped coming to Church, claiming that he had become so busy as his business had expanded. One day, I heard that he had had a stroke so I sent for him. When he arrived, he explained that he had the stroke upon learning that a contract had been withdrawn from him at the stage when he should have been paid. If only he had totally surrendered to the Lord who blessed him! May you surrender totally to God as He blesses you, in Jesus’ name.   ",

I surrendered my Ph.D., thriving career in academics and ambition to become the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa to Him; in return, He raised me so high that many Vice Chancellors call me ‘Daddy’. Whatever you surrender to God comes back to you in many folds.<br><br>The woman in the Bible reading for today surrendered her last meal to the prophet of God. That one meal became enough to feed three people for the rest of the famine. The boy in John 6:9-11 surrendered his lunch; five loaves of bread and two fishes. These were multiplied to the extent that twelve baskets of fragments were gathered afterwards. There is nothing you surrender to God that He does not multiply and return to you - absolutely nothing.<br><br>Many a time, God has something big He wants to give to you, but could ask you to surrender something dear to you first. If you go ahead and surrender that thing, then you would get what He had already planned to give you, which is usually much bigger and better than what you gave Him. God wanted to bless Abraham the more, so He asked the man to sacrifice his son to Him. God didn’t need the boy; my Daddy does not eat children. He just wanted Abraham to surrender totally to Him so as to open the door of blessings to himself irreversibly. Abraham passed the test and today, in his seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed (Genesis 22:16-18).<br><br>Don’t short-change yourself. Don’t hold on to crumbs, letting go of great treasures in the process. If He specifically asked for that thing, you can be sure that He has something greater in mind to give you in return. You can either reject His offer or accept it – it all depends on your willingness to surrender all to Him. ",

Today’s memory verse is saying, in essence, that the moment you start sniffing at things you should not eat, you are already halfway into dangerous territory. For example, a brother shouldn’t be going alone on visitation to the house of an unmarried lady – this is a step towards sin. By the time he would be coming out of that place, anyone could later accuse him of fornication and it would be his word against theirs.<br><br>Sin usually starts like a harmless thing, but that is why the Bible says that the devil is wily - a trickster (Ephesians 6:11); if you yield to it because it seems harmless, you are already falling into his trap. May you not fall for the tricks of the devil, in Jesus’ name. Like our Bible reading for today admonishes, you must be sober and vigilant at all times if you don’t want to fall for the wiles of the devil.<br><br>I have always cautioned my children not to employ someone of the opposite sex as a Secretary or Personal Assistant. Doing so would put you close to the devil’s abattoir and if you don’t retrace your steps, the devil would butcher your soul. You would be working closely with this person - many times alone and sometimes even late into the night. You may say I am not modern, but I became born again in 1973 and I am still standing up to now. It is better to be ‘old-school’ and remain standing than to be modern and then fall. Be honest with yourself: you know those things that you are already toying with which  can lead you into sin - for instance, the kind of movies you watch, the websites you visit, the social media accounts you follow, the conversations you have.<br><br>As you stay far from things that will lead to sin, you must also move close to the things of God. You must never joke with your quiet time. That is the time that you spend alone with God every day. Spend that time studying the Bible and praying. You must never forsake the fellowship with the brethren. Every day, draw closer to God; flee evil and you will discover that living holy is easier than you think.",

The second was from the mother-in-law, asking me to pray that God would kill her daughter-in-law because she was a witch. Of course I disregarded both prayer requests as the Bible says that we don’t wrestle against flesh and blood. While that fellow may be a tool in the hand of the devil to fight you, you are not to fight him or her. You are to go on your knees and fight the forces of darkness behind the person.<br><br>There are three types of hosts. There is the angelic or heavenly host which comprises the angels of God as we see in Luke 2:13. There is the demonic host - soldiers of Satan, with their officers (principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world as detailed in Ephesians 6:12). Finally, we have the human host - the armies of the world. The army, navy, air force, paramilitary and the likes are also called hosts. For example, in 1 Samuel 14:19, the Bible talks about the host of the Philistines.<br><br>There is constant conflict between these hosts. In Daniel 10:4-14 for example, the demonic prince in charge of Persia blocked the angel that was to bring the answer to Daniel’s prayer for 21 days until God sent Angel Michael to assist him.<br><br>While we cannot see demons with our physical eyes, they can see us. How do you fight an enemy you cannot see? You need the help of an ally who can see your enemy and help you gain  victory. A major reason many people fall prey to the devil and his agents is that they try to fight spiritual battles with physical weapons. 2 Corinthians 10:4 says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds. If you want to win over the forces of darkness, you need to employ spiritual weapons - worship (2 Chronicles 20:22), prayers (Ephesians 6:18), the word of God (Ephesians 6:17), love (Romans 12:20), and above them all, holiness (Proverbs 16:7).

No matter how strong you are, if your enemies cannot defeat you when you are awake, they can defeat you when you are asleep. You may say, ‘Oh, I have bodyguards watching over me 24/7’. There are enemies that bodyguards cannot even see, not to talk of fight. Could your bodyguards have  protected you from Coronavirus? In any case, even the best bodyguards sleep too. In our Bible reading for today, King Saul was sleeping and Abner - a warrior so mighty that even David respected him, was supposed to be guarding the king, but he fell asleep also. David came and on seeing them both sleeping, took the king’s spear and water bottle away. In the morning, he cried to the king and showed him that even with the best of bodyguards, he could have lost his life the previous night. No matter how many people you have guarding you, without God, you are not safe.<br><br>A few years ago, we had just finished the convention on a Sunday and that night, around 2 a.m., I went out, walking through the camp and thanking the Almighty God for what He had done. For a long while, I didn’t see a single guard. Finally I saw one sprawled on a chair, fast asleep. He had another chair beside him so I sat on it. In his effort to drive mosquitoes away while still sleeping, he nearly slapped me, so I got up and left. The second guard I saw was not even pretending - he spread out four chairs, removed his shoes and lay down. Now, even if they were awake, could they really prevent any evil from happening unless the Lord helps them? Indeed, except the Lord keeps a city, those who watch over it do so in vain (Psalm 127:1).<br><br>Thank God that we have a Father who never sleeps.

      "Doctors are wonderful people and God has used them to save many lives. However, a doctor can try his or her best without the patient getting better. Doctors are limited because they can only try their best; the Almighty God is the healer. I believe that the Coronavirus has shown the world now that only God can heal. For every vaccine that scientists created thinking they had contained the virus, a new variant emerged.<br><br>There are sicknesses that doctors tag as incurable. That word does not exist in Jesus’ dictionary because He heals all sicknesses and diseases. There are sicknesses that doctors just cannot diagnose. My God does not even need a diagnosis before He heals you. A woman who kept throwing up everything she ate and couldn’t be cured by doctors came to one of our services in the RCCG. Just as I was about to start preaching and said, “Let somebody shout Halleluyah”, she shouted halleluyah and a worm jumped out of her mouth. She did not have to undergo any tests, Jesus just got rid of the problem in an instant. In Jeremiah 32:27, God said:<br><br><b>Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</b><br><br>Beyond healing, God can ensure that you never fall sick again. He can shield you from sickness to such an extent that even if everyone around you gets infected with a contagious disease, you would be immune to it.<br><br>Beloved, obey God completely and He will ensure that you live above sicknesses and diseases. You should also note that If He heals a person and the fellow goes back into sin, a worse disease will come on such a fellow (John 5:14) hence a holy lifestyle is mandatory for all His children.<br><br>God is our healer, put all your faith in Him like the woman in our Bible reading today and you will receive divine healing in any area you require it in Jesus’ name.

      "Our Bible reading for today says that Jesus is seated above all principalities and powers. If you are a child of God, you are part of the body of Christ and the body of Christ includes His feet. The biggest demon is under the feet of Jesus; you are therefore above the biggest demon. In John 14:13, Jesus said that if we ask for anything we want in His name, He would do it, that the Father may be glorified in Him. Philippians 2:9-11 says that He has a name that is above every other; that at His name, all knees should bow - whether those in heaven, on earth or underneath the earth. Mark 16:17 says, <i>“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues.”</i><br><br>When you cast out demons in Jesus’ name, they will flee, if you are truly born again. You must note however, that there are two types of demon-possessed people - unwilling victims (possessed by demons against their wish and desiring deliverance) and the willing. It is easy to deliver the unwilling because the host is in agreement with you to cast out the demon. For the willing victims however, they don’t want to be delivered and you cannot force them. The only thing you can do is to find a way to convince the fellow to seek deliverance. <br><br>One day, a man came to my office with his wife and said, “Daddy, my wife is a witch; please help me”. The woman retorted, “Don’t mind him, it is his mother who is a witch”. I responded, “No problem. I will pray a prayer that if you are not a witch, then you would just keep prospering, but if you are truly one, then I will bind that demon inside you so that it won’t be able to go out”. She said, “Go ahead and pray the prayer”. I prayed and they left. One month later, her husband brought her back to me; this time, she was all swollen, because the demon in her was trapped in her body. By then, she was ready to be delivered.<br><br>Take charge over every demon in your vicinity because as a child of God, you have the power to do so. ",

      "Psalm 91:11-12 says the Lord will command His angels to carry you in their hands. Hebrews 1:13-14 tells us that angels are ministering spirits - in other words, they are sent to serve those who are children of God. When people ask, “Daddy, why are you travelling alone at night, don’t you know it is dangerous?” I tell them I have my own bodyguards, only that they cannot be seen - two huge fellows, each one capable of dealing with any amount of confrontations. Their names are Goodness and Mercy. As Psalm 23:6 says, Goodness and Mercy shall follow you all the days of your life.<br><br>The first time you see an angel, you would most likely be afraid, because they are very huge. They are also very powerful - so powerful that one angel can kill 185,000 soldiers in one night (2 Kings 19:35). Whether you believe it or not, the day you became born again, one of such big and powerful angels was assigned to follow you everywhere you go and to do whatever you want him to do in line with the will of God. Anytime your enemies think they have gotten you, your angel can come in the middle of the night to save you (Acts 5:17-25, Acts 12:5-11).<br><br>Now, you must understand that even though angels are assigned to serve you, you still need to give them instructions to follow. They are primarily subject to God’s instructions, so to instruct them, echo God’s word back to them and they will obey promptly. For example, God has already said that they will carry you so that you would not dash your foot against a stone (Psalm 91:12), this means that you can ask God to command them to clear any form of accident from your path before embarking on a journey. God said that if enemies gather against you in one way, they would flee in seven (Deuteronomy 28:7), so you can ask God to command angels to scatter the camp of your enemies.<br><br>You must understand though, that God’s word is only potent in the mouth of His children; if you are not born again, rather than angels obeying you, they can work against you. If you don’t believe me, ask Balaam (Numbers 22:21-35).",

      "When you are a child of God, even when walking in the valley of the shadow of death, you will have nothing to fear because the Lord of hosts is with you (Psalm 23:4). The Bible says in John 11:25:<br><br><b>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.</b> <br><br>Once you become a child of God, death is no longer something to fear. In fact, it becomes something you look forward to because if Jesus tarries, it would be your passage into heaven where you will be with your Master, without pain or sorrow. Apostle Paul said in Philippians 1:21, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”<br><br>My fear of death vanished completely from observing my Father-in-the-Lord - Pa Josiah Akindayomi (the founder of The Redeemed Christian Church of God) and his friend; sending messages to each other back and forth. One would say, “I will die before you” and the other one would reply,  “No, I will surely go before you”. These two men were talking about death like someone talks about going to the market. When you are truly redeemed and know that death is only your visa into great bliss and glory, you will live above it.<br><br>Beloved, I banish every fear of death in your life, in Jesus’ name. From today, you will live above death, in Jesus’ name. I want you to note however, that if you are not truly born again, if you still have pending restitutions to make, if Jesus is not truly your Lord and Saviour, then you should be afraid of death, because it would then be a visa for you to spend eternity in the lake of fire.<br><br>If you are not yet born again, please say this prayer: Lord Jesus, I invite You into my life as my Lord and Saviour and ask for the grace never to commit sin again, to be qualified to be with You in heaven when I leave this earth. Thank You Lord, in Jesus’ name I have prayed.<br><br>Congratulations! Now look for a Bible-believing Church near you to attend regularly.  ",

      "There are many people in the Church who look at the Pastor as if God cannot use them similarly. They think that they cannot heal the sick or even raise the dead, but this is very far from the truth. Maybe you feel so because you believe that you cannot make the same sacrifices that the Pastor makes, especially in fasting and prayers, but that is also not true. Zechariah 4:6 says, <i>“… Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts”.</i><br><br>Praying for 12 hours nonstop would be generally impractical unless the Holy Spirit helps the person. It is the same Holy Spirit in you that is helping those you look up to, spend so much time fasting and praying to the extent that they carry such great anointing. Your willingness and total surrender to God are the major determinants of how much God can use you. Willingness means that if you decide to fast for 7 days and by the 2nd day, your stomach is protesting, rather than break the fast, you would go to God in prayer for grace to continue. If you plan to pray in tongues between 9 pm and 11 pm every day, but you get home very late and tired one day – rather than sleeping off by 9 pm, you’ll still fall on your knees and compel yourself to pray.<br><br>I have always found the story of John Mark very interesting. Acts 15:37-40, tells how this young man - full of zeal, followed Paul and Barnabas on a missionary trip, but got to the mission field and, seeing how difficult things were, especially seeing people stoning them, ran back home. Acts 15:38, Paul and Barnabas were about to go on another journey and Barnabas wanted John Mark to come with them, but Paul said, “No way, I’m not taking this deserter with me”. When you read 2 Timothy 4:11 however, this same Paul now said to Timothy, “Bring John Mark to me, he is useful to me for the ministry”. The Gospel according to Saint Mark is attributed to this same boy who failed on his first missionary journey.<br><br>No matter how weak you seem now, with God’s help, you also can become a pillar in His Kingdom.

      "The Bible reading for today tells us that the day you became born again, God gave you a ‘measure of faith’. Ephesians 2:8 says that by grace you are saved through faith. In other words, if there isn’t that measure of faith, there won’t be salvation at all. This also implies that faith can grow from the measure given at salvation or remain stagnant. For faith to grow, we must take certain steps. Our study today would focus on one of the steps, which is ‘hearing the word of God’.<br><br><b>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</b><br>Romans 10:17<br><br>The first way your faith can grow is by hearing the word of God. Some people wonder why we keep coming to fellowships, listening to sermons and reading the Bible; it is so that our faith can grow. In Psalm 119:130, the Bible says:<br><br><b>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</b><br><br>The more the word of God comes into your heart, the more light you have and the more understanding you get. It’s like someone who is driving a car at night; if the headlights are bright, he or she can move fast, otherwise the person would be compelled to move slowly. If the headlights were to go out completely however, the driver would be forced to stop.  Proverbs 4:18 says, “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day”.<br><br>The more you study the word of God, attend Sunday School and Bible Study sessions as well as listen to sermons, the greater your faith and the brighter your future too.<br><br>God expects us to be deliberate about growing the faith we received at salvation. If however, you have not accepted Jesus as your Lord and saviour, you should do so right away so you can also begin to grow your faith in God. ",

      "As we continue today with the study on how to grow your faith, we will be focusing on memorising and meditating on the word of God.<br><br>Let us consider David. He was a shepherd boy who was not even invited when his brothers were summoned into the army, yet he dared to dream big enough to fight and defeat a giant the entire Israeli military was scared of (1 Samuel 17).<br><br>One of the major secrets of David's success lies in this statement he made in Psalm 119:11: <i>“Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee”</i> This was another way of him saying, “I memorise the word of God”. No wonder he is recognised today as one of the greatest kings Israel has ever had.<br><br>A child once asked me, “How is it that you know the Bible so much?” My response was, “Because I memorise it”. When I got born again, I started memorising just one verse per week. In the Sunday School pamphlet, there is a memory verse for the week. One memory verse a week means 52 memory verses in a year. Since I have been born again since 1973, do the calculation and you will have an idea of how many memory verses I have stored up in my heart. Just one little effort every week and as year rolls after year, you would have memorised so many Scriptures and your faith would have grown greatly.<br><br>You must also meditate on the word of God. By meditating, you are turning it over on every side. Just like a cow would eat grass and then go and lay down in a corner to regurgitate and chew it little by little, you need to go over the word that you have memorised in tiny bits again and again, so as to keep getting deeper revelations that would foster or boost faith. This will in turn bring good success.<br><br>Psalm 1:1-3 says to be blessed, you must meditate on the word day and night. You see, the word of God is God Himself (John 1:1), so when you meditate on it, you are actually exploring God Himself. Memorise and meditate on the word of God daily and your faith will grow exponentially.   ",

      "After studying God’s word, memorising and meditating on it, you must ensure you act on it so your faith can grow. Our Bible reading for today says clearly that we must not be hearers only, but doers also. In fact, verse 25 says that if you are a doer of the word, you will be blessed indeed. In other words, the more you apply the word, the more blessed you become.<br><br>While faithfulness is a noun, faith is a verb. If you truly believe, it would show in your actions (James 2:26). After you have meditated on something you read in the Bible, the next thing you are to do is apply it. Make a move in line with what has been revealed to you in the word.<br><br>When you read Proverbs 21:13 that says you should not close your ears to the cry of the poor, do you apply it? When you read Deuteronomy 28:7 that says that if enemies gather against you in one way, they will be scattered in seven, do you still fret at the sight of them? <br><br>When you apply the lessons you draw from the word of God, your faith will begin to grow. Very soon, little faith will become great faith and great faith will become very great faith. All you have to do is practice what you learn.<br><br>I didn’t start out with the level of faith I now have. I remember very well when I had just gotten born again; my Sunday School teacher taught us then that if a little boy is on a roof and his father tells him to jump down, promising to catch him, the boy would jump. He said in the same vein, when God asks us to jump, we should just jump and He would catch us. I meditated over that deeply; since then, I have been jumping and God has been catching me. So many times, I start projects not because I have the funds required to complete them, but because I know that God will ‘catch me’ and He has never failed. For every time He showed up, my faith grew and my dreams became bigger. I keep going for bigger mountains because I am sure that He lives and is supporting me all the way. ",

In other words, when you are praying in the Holy Spirit, you are exercising your faith. Physical muscles grow by exercise; likewise spiritual muscles.

You will not be destroyed, in Jesus’ name. 1 Timothy 6:10 says clearly that it is the love of money, and not money itself, that is the root of all evil.<br><br>God wants you to prosper because His plan for your life is that you will be a blessing.

I decree into your life: you will prosper, in the mighty name of Jesus!<br><br>Some preachers talk about the story of Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16:19-31, saying because the rich man went to hell while Lazarus the beggar was carried into Abraham’s bosom, then rich people will all go to hell while only the poor will go to heaven. That conclusion is not in line with the story. When you study that passage very well, you would see that the rich man pleaded for Lazarus to go back to earth to preach to his brothers but; Father Abraham responded that if his brethren did not listen to the prophets, they would not listen to Lazarus either. It is therefore clear that it is not wealth that sent the rich man to hell, but rather his refusal to listen to the prophets.<br><br>John 3:1-16 shows clearly that the way to make it to heaven is to be born again. It doesn’t matter whether you are rich or poor; if you are not born again, you are going to spend eternity in the lake of fire. You can be the richest person in the world and go to heaven if you are born again; you can be the poorest fellow in the world and go to hell if you refuse to surrender your life to Jesus.<br><br>Proverbs 10:22 states clearly that the blessing of the Lord maketh rich and addeth no sorrow.

      "There are many people living substandard lives because they don’t balance their spiritual and physical lives. Many Christians do everything spiritual; they pray, study their Bibles, are wonderful workers in the Church, evangelise and so on, but then, ignore diligence in the workplace, the need to eat healthy, and the need to build a good connection with their family members. At the end of the day, they are not pleased with how their lives are and they sometimes wonder why God is not magically making everything right. While you must do all that God expects you to do to be fit spiritually, you must not neglect what you need to do to be fit physically as well. Galatians 6:7 says, <i>“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”</i><br><br>If you neglect your health, do not be surprised when you fall ill. If you sow disregard for your wife/husband and children, you would naturally reap disregard from them too. If you sow lack of diligence in your workplace, poverty would follow (Proverbs 6:10-11). What you sow in the spiritual, you will reap just as you will also reap what you sow in the physical.<br><br>Our memory verse tells of God’s wish for our prosperity, good health and spiritual growth. The case of those who put all their attention on the physical and neglect the spiritual is however, worse. For many of such people, they begin the fire brigade approach of fasting and praying for that specific problem, but may not get the desired answers because there are some things that only answer to a Father-child relationship with God (Matthew 15:26).<br><br>The kind of life that God wants you to live is one where there is a balance between the spiritual and the physical - one where you can live a fulfilled life here on earth and then spend eternity in heaven when you leave the earth. That is a well-balanced life. That is the kind of life you should seek to live.",

When people see you throwing trash on the street or running a red light, what image are you painting to them of your Father? Believe me honestly, when you disobey constituted authority, you have disobeyed God, so when the authority uses their sword on you, God will not come to your rescue.

Isaiah 66:1 says heaven is His throne and the earth is His footstool. According to Revelation 19:16, He is the King of kings. Put in modern terms, He is the President of all the presidents in the world.<br><br>The Most High God rules in the affairs of men (Daniel 4:25). In Daniel 4:34-35, the king of the country considered as the superpower in the world at that time confessed that the dominion of the Most High is forever. Thus, once in a while, when one earthly leader or the other is beginning to feel big and in control,  God teaches the fellow a lesson and shows the whole world that He is still in control. God demonstrated through the Coronavirus pandemic that despite the  sophistication of the leaders of the world, they are powerless without Him and so they must surrender to His Lordship.<br><br>Proverbs 21:1 says He is the one who controls the heart of kings like rivers of water. When an earthly king is beginning to prove stubborn and refuses to bow to His Lordship, He can deal with the fellow in one of two ways. The first is by shifting something in the king’s brain so that he would begin to act like an animal. After a while, when he has learnt his lesson and really seen who is in charge, God would then restore his sound mind and He may even restore his throne too. This is what happened to Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 4:30-37. The second way that the Most High can deal with such a king is to harden his heart and then destroy him, using him as an example to the whole world that He is still sovereign. This is what happened to Pharaoh in Exodus 15:4-6. <br><br>Something similar happened in Nigeria a few years ago when a military head of state was acting as if he owned the country, killing people and doing as he pleased. When his cup became full, God removed him permanently.<br><br>If you find yourself in a leadership position, don’t let it get into your head; always remember God is the one truly in charge.",

      "Jesus said in Mark 16:15, <i>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel…”</i> This is an express command to all disciples of Jesus Christ. From the scripture above, it is clear that all followers of Jesus have been assigned to preach the word but you may then ask, “Who should we preach to?” Jesus also provided the answer in the concluding part of the verse above. He said His followers are to preach to ‘every creature’ and in Matthew 28:19-20 He also said, <i>“Preach the gospel to all nations”.</i><br><br>You may then ask, “When should I preach the word?” The Holy Spirit answered this question through Paul’s second letter to Timothy as we see in our memory verse today. The word of God should be preached at all times. In other words, we must preach the word when it is convenient and when it is inconvenient.<br><br>You may also wonder why Jesus commanded all His disciples to preach the word to every creature and all the nations of the world. Romans 10:13-15 provides a clear answer:<br><br><b>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</b><br><br>It is God’s desire to save the whole world from sin and eternal damnation – but how will everyone hear the gospel if there are no preachers? Jesus Christ said that the harvest is plenteous but the labourers are few (Matthew 9:37). Sign up today to become a vibrant co-labourer with the Lord and you will begin to experience divine signs and wonders in your life.Indeed, the feet of those who preach the gospel are beautiful (Romans 10:15) and he who wins souls is wise (Proverbs 11:30).If you have not accepted Jesus as your Lord and saviour, please do so right away so you can also join in spreading the gospel of God’s salvation to every creature on earth.

      "Not everyone gets the opportunity to stand before kings. Standing before kings represents being at the very top of your career or profession. It means that you have become so successful, you are also a king in your own field of operation. The Bible says that if you want to stand before kings, you must be diligent (Proverbs 22:29). Laziness must disappear from your diary. Slothfulness must not be part of your lifestyle at all.<br><br>You cannot rise to the top of your profession if you are lazy. The Bible says:<br><br><b>The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.</b><br>Proverbs 12:24<br><br>Proverbs 23:21 also says, <i>“For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags”.</i><br><br>In the 1970s, there was a positive confession revolution. Many people confessed that they had Mercedes Benz cars, but you’ll find them still lazing around their homes by 10 a.m. on most days. Many years later, they were still making positive confessions but the Mercedes Benz cars did not appear. It is not enough for you to confess that you will be great, you need to back it up with hard work. Greatness is not for lazy people. Proverbs 24:33-34 says, <i>“Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.”</i><br><br>It is the word of God that says those who would not work should not eat (2 Thessalonians 3:10). He has given you the power to make wealth as promised in Deuteronomy 8:18, but if you are not diligent at what you do for a living, the wealth will not come.<br><br>God can open a door for you, but you would have to get up and walk through it.

      "1 Samuel 2:7-8 tells us that God can make one fellow poor and another rich, He can bring one down and raise another. He can lift a beggar out of the dust and keep on promoting him until he is sitting amongst princes. Psalm 75:7 says further, <i>“But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.”</i><br><br>What does God look out for in the people  He promotes? The first thing, according to our memory verse, is a willingness to do His will.  Once He finds out that you are the kind of fellow who always wants to do His will, then He will mark you out for promotion. If He sees how passionate you are about lifting His name above every other name, He will lift you. This is the kind of heart that David had; it was this passion that made him confront Goliath when he heard the giant defiling the name of the Lord.<br><br><b>And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</b><br><br>1 Samuel 17:26<br><br>In 1 Samuel 17:45-47, David said that the fight belonged to God. He wasn’t fighting for his own accolades; he was fighting for the glory of God. How passionate are you about the will of God being done in your life and around you? <br><br>Once in a while, a fellow could start out pursuing the Lord’s will, so He promotes him or her, but then along the line, the person could get so carried away with power that he or she is no longer pursuing the Lord’s will. The Lord responds by demoting such a fellow immediately and disgracefully, as we see in the story of King Saul in 1 Samuel 15:23. <br><br>Today, when people talk about King Saul, they use him as a bad example. You can hardly find any good thing to say about him. That is the lot of those who, after being promoted by God, begin to do their own will rather than His.",

    bodyText:
      "Beyond the willingness to do the Lord’s will, another thing we notice about people who God promotes is that they are very humble. They don’t regard themselves more highly than they ought. In today’s Bible reading, we see the same trait in Michal as was in her father, because just like Saul, she cared too much about what the people thought, whereas David’s focus was on giving praise to the Lord who made him king. If you can be humble enough to praise God in whatever way you can in front of people, if you don’t think too highly of yourself, He will keep promoting you.<br><br>As far as God is concerned, the one who should be at the top should be able to wash the feet of his subordinates, not one who wants everyone to see and regard him as above them all. Mark 10:44 says, <i>“And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.”</i><br><br>When you are full of pride, God will resist you rather than lift you (James 4:6). If you really want to experience divine promotion, you must humble yourself before the Lord.<br><br><b>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</b><br><br>1 Peter 5:6<br><br>Furthermore, James 4:10 says, <i>“Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.”</i><br><br>One day, God showed me a vision of two graphs. The graphs look like two mountains with a valley in between them. He asked me where I was on the graph, “Top or the bottom?”. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, I replied “The bottom”, knowing that from there, He could then lift me. The Lord then said to me, “If you want to go to the top, then you have to be humble; you have to remove the titles ‘Reverend Doctor’ from your name and simply be called ‘Pastor’”. I did that and since then, I have been enjoying divine promotion. If you would choose to be truly humble, the only way to go would be higher.",

However, storms can be stilled, and from my study of the Scriptures, such an occurrence is the result of a collaboration between God and man.<br><br>When a storm was brewing at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, there was a need for the servants to collaborate with Jesus in order to still it (John 2:1-10). If they had argued about pouring water inside a pot and taking a cup of it to the Chairman of the wedding, the storm would not have been stilled.<br><br>When the prophet’s widow in 2 Kings 4:1-7 was hit with a storm that would have taken away her sons, she was told to borrow many empty vessels into which she was to pour her little oil. That instruction did not make any sense but she did her part by obeying and God did His by multiplying the oil. If you can collaborate with God, He can help you still any storm.<br><br>Some years ago while preparing for a programme in the North, I was told how the sandstorms there could get so bad that there would be no visibility at all. I said, “I see”. That evening, while holding the programme outside as the crowd was too much for the little Church,  a sandstorm suddenly started and people began to panic. I then heard my Father say to me, “Stretch your hand and say, ‘Peace’”. I did just that and immediately, the wind stopped, the sand fell back to the ground and we had a wonderful programme.<br><br>In Mark 4:35-41, the Lord and His disciples were travelling in a boat when a storm arose. The Lord got up and stilled the storm, but then asked, <i>“Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?”</i><br><br>Is there a storm in your life that has threatened you for long? The question for you is, “How is it that you have no faith?” Don’t you know that, if you would only collaborate with God, you would  still that storm? Go to God in prayer and stay in His presence until He tells you what to do to still that storm. A man or woman of God should not be frightened by a storm. He or she should simply speak peace to the storm in the name of Jesus and it would become still.",

      "What you wear matters. While it is true that God says in 1 Samuel 16:7 that He looks at the heart, it is also true that what is inside you can reflect on the outside. The way harlots would dress should be different from the way a child of God does. In order to buttress this point to my Bible College students one day, I bought two oranges of the same size - one yellow, the other green. I stood before the class and asked them to indicate which they would prefer to have. They all chose the yellow one, because, according to them, it was the ripe one and so would be sweet. I asked how they knew and they replied: “The outside shows”. That’s the point I’m trying to make.<br><br>What you wear really matters. In Matthew 22:1-14, a king went through the crowd of guests at his son’s wedding and saw a man who wasn’t wearing clothes suitable for a wedding and so commanded that the man be kicked out.<br><br>I was talking to a relative who was always dressing like people of the world. I said, “You belong to a special family. The enemies are looking at us; if they want to attack, they will look for someone who is among us but different from us. You’re the only one standing out. If they decide to attack, they will find it easy to pick on you”. That changed the person’s mind completely.<br><br>Finally, you remember the story of Blind Bartimaeus in Mark 10:46-52. When he was told that Jesus was calling on him, the first thing he did was throw away his garment. He was saying, in essence, “I will never dress like a beggar again; I’m not going to beg again, I’m not going to be in sorrow again, I’m not going to be in darkness again.” When you give your life to Jesus Christ, there should be a change of garments.<br><br>In Mark 5:25-34, the woman with the issue of blood said, “I just want to touch the hem of his garment”. The clothes Jesus was wearing was the conduit for the anointing that healed her. Acts 19:11-12 tells us that handkerchiefs and aprons were taken from the body of Paul to effect healing and deliverance. Your dressing is important and should glorify God always.",

      "The presence of the Most High God is the best place anyone can be in. Those who spend time in His presence are always in control of life’s situations rather than the other way round. Elijah was just coming from the presence of God in 1 Kings 17 when he commanded that there should be no rain or dew for three years and it was so. If you want to be in control, then what you really need is to be in God’s presence. It’s a good thing we have the criteria required for you to be in God’s presence listed in our Bible reading for today. They are as follows:<br><br>1.    You must have clean hands. In 2 Corinthians 6:17, God said: <i>“Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.”</i> You have to be careful what you touch with your hands. I’ve always told my children to be careful what they sign. If a report is wrong or misleading, don’t append your signature. Don’t steal, don’t manipulate reports; watch what your hand touches.<br><br>2.   Your heart must be pure. Matthew 5:8 says: <i>“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”</i>Be careful of what you let into your heart and what you meditate upon if you truly want to dwell in His presence.<br><br>3.   Your heart must not be lifted up to vanity. Colossians 3:1-3 says: <i>“If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”</i> You must regularly check what motivates you to do what you do. Are you driven by material or spiritual things? 1 John 2:15 says you should not love the world or things of the world, that if you love the world then the love of the Father is not in you.<br><br>4.    You must not be a liar. Revelation 22:15 made it clear: <i>“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.”</i>If you are a liar or someone who takes part in the benefits of other people’s lies, God will keep you outside His presence.",

      "Not many people know what it really means to wait on God. I’ll try to explain it using how a waiter waits on guests at an upscale  restaurant. The waiter ensures the guest sits comfortably then proceeds to take his or her order. The waiter then ensures the order is delivered promptly and exactly as specified by the guest.<br><br>Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 6:13, <i>“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”</i> Having done everything you know to do before God, stand. Once you are serving Him, winning souls, following up on them, paying your tithes, giving your offerings, honouring Him with your first fruits and all else you know to do, according to His word, the only thing left is to stand. You are to wait on Him, asking “Lord, what else do you want me to do?”. The moment you get an answer, jump into action.<br><br>When those who wait on the Lord go to Him in prayers, they pray the way He would want them to: they pray His word back to Him. Since it is His word, He will answer it. They don’t pray only just when they feel like it; many times, they feel Him nudging them to pray even when they do not feel like. Those who wait on the Lord don’t seek their own pleasure in life; all they want is to please their Master. If God tells them, “I need all the money in your bank account for this project” they don’t hesitate; they drop the money immediately. They are always at His beck and call, willing and eager to do His bidding.<br><br>Now, when you have had a very good waiter attend to you at a restaurant, you are likely to drop a tip for the fellow. The tip that God gives you in return for waiting on Him, according to Isaiah 40:31, is that He will renew your strength. This means that sickness and even old age will not have power over you. He will become your doctor, taking care of you by Himself. Also, He will give you wings to fly like an eagle. In other words, you will be in a class of your own. Great men will call you great. You will excel so much in all you do that it will be difficult for anybody to beat your record. Commit to waiting on God from today, He rewards all those who diligently seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).",

      "Many years ago, when The Redeemed Christian Church of God was much smaller, one of my daughters-in-the-Lord told me, “Daddy, you must be at my wedding”. I laughed and said, “Okay, let’s look through my diary for a free date”. We looked through the Saturdays for the rest of that year and even the one after, but could only find one free in July the next year. She said, “Glory be to God; that is the date of my wedding”. The next year came and my mother died in July, while I was in London on an assignment and because I hadn’t written the lady’s marriage appointment in my calendar, my wife saw that Saturday free in my calendar and said, “Yes, this is when we will bury Mama”. <br><br>I loved my mother very much - I am her last born and only son, but because of how committed this lady was to having me at her wedding, I couldn’t let her down. There was no other free day so I decided that we would do the funeral on Friday so that I could attend the wedding on Saturday.<br><br>When God sees a committed fellow, when He sees someone that will do anything to fulfil His will, He will also be committed to that person. Abraham’s heart was totally committed to God - so committed that he was willing to sacrifice his son just to fulfil God’s will. That is why God was so committed to blessing him, even to the extent of swearing  thus, “<i>…By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son…”</i> (Genesis 22:16). <br><br>Some people are not even committed in paying just 10% of their income to God as tithe and they want Him to be committed to their financial success. Some church workers are not committed enough to the work of God so they either go late or miss workers’ meetings, yet they want God to be committed to their businesses. Some Pastors hardly fast and pray for the work that God has put in their hands, yet they want God to be committed to the growth of the ministry. He can see your level of commitment and He is using it to weigh His commitment to you as well.  ",

While preaching, I relayed to them God’s word of prophecy, saying, “There is someone listening to me now who is impotent; the Lord asked me to tell you that He has restored your potency.” A man who had been impotent was lying down on his bed in his house far away from where we were, heard that word on the radio and he was healed immediately. The man ran down to where we were, shouting, “I am the one. I am the one.” I don’t know for how long he had been praying and whether he had given up hope or not, but I am sure he was not expecting God to send a preacher from Africa to him. Thank God he had not give up; he was still in tune with God, listening to the live broadcast of a crusade.<br><br>I don’t know how long you may have been praying or if you are beginning to lose hope, but God can see you and even if He has to bring a man of God from the very ends of the earth, He will answer you soon, in Jesus’ name.

      "If the richest man in the world gave you $100 and then later tells you to give him the money because he needs it for something, you are likely to give him immediately because he was the one who gave you the money in the first place and you know that he can give you even much more again. This is why I am surprised when I see people who refuse to pay their tithes. The fellow who is asking you to bring 10% is the One who gave you the 100% in the first place. He even promised you in Malachi 3:10 that if you give Him 10% of whatever He blesses you with, He will pour down a blessing so big that it would be difficult for you to contain it, yet you refuse to give Him the 10%; whose loss is it?<br><br>In Hebrews 11:17-19, the Bible says that when Abraham obeyed God by taking Isaac to the mountain to be sacrificed, it was because he got him from God in the first place and knew that if his son died, the Lord who gave Isaac to him could raise him from the dead. Abraham knew that he did not produce the boy, so offering him back to the One who produced him was not difficult. It is the same with Hannah after she had Samuel and took him back to God (1 Samuel 1:24-28).<br><br>In all the cases where God asked someone for something and the fellow obeyed, God ended up giving the fellow more than He had asked for. It is obvious then that He is not really interested in what He asked you to do, but rather in your obedience. God is very particular about obedience; if He asks you to give your car to somebody and you refuse, but bought another car for the fellow, you would have missed the mark. He is not as interested in your sacrifices as in your obedience. 1 Samuel 15:22 says,<br><br><b>…Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</b><br><br>God’s instructions are tough sometimes, but when you think about it carefully and realise that He owns everything you have, it becomes easy to obey Him. Don’t become like King Saul who forgot his origin and ended up in disgrace - the same disgrace he was trying to avoid when he disobeyed God.",

For example, a Civil engineer will most likely introduce himself as one. In getting to know the Word also, you must first know what the Word does. According to John 1:1-3, the Word is the Creator of all things. Is there anybody who can duplicate the sun, moon, seas, or the human brain? Do you know that it is the Word that created you? To prove that all His creations are masterpieces, He put a unique code in your fingerprints such that no other creation of His is exactly like you. Someone else may have the same height, looks and complexion as you, but no two people are exactly the same. He made you unique for a purpose and you will fulfil that purpose in Jesus’ name.<br><br>When you see a masterpiece, it is usually extremely valuable, so valuable that no one can place a price on it and it’s thus often auctioned to the highest bidder. Matthew 16:26 says that your soul is so precious that even if all the riches in this world were to be put in a bid for your soul, there still wouldn’t be enough value for it. That is why I marvel when I see people selling their soul to the devil for material wealth. Such people are selling themselves short.

By the time I finished and took a look at those on the right, they all had something in common. It was the same thing for those on the left. Because they were all jumbled together before, I couldn’t see that. The Lord then said, “Solve the ones on the right separately, the ones on the left separately, then combine. That was exactly what happened at the Red Sea. The sea parted, the Israelites passed through and the sea came together again killing Pharaoh and his army.” Five hours later, my thesis was ready. God’s voice solved in 5 hours what I hadn’t been able to solve in 18 months. When my thesis was taken to the external examiner, he read through and said, “Award this boy his PhD; I have no question for him”.

The Bible says in Jeremiah 15:16, <i>“Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts”.</i><br><br>When you eat the word of God, it strengthens your spirit man and you begin to feel a kind of joy that cannot be explained. Joshua 1:8 says if you want to have good success, then the book of the law must not depart from your mouth; you are to eat the word of God consistently.<br><br>Shortly after I got born again, my brethren and I had a slogan: “No Bible, No Breakfast.” We ate the word before we ate physical food. The first thing you must do in the morning is eat the word. You would then be healthy, because the word had already gone in before physical food.<br><br>Resolve today to eat the word of God more than you eat physical food.",

      "The Word is almighty. He created all things and indeed, He is God Himself (John 1:1-3). The Word is so powerful that He creates new beginnings. In Exodus 3:1-5, when God spoke to Moses at the backside of the desert, he had a new beginning. Though he had become a fugitive and it seemed he had missed it in life,  Moses got a chance for a new beginning the moment he started hearing from God. In John 11:39-44, when Jesus Christ was going to bring Lazarus back from the dead, He didn’t lay hands on him; He only spoke and a new beginning came for someone who had been dead for 4 days. I speak the word of God into your life now: receive a new beginning, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Word of God is not only all-powerful but also sharp - sharp enough to separate the joint from the marrow and even  dividing the soul and spirit of a man (Hebrews 4:12).  When you see a hardened criminal crying in front of the altar to give his life to Christ, that is an example of what the Word of God can do. It can pierce into the hardest of souls. That is why it is futile trying to change your stubborn relatives using your own words. Preach the word of God to them; pray that the Word pierces through their souls to convict them of their sins.<br><br>Someone once said that they were wondering how come we usually have such large crowds at our crusades. They wondered especially because my sermons at such crusades were usually simple and the general theme was always: “Be holy”, yet large crowds attend over and over again and thousands give their lives to Christ every time I make an altar call. I told them it is because beautiful sermons with analysis of the Bible using Greek and Hebrew languages do not convict sinners. Deep thoughts and philosophies can’t convert anyone without the power of the Holy Spirit. Simple and straightforward as the word of God is, it has tremendous power to convert sinners to saints.<br><br>If you are a preacher of the gospel, please don’t try to impress the people with how much Greek and Hebrew you know. Just preach the word and trust that the Holy Spirit will accomplish all that the Lord pleases (Isaiah 55:11).",

      "One of the most beautiful things about the word of God is that it produces faith. Romans 10:17 says, <i>“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”</i> The word helps faith to swell within you, so much so that you begin to do things that were impossible for you before. Daniel 11:32 says, <i>“… but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits”.</i><br><br>The more of God you know, the stronger you become and the more exploits you can do for Him. There is just something powerful that consumes you when you study your Bible; you begin to see through the eyes of God. You would start to see situations as God sees them. You would become bold and fearless. Things that were impossible to you before would become normal; in fact, you would experience some miracles that would be difficult to testify of as people would find it difficult to believe you.<br><br>If you can eat the word of God so much that you are filled with it, then Jesus Christ said you can ask Him for anything and He would do it (John 15:7). What a great open secret! If you have been wondering why God answers some people’s prayers speedily, now you know what to do. Hebrews 11:6 says:<br><br><b>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</b><br><br>Since faith comes by hearing the word of God and it is impossible to please God without faith, you need the word of God to please Him. If you are like me, always crying to God, saying, “Lord, I just want to please You”, the solution is simple: soak yourself in the word of God.<br><br>It is interesting though that fear also comes by hearing so be careful of what you listen to. <br><br>Choose to listen to the word of God.

      "Having discussed the word of God in the last few days, I must say that there are many who don’t have ears to hear. Revelations 2:7 says, <i>“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches…”</i><br><br>There is danger in not hearing the word of God because Isaiah 6:8-10 says if you can hear, then you will repent and be healed. That is why the devil puts in all efforts to steal the word of God from our hearts as we see in our Bible reading for today. I am certain that the day you gave your life to Christ, you were not the only one who heard that message. Others heard it and many of them did not surrender their lives to Christ. This  is because though they had ears physically, the devil had blocked their spiritual ears. Furthermore, there are a lot of Christians who have been going to Church for many years; the Pastor preaches powerful sermons, but it has had no effect on their lives because the devil has simply blocked their ears in order to keep them in bondage. I pray your spiritual ears will never be blocked, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There are also people who practice selective hearing of the word of God. In their case, the devil doesn’t have to bother himself, they block their own ears themselves (Jeremiah 17:23). They don’t want to hear that passage of the Bible that will condemn what they are doing wrong. When such people hear me say, “God said we should be holy for He is holy” they say, “Doesn’t he have anything else to say”?<br><br>Psalm 95:6-8 made it clear that if you want to hear God’s voice, “Harden not your heart”. Some of us have hardened our hearts; we don’t want to hear anymore. Remember the rich man’s plea in Luke 16:19-31 when he told Abraham to send Lazarus to preach to his brothers. Abraham told him that his brothers had prophets speaking to them on earth; if they didn’t listen to them, they wouldn’t hear anyone else. They were destined for destruction.<br><br>You have genuine men and women of God teaching you the true word now - this devotional is a testament to that.

      "As opposed to the people who don’t have ears that we discussed yesterday, there are many who do have ears but are too paralysed to practice what they learn from the word of God. They can recall the Pastor’s sermon word for word but they don’t practice it. They can probably even recite the Bible from Genesis to Revelation but it does not show in their lives because they do nothing in line with the word.These category of people are described in 2 Timothy 3:7 as:<br><br><b>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</b><br><br>These are people who learn but somehow, the word does not take root in them enough for it to change their character. The devil practically paralyses them and stops them from doing what they have learnt. If you are in this category, I declare your freedom today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>One way the devil paralyses people after they have heard the word is through procrastination. They hear and are determined to apply what they have learnt, but then they procrastinate until they lose the zeal to do it. The day my Father-in-the-Lord taught us that worldly music attracts evil spirits while godly music repels them and attracts the Holy Spirit, I destroyed all the worldly music tapes that I had. The night he preached about cleanliness, and pointed our attention to the dirt under our beds, that same night when we got home, my wife and I lifted up the mattress and cleaned under the bed and everywhere in our home. We did not wait until the next day.<br><br>That is the same way you should practice the word of God: with urgency! James 1:23-25 says that when you don’t practice the word immediately, it is like not adjusting your clothes while standing in front of the mirror. It would be useless to start adjusting them when you no longer have the mirror before you. Don’t let the devil paralyse you; act on God’s word as soon as you hear it.",

The good thing however, is that if He allows the mountain to stand in your way, it is because He knows you can climb it. For example, in Job’s case, God only allowed what He knew Job could overcome. 1 Corinthians 10:13 says that God will not permit us to be tempted beyond our capacity and He would always provide a way of escape as well.<br><br>Sometimes, God allows mountains in the life of His children because he or she is about to be promoted. Before every promotion, there is always an exam that the fellow who is to be promoted must pass. No teacher will give Advanced-level questions to primary school students in an exam. God will not give you an examination greater than your capacity to overcome.<br><br>In Daniel 3, after all the horrors of going into the fiery furnace, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were promoted. Job 42:12-16 tells us that at the end of Job’s test, his latter end was far superior to his beginning.<br><br>When God allows mountains to stand in the path of His children, He also gives them the required measure of grace to deal with those mountains. The unfortunate thing is that many times, people refuse to use that grace and they just let the temptation take over their lives. There is always a way of escape, no matter how small; you just have to hold on to it so that you can overcome. This is where you need the fruit of the Spirit called, ‘Longsuffering’. Don’t look for alternatives to God simply because you are facing a mountain. Don’t commit sin in a bid to get rid of that mountain because sin will only bring a bigger mountain your way.<br><br>Hold on to God like Job did. Don’t deny Him when you are going through a hard time; Don’t faint in the day of adversity; stand strong, His grace is sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9).",

In 1 Samuel 17:1-51, when Goliath was marching up and down, terrorising the nation of Israel, God was advertising the mountain so that everyone would see how big it was. At the time Goliath was boasting, nobody knew David yet. Nobody knew that anointing had already come on a little boy from an ordinary home; nobody knew that there was a teenage boy who had killed a lion and a bear with his bare hands.

Jeremiah 1:4-5 says that before God formed you, He knew you.  Thus that house of yours started in the mind of God long before you were born. God had in His plan a house that you were going to build even before you were born. Thus, no matter what it is that exists, it has its root in God.

In our Bible reading for today, Amnon went to the wrong person for advice; this led to a great crisis in his family and his eventual death (2 Samuel 13:23-29). While it is good to receive advice – after all,  Proverbs 11:14 says in the multitude of counsellors is safety, you must also be selective of the kind of people you seek counselling from. Check that fellow’s life first; check how close he is to God because he will only advice you based on his beliefs. Are his beliefs inspired by the word of God or by flesh?<br><br>After we had bought many hectares of land for the Redemption Camp, I was counselled not to buy any more land and to build a fence around  what we had purchased. Unfortunately, after listening to these counsellors, I did not check with God before I started building the fence. After a while, God asked me, “Who told you to build a fence? Did I give you a limit to how large the camp should be?” Thank God He spoke, and we continued to expand. Today the camp has become a city.  Before you take any advice, be sure that it does not contradict the word of God and also ensure it aligns with God’s will for your life.",

      "Many years ago, I was invited as a guest to the swearing-in ceremony of the Head of State along with some other persons. One of these other persons was excited that his invitation letter had ‘A’ written boldly on it. He explained to me that this meant he was a great person. Another had ‘AA’ on his invitation, meaning that he was considered as a more important guest than the one with just ‘A’ and would thus be seated more prominently and get more exclusive treatment. I later explained to them that there was still another level which was ‘AAA’.<br><br>Indeed, greatness is in levels. You may feel you are great now, but there is always a higher level to get to.<br><br>Many people get to a certain level and feel they have arrived. The unfortunate thing is that just as there are higher levels to reach, there are also lower levels that can be fallen to. Many a time, you hear of world champions, record setters – great people who were at the top of their profession, career or industry, until someone would come and break their record and set even higher standards. For example, in sports, if an athlete sets a new record, the previous record-holder is immediately referred to as an ex-champion. <br><br>You must never feel satisfied with your former glory; always seek to break your previous records and set higher ones. I was once a boxer; becoming a boxing champion is great, but every boxer will tell you that to remain a champion is harder than becoming one, because everyone wants to challenge the fellow, to turn him or her into an ex-champion. This is why a champion needs to work harder to retain his or her position at the top. The moment you relax, you begin to regress.<br><br>You need more of what made you become a champion to remain one. When I turned 80 years old last year, many people thought I would relax. I told them Moses started his ministry at the age of 80; I too have only just begun. <br><br>Anyone who stops working hard, praying fervently and being generally diligent would soon realise that he or she is going back instead of forward.",

      "When you read the Letters to the Churches in the book of Revelation, you would realise that everything that we Christians do here on earth is being observed and recorded in heaven – every single thing. There was once a lady who agreed to go with her Pastor to a hotel to commit fornication. Before they went into the room, they looked left and right to be sure that no one could see them going in. After they got inside, the lady became uncomfortable and told the Pastor, “We looked left and right to be sure no one was looking at us, but we did not look up; God can see us”. 2 Chronicles 16:9 says that God’s eyes are going to and fro all over the earth.<br><br>When temptations come your way, God is watching you closely to see if you will fall or not. In fact, God and the devil are watching closely. If you fall, then the devil will go boasting to God that he won over you. God forbid that in Jesus’ name. If however, you overcome the temptation, then God will be the one boasting that you are His true child.<br><br>In Job 19:25-27, Job said it didn’t matter what was happening; his Redeemer was still alive. God must have said to the devil, “Did you hear that?” That is why you must fight every temptation to ensure that you win at the end of the day.<br><br>I don’t know about you, but I will never let the devil use me as an object to boast before God. Imagine the joy in heaven when Job finally overcame his temptations.<br><br>The good thing about God seeing everything we do is that when we do good, He sees it, records it and will reward everyone accordingly.  If you have been doing good and it looks like no one is noticing, God can see you and in good time, He will reward you. Galatians 6:9 says,<br><br><b>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</b><br><br>The moment someone stops doing good and starts sinning, all the good that he or she had done in the past will not be accounted for again (Ezekiel 18:24).

      "My Father-in-the-Lord - Pa Josiah Akindayomi used to say that your father can only take care of you with what he has. If your Father is Jesus Christ, then since He owns the cattle on a thousand hills (Psalm 50:10), has healing in His wings (Malachi 4:2) and all good things come from Him (James 1:17), then He will take care of you with all these. However, if your father is the devil, since he is a thief, liar and killer (John 10:10), then he will harm you with all he has. Which of them do you want as your father? <br><br>I realised a long time ago that the devil had nothing good to offer me. I remember about 50 years ago when I was growing very fast. I became a lecturer at the University of Lagos, bought a car and had built a house before I was thirty years old. Due to this fast growth, my people took me to a witch doctor they considered to be very powerful and asked him to give me charms for protection against enemies who may have been jealous of me.<br><br>The witch doctor asked me to come with a live goat which I must lead through the streets of Oshogbo. Since I thought it was for my good, I parked my car and went through the stress of walking a goat through the streets of Oshogbo to the witch doctor’s house. He gave me three amulets in exchange for the goat - one to be tied to the steering wheel of my car to prevent collision with any car in front of me, the second to be kept in the boot of my car to prevent being hit from behind and the third to be tied to the driver’s seat so that if I was involved in an accident I would just disappear. I returned to Lagos thinking that I was super-charged, but in two weeks, I had three accidents! I realised there was no protection in the amulets and threw them into the lagoon. I thank God that since I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ, He has become my Father and the fear of the unknown has been banished from my life. Even if I have enemies, my Lord sets a table for me in their presence (Psalm 23:5).<br><br>The devil is a liar and has nothing good to offer you. If the devil gives you anything, he will take something far more valuable from you. Don’t fall for his deception. Only God can give good and perfect gifts.<br><br>",

      "Human beings are faced with all kinds of wars from their conception all through to the day they leave this earth. Genesis 38:27 says that when a woman is in labour, she is travailing. After she puts to bed, the child begins to confront all kinds of enemies – known and unknown. In Matthew 10:36, Jesus Christ Himself said a man’s foes will be they of his own household. If the Lord showed you all the relatives and family friends who wanted you to die in infancy, it would surprise you, but thank God you survived.<br><br>When we talk about household enemies, it could be your father or even your mother. If you don’t believe that parents can be their children’s enemies, read Genesis 27, where you will see how a mother plotted against her own son and denied him of his blessings.<br><br>I have always wondered about when God told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac to Him and Isaac asked where the lamb for the sacrifice was. Instead of his father telling him the truth, he said, “God will provide”. Isaac must have looked around, shocked as his father was tying him up, thinking, “So I am the ram?”<br><br>What about in-laws? Read 1 Samuel 18:29 and you will see a man – King Saul, being described as the enemy of his son-in-law – David. That is not to talk about witches and wizards, principalities and powers et cetera (Ephesians 6:12).  In this warfare, there are two different hosts fighting for the souls of men. You can either decide to take sides with the heavenly host or the demonic hosts - you cannot be neutral. What determines the side you pick are your actions and inactions. If you pick the side of God, then you will stay away from sin and cling to Jesus Christ daily (Luke 9:23); you will pray, study your Bible, witness and do all that He requires of you daily. Those who pick the devil’s side live according to the dictates of their flesh and commit sin. For those who stay away from sin, they will end up victorious and make it to heaven at the end (Revelation 3:5), while those who commit sin will end up in the lake of fire with the devil and his demons (Matthew 25:41). The choice is in your actions.",

      "Sequel to the discussion we started yesterday, the side you take determines who you fight against. If you take the side of God, you would be fighting against the devil and his demons. If you disobey the Lord, then you have chosen the side of the devil and would thus be fighting against God. Believe me honestly, you don’t want to fight God. He is too big for you to take sides against and survive.<br><br>God has His way of dealing with people who take sides with the devil through disobedience to Him. One way is to withdraw His support from such a fellow like He did in Joshua 7:1-12 when Joshua failed because he had accommodated sin in his camp. Another way is to completely forsake the fellow like He did Samson in Judges 16:18-31. There are many people experiencing either of these today but they don’t realise that it is God fighting them so they keep fighting without realising that the One they are battling against cannot be defeated.<br><br>There was a lawyer who once told me that tithing was just a means for pastors to collect  people’s hard-earned money. I tried to explain to him that tithing was a commandment from God but he refused to listen, so I said to him: “May I ask God to prove by Himself through you if tithing is His will or not?” He replied, “Pray the prayer” so I did. This brilliant lawyer lost all the three cases he handled immediately after this incident. This tarnished his reputation and he lost some business. This man also owned a bakery and suddenly, during a festive period when most bakeries record higher demand and sales, all his bakers decided to resign from their jobs. He offered to double their salaries but they all insisted that they were leaving. Hard as he tried, he couldn’t get new bakers. After he realised that this must be God fighting him, he came to me and said, “I agree now that tithing is God’s will; please pray for me”. We prayed a simple prayer; he appealed the three cases he had lost and won all of them. His bakers also returned to work with him and everything became good again.<br><br>Beloved, disobeying God amounts to fighting Him and woe unto him that fights his Maker (Isaiah 45:9).",

      "To further our discussion from yesterday on the dangers of fighting against God, let us look at what happens when you are fighting on His side.<br><br>When you decide to fight on the side of God, no matter how big or strong your enemy is, you will win. It doesn’t matter if you are fighting against enemies within your household or those outside - as long as you are on the side of God, they cannot defeat you.<br><br>The beautiful thing about standing on somebody’s side is that the fellow is also standing beside you, so if any enemy sends an arrow to you, such a person is also sending the arrow to God. That is why no weapon fashioned against you can prosper (Isaiah 54:17). When you are on God’s side, no enemy can defeat you.<br><br>In 1 Samuel 17:34-37, David talked about how he had killed a lion and a bear and that he would also kill Goliath because God was with him.  King Saul then said to him, “Go, and the Lord be with you”. The boy defeated Goliath with just a stone because God was on his side and he was on God’s side (1 Samuel 17:44-50).<br><br>In Joshua 10:1-14, God was on Joshua’s side because Joshua was on His side. Joshua stopped the sun so that he could defeat all his enemies. When you fight the battle of life on God’s side, victory is sure. It doesn’t matter what comes your way, greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). Jesus Christ assured us in John 16:33:<br><br><b>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</b><br><br>Jesus has overcome the world, so your victory is guaranteed once you are on His side and the first step to ensuring this is to surrender your life to Him.

      "Your biggest enemy is not the devil, neither is it your mother-in-law, witches nor wizards. As a child of God, you know very well that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). The Bible made it clear that you are more than conquerors through Him that loved you (Romans 8:37).<br><br>Your number one enemy is yourself. The one who is truly victorious is the one who has conquered himself. When you live according to the dictates of your flesh, you give it permission to destroy you and it is good at doing that. <br><br><b>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</b><br>Proverbs 16:32<br><br>Samson took down an entire city single-handedly but could not conquer himself. He was so powerful that cities feared him, but in the lap of a woman, he was the weakest of men. Even a little child knows better than to touch a piece of hot iron that had burned him or her before. In Samson’s case however, he told Delilah a lie about the source of his power and awoke to find that she had used the information against him, yet he did not stay away from her. He told her another lie and she tried to exploit it and failed again, yet he did not stay away. To make matters worse, he told her the truth at last and ended up grinding corn for the same enemies that used to fear him (Judges 16:6-21). You may say Samson was a fool, but what about you? Have you been staying away from those sins that easily beset you?<br><br>When a child of God is really fervent, the devil starts searching out his weakness. The moment he finds it, he will try to use it as a weapon for that child of God to destroy himself or herself. That is why you must destroy that weakness before the devil uses it against you. Proverbs 25:28 says, <i>“He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls”.</i>Control yourself so that you would be victorious against the attacks of the devil.",

      "In Luke 4:13-20, Jesus read from Scripture the reason He came to the earth as prophesied in Isaiah 61:1-3. There is however, one surprising thing in that Scripture: He started reading the prophesy of Isaiah about His ministry from the beginning, but when He got to the part that says ‘to preach the acceptable year of the Lord’, He stopped and closed the book. That was not all that Isaiah said; there was more, but in announcing the assignment that He had come to do on earth, Jesus stopped halfway. There must have been a reason for this. We see that reason in Acts 1:8:<br><br><b>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</b><br><br>Jesus came to the world, lived and died, then sent us the Holy Spirit so that we can continue from where He stopped. The first part of His assignment was fulfilled while He was on earth; the rest, as prophesied by Prophet Isaiah, is to be fulfilled through us His children after we have received the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Jesus saved you so that He can use you to save others. The question is: are you a ready vessel or not? As you celebrate Easter, don’t forget the assignment the Lord gave to you after He rose from death (Matthew 28:19-20).<br><br>Does Christ truly have you as a vessel to fulfil His will? Apostle Paul was a man who stopped at nothing to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ. Easter is not a time to just eat chicken and stay at home relaxing; it’s a time to go out there and let Jesus use you to save unbelievers. It’s a time to proclaim the day of the vengeance of God and to comfort all those who mourn.<br><br>Let Jesus use you to win at least one soul this season. Tell someone about the day of the vengeance of God and don’t let that fellow end up in hell.",

      "In John 17:4, when Jesus was praying before His crucifixion, He said to His Father that He had finished His assignment. Later on in John 19:30, He said, “It is finished”; in other words, ‘Mission accomplished.’ After His ascension, He said to His disciples in Acts 1:8 that the Holy Ghost would come upon them and they would receive power.<br><br>What is power? Power in layman’s language is the ability to do work efficiently. The power you need to fulfil your destiny as ordained by God is in the Holy Ghost. In Luke 5:10, Jesus Christ informed Peter that he would begin to catch men and this came into full manifestation 3 years later when the Holy Spirit came on Him and he won 3,000 souls by preaching just one sermon. Growing up, my goal was to be the youngest Vice Chancellor in Africa, but then I gave my life to Jesus Christ in 1973. I got baptised in the Holy Spirit that same year and then something kept moving me in the direction of God’s original plan for my life. I pray that the power of the Almighty God will begin to propel you in the direction of your destiny, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Now, the greater the power, the easier it will be for you to reach your goal. For example, if you want to travel from Lagos, Nigeria to Britain, by road and sea, it could take several days, if not weeks, but if you get in an aircraft from Lagos to London, you would have arrived within 6 and a half hours. In Acts 3:1-11, the power of God began to manifest itself in a great manner in the life of Apostle Peter when he made the lame man at the Beautiful Gate walk. The sermon he preached right after that led to the conversion of 5,000 souls (Acts 4:4). By Acts 5:12-16, his shadow had begun to heal the sick and multitudes began to come to Christ. His destiny was being fulfilled at an amazing pace.<br><br>How speedily do you want to fulfil your destiny? That will depend on how much of the Holy Ghost you carry in you.",

      "Imagine that you are right at the scene of Jesus’ crucifixion and you are looking at Him on the cross. What do you see? You will be right if you say, “I see a man in pain”. He had been beaten and a crown of thorns had been placed on His head before His crucifixion (John 19:1-18).<br><br>Someone else may say, “I see a man who is naked”, because according to Matthew 27:35, they even took His garment away from Him. That is the highest level of shame that a man can experience, to be naked in front of multitudes.<br><br>Another person could also say, “I see a man being ridiculed”. Matthew 27:39-44 says people that were passing by were saying, <i>“He saved others; himself he cannot save”.</i> Though he had the power to call for angels to rescue Him, He chose to endure the ridicule so that you and I can have a chance of spending eternity in Heaven. I want you to imagine the president of the most powerful country in the world holding a device in his hand with which he can call on his army anytime, yet he subjected himself to some terrorists who were about to kill him and were mocking him, “You call yourself the President of a nation with weapons of mass destruction, look at you now, you cannot save yourself”. That is similar to what Jesus did just so that you and I will not perish in hell.<br><br>Without any doubt, when you look at Jesus on the cross, you will see a man in sorrow. You cannot be in pain, naked, in shame, ridiculed, and be joyous. Isaiah saw the scene of Jesus’ death many years before and he called Him a man of sorrow (Isaiah 53:3-5).<br><br>If you however take a closer look at Jesus as He hung on the cross, you will see a man in love. A man so much in love with you and I that He went through the highest level of physical and emotional pain to save our soul. Thank God He resurrected on the third day and has made eternal life available to all those who surrender their lives to Him.<br><br>Beloved, don’t let that sacrifice go to waste.

      "Between every two days in a man’s life, there is always a night. Even Jesus Christ experienced His own share of days and nights. Jesus’ first day came when He was born. Luke 2:8-14 says even the heavenly mass choir paid a visit to the world to sing at His birth. Everyone, including the king knew that a special child had been born. As Jesus grew up, He enjoyed tremendous support from God and performed several great miracles. His first day lasted for thirty three and a half years.<br><br>After Jesus’ first day came the night when He was crucified (Matthew 27). There was darkness at noon as the sun refused to shine that day (Mark 15:33). He was lonely as all his friends had forsaken him. His very close friend even denied Him (Matthew 26:69-74). There was also sorrow and fear amongst His disciples (John 20:19). Thank God the night lasted for just three days. If you are in a period of night now, that night will end today in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Matthew 28:1-7 marked the beginning of Jesus’ second day. Several things happened to herald the new day. First was a great earthquake to signify to the whole world that a new day had come. Then an angel came down, rolled away the stone to His tomb and sat on it. He sat on it to say, this time around, we have permanent victory. From today onward, every door that God opens to you will never be shut again in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Matthew 28:4 says the keepers became paralysed by fear, they were so frightened, they fell down as dead. That is good news for you because now that you are in the season of your Saviour’s day, when your enemies see you coming, it’s either they run or they faint. Jesus’ day is one that will last forever. Soon, He will come to take His children so we can reign with Him in glory. If you are amongst His children, congratulations, but if you are still committing sin, then you are crucifying Jesus Christ afresh (Hebrews 6:6) so you will be treated like one of those who crucified Him. If you are wise, you will give your life to Him now and stay away from sin forever.",

      "<b>A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</b><br>Proverbs 29:23.<br><br>Pride is one of the greatest destroyers of men -especially those who have achieved something great. That means if the devil wants to bring a great man down, he does not have to bother himself sending witches and wizards to that man; all he has to do is bring out the pride in the man. Proverbs 25:27 says:<br><br><b>It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</b><br><br>Seeking glory for yourself will not bring you glory but shame. Stop seeking people to lift you on their shoulders as if you are the best thing to have come into the world; humble yourself. The devil was once a very special arch-angel in heaven, but pride got into his head because of how beautiful he was. He started seeking glory for himself, even the glory of God’s own throne. He ended up being brought so low that, at the end of time, he will be locked up in the pit of fire to suffer forever.<br><br>The prescription of God for every Christian is to prefer others above yourself in honour. Romans 12:10 says, “Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another”.<br><br>The day you forget that everything you have is given to you by God is the day you begin to decline. Nebuchadnezzar was warned in Daniel 4:24-27 like I am warning you now, but he didn’t heed the counsel. Pride rose up in him and he started to boast about the things that God had done through him, calling them his achievements. He was brought so low that he was eating grass with the animals in the bush. James 4:6 says, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble”. Those who want the grace of God to work in their lives must  be humble. Be humble, pride is a destiny destroyer. <br><br>",

      "From our memory verse for today, we see that God resists the proud. In other words, God opposes the proud. If the Almighty God is your opponent, how will you ever win? The major problem of proud people is that they don’t even know that they are proud. They call it other beautiful names like self-respect, self-confidence, or they say ‘I am just honouring my position”. Saul was asking Samuel to honour his position in 1 Samuel 15:30 when he lost his throne. David on the other hand danced like a commoner even as king and was mocked by his own wife. He told her, “I am dancing for the One who made me king in the place of your father”(2 Samuel 6:16-21).<br><br>During praise and worship, you will know who is proud and who is not. Look at children; because they aren’t seeking to protect any position or anything like that, they just praise God, dancing the best way they can. During a service we held in one of the Universities in Nigeria, the Vice Chancellor danced even more than the students. God looked down from heaven and saw that, so when some weeks later the enemy rose up to remove him, the Lord of hosts fought on his behalf and gave him victory. When you humble yourself, God fights your battles for you.<br><br>After one of the biggest programmes we ever held - tagged Lekki ’98, I got back to the Camp and that night during my prayer walk, between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., I suddenly heard God say “Son, bend down and draw the figure of a man in the sand”. I drew the figure and then He said, “Stand up and wipe out what you have drawn with your foot”. I did that, and then He said, “Son, if you ever forget who is in charge, I will wipe you out and nobody will ever remember you came into the world”. It does not matter how high God has taken you, He can bring you down with the snap of His fingers. Proverbs 16:18 says, “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall”.<br><br>You would be wise to become more humble as you rise, because the higher you go, the greater the fall if you become proud.",

Don’t let them send you to hell with their false doctrine. 1 Corinthians 3:17 says, <i>“If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;</i> for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are”.<br><br>You think adultery or fornication is something to be toyed with? In Numbers 31:1-16, the people of Israel were indestructible because God was solidly behind them, but then the enemy decided to send beautiful ladies into their camp and the people of Israel began to fornicate. After that, the enemy did not need to do anything; it was God Himself who started destroying them. If you are lusting after someone you’re not married to, you had better save your destiny by staying away from such a person because that is the strategy of the devil to destroy you. There are many people suffering all manners of plagues because of fornication and adultery. Don’t be one of them.<br><br>If you are old enough for marriage, pray for God’s direction and go through the Church when you want to start your courtship with whomever God has led you to. You may say that is ‘old-school’ mentality, but that is what has kept some of us standing and on the right path of destiny for many decades. It is better to be old-school than to be destroyed. Let the Church be involved in your courtship and make sure that you and your spouse-to-be never meet in private places where you can commit sin.<br><br>There are many people who set themselves up to fall into fornication by being too close to the opposite sex or staying alone in private places with them. Once you notice that you are beginning to lust after someone, declare a fast immediately to kill that lust in your flesh. Lust thrives in secrecy, don’t cover it up. <br><br>Beloved, don’t engage in fornication or adultery; don’t defile the temple of God. If you do, you are calling for judgment on yourself.<br><br>",

There are many Christians who cannot go one day without food. If food controls you, then it is your god and it can destroy you.<br><br>Esau was one man who food controlled. He was so controlled by food that he sold his birthright for a plate of porridge. Jacob on the other hand was willing to stay without the porridge he had cooked in order to get something valuable for the fulfilment of his destiny (Genesis 25:29-34). If you check that Scripture closely, you will see that Jacob even added bread to the porridge he gave to Esau. He knew that the moment was a destiny-defining one, so he declared a fast for himself. Because of that seemingly simple transaction, Esau lost the blessing of his father and missed the chance to have the Israelites as his children. You may not know it, but sometimes when God asks you to fast, it is because He wants to give you a destiny-fulfilling encounter.<br><br>The primary purpose of food is just to give you strength. You are to eat to live, not live to eat. The Bible says that there is a due season to eat (Psalm 145:15). In other words, there are seasons when you should not be eating at all - when you should be fasting. Do you have such seasons planned into your year? Apostle Paul said he fasted often (2 Corinthians 11:27). Your fasting must be often. I have heard some preachers say that Jesus had already fasted for us when He was on earth so we don’t need to fast again. That is a big lie; read the Bible for yourself. Jesus said in Mark 2:19 that after His ascension, His disciples would fast.  He has ascended, so we must fast. Don’t let food rob you of your God-ordained destiny.",

Today’s Bible reading says we must not be brought under the power of anything in this world then went further to show that food is temporary. Don’t let something temporary send you to permanent destruction in hell.How often do you fast? Jesus Christ Himself said in Matthew 17:21, <i>“Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting”.</i> There are problems and demons around you that will not leave except by fasting and prayer. One day in my village, just as I was about to have my favourite dish of pounded yam with combination okro soup, God said to me, “Don’t eat, you are to fast today”. I argued with Him and ate the food. Just as I finished eating, someone came to call me to pray for my sister who had gotten small pox. You don’t face smallpox with a belly full of pounded yam. I had to go stick my finger down my throat to throw up the food. Only then was I able to pray for my sister and she was healed.<br><br>When God asks you to fast, don’t disobey because He has His reasons and it is always for your good. I was never one to fast before. The first time somebody told me that I was to fast for three days and nights without food, I called him a murderer. However, God gave me victory over my belly. I started fasting and little by little, I went from three days to five days and on and on until I started fasting for over forty days and nights. Whenever I am about to start a fast, I mark the days from when the fast is to start to when it ends, point to my stomach and say, “Belly, as from that day, no more food for you until so and so day”. When you are on a fast, you’ll suddenly be more aware of food around you, but you must resist the temptation to eat and stay focused on your goal.",

      "If you cannot control your tongue, it is only a matter of time before you talk yourself into destruction. Hidden behind the need to always talk is the need to be noticed - the need to get everyone’s attention, and that alone is enough to destroy anyone.<br><br>In today’s text, we read about the young man who just wanted to  get unnecessary attention. He formulated a story that he thought would impress David, telling him that he had killed Saul, not knowing that his quest for attention would be his undoing. 2 Samuel 1:16 says:<br><br><b>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</b><br><br>Believe me honestly, the less you talk, the better for you, because everything you are saying is being recorded and will be played back on the day of judgment. Jesus Christ said in Matthew 12:36, <i>“But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”</i><br><br>I was at a meeting with some big men of God and there was one fellow there who talked and talked to such an extent that I said, “Sir, you think you know more than every one of us? If you would just keep quiet, you might learn something.” Wise people listen more than they speak because they know that the more they understand, the better the value of what they say. James 1:19 says that you must be quick to hear and slow to speak.<br><br><b>In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.</b><br>Proverbs 10:19<br><br>Controlling your tongue is a major key to living holy. May your tongue not take you to hell, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Many a time, people have something in their lives that they know is wrong, but say, “It’s not too bad”. By the time you say it is not too bad, it means it's already bad; you are just looking for an adjective to qualify ‘bad’<br><br>.In Genesis 9:20-25, Noah - that great man of God who survived the flood, must have had a habit of drinking just a little wine occasionally. Not too bad, right? However, one day, he took one cup too many and became drunk. When he woke up, he pronounced a curse on one of his three sons, saying that he would become a servant of servants. He cursed his own legacy. Worse still is the second man with this same habit – Lot. In Genesis 19:30-38; Lot had just been rescued from destruction, but he too had the habit of taking just a little wine occasionally. His two daughters got him drunk and made him sleep with them one after the other and he produced children by them. When you go through the Scriptures to see these two families that he produced, you wouldn’t want to end up like them. One set were the Moabites (Genesis 19:37) and the second were the Ammonites – a people so terrible that they ripped open a pregnant woman (Amos 1:13). See what God had to say about them in Zephaniah 2:9:<br><br><b>Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.</b><br><br>All these happened because Lot decided to drink just a ‘little wine’. Stop indulging your bad habits; stop justifying your evil actions. Don’t indulge in anything that is bad at all. Abstain from anything that does not glorify the Lord. Only then can your destiny really be secure in Christ. For some, it is secular music or unnecessary closeness to people of the opposite sex. That is all the devil needs to get you into fornication. Song of Solomon 2:15 says, <i>“Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.”</i>",

      "Anger is one major tool that the devil uses to destroy destinies. Everybody knows clearly that no one just gets angry for no reason, without any provocation. Ecclesiastes 7:9 says, <i>“Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools”.</i> In Numbers 20:1-12, Moses – who had been labouring for God for forty years and leading a very difficult set of people, lost his temper just before he got to the promised land and so didn’t enter into it. Watch it: anytime something is about to make you angry, quickly check yourself; the devil may be preparing to spring an attack.<br><br>Anger is very dangerous. There was a man whose only problem was anger. Whenever he got angry, he could do anything. He had just bought a brand new car, parked it in front of the house and was rejoicing when his son took something sharp and scratched it on the new car. This man saw it and out of anger, used the first thing he saw – a hammer, to smash his son’s hand. The boy screamed. Upon realising what he had done, the man rushed the boy to the hospital, where the doctor said the only solution was to amputate the boy’s fingers. The following day, he went to see the boy in the hospital and the boy said to him, “Daddy, when will my fingers grow again?” The man went back home with a very heavy heart. He then decided to go and check what the boy had written on the car anyway. The boy had written on the car, “Daddy, I love you”. The man was so devastated that he committed suicide.<br><br>Anger is temporary madness; that is why you hear people say, “I was mad with him” and they say it with pride. If you really want to fulfil your destiny, you have to deal with anger in your life.<br><br><b>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</b><br>Proverbs 16:32<br><br>Rule your spirit. Don’t let anger bring you down.",

      "My God is the All-Sufficient One and He is very generous. When He wants to heal, He heals completely. While doctors often caution on the side effects of prescribed medication, there are no side effects with divine healing. When God heals you, He heals completely. <br><br>Some years ago, the wound from a surgery conducted on a woman refused to heal because of her advanced age. I told her daughter to bring a handkerchief, prayed on it and asked her to  put it on her mother. She did so and by the next day, not only was the wound healed, they could not find any scar where the doctors had operated. When my God heals, He does it completely.  <br><br>Beyond complete healing, God is so generous that He can go further to make sure you are never sick again. Exodus 15:26 says, <i>“If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee”</i>. If you make holiness your lifestyle, God can make it such that sickness will become a stranger to you.  <br><br>Beyond making sure that you don’t fall sick again, my God is so generous that He can allow His healing virtue to start flowing through you. All these can be available to you under certain conditions. Firstly, you must be a child of God because healing is children’s meat (Matthew 15:21-28). My God is not a healing contractor; He only heals those who are His children. Once in a while, He could heal an unbeliever on credit, expecting the fellow to become a member of His family by accepting Jesus as his or her Lord and Saviour. If however, the fellow still refuses to become born again, then a worse sickness could follow (John 5:14). To get to the level of overflowing healing virtue by which you would be healing others, you must also have faith. Mark 16:17-18 says you must be a believer. With faith, lay hands on people who need healing and sooner than later, you would begin to see them being healed. ",

David said in Psalm 23:5, <i>“…thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over”.</i> That is God’s nature; when He gives you something, He gives it to you in abundance.<br><br>One day many years ago while I was preaching, the Lord said there was someone in the congregation who would get three breakthroughs. The first was to be given completely to Him, the second shared between the fellow and Him and then the third one would be for the fellow alone. Sometime later, a woman came to me with a huge amount of money and said she had come to fulfil her part of the bargain. I knew this woman - she was a widow whose husband had left a huge debt upon his death.  She however, insisted that the prophecy was for her and I couldn’t do anything to dissuade her. Sometime later, she returned with more money, saying this was half of the second breakthrough. After this, she came back with a testimony: the bank her husband had been indebted to called her to apologise, saying they had made a mistake and rather than her husband owing them, they were the ones owing him! They paid the money to her and it was a lot.  When God sets you free from debt, He does it such that it will be difficult for you to get into debt again. If you are in debt now, the All-Sufficient God will set you free from it, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>John 8:36 says, <i>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed”.</i> When a person is medically healed from an ailment, there might still be traces left behind, but when Jesus sets you free, He does it perfectly, making you whole. If you have been in any form of bondage, receive total freedom right now, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Not only will God set you free indeed, He can even empower you to set captives free (Mark 16:17), so that you would cast out demons from their victims.

For example, when the wedding hosts ran out of wine for their guests, Jesus gave them much better wine in abundance (John 2:1-11). Psalm 68:19 says, <i>“Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.”</i><br><br>In Deuteronomy 28:1-2, He talks about great blessings – blessing so great that they’ll overtake you. The kind of blessing that will cause you to say, “Lord this is too much” will begin to come your way from now, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Beyond loading you with blessings every day, God can make you so blessed that you will become a blessing to others. That is what He did through Solomon. In 1 Kings 3:13, God said He would bless Solomon so much that no king would be like him all through his life. Solomon’s blessing caused the Israelites to be blessed also. 1 Kings 10:27 says, <i>“And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.”</i> <br><br>God can do the same for you. He can bless you so much that no one in your generation will ever be poor again. This type of blessing however, comes to those who give sacrificially to God like Solomon did in 1 Kings 3:4.<br><br>In 2007, one young man came to me, saying he wanted to pay for the feeding at our next convention so I gave him a conservative estimate of what it would cost to feed one million people twice daily for a week.

In 1 Samuel 2:21, Hannah asked for just one boy and even promised to give him back to God, but the Lord gave her the boy she asked for and five more children! I have good news for at least one woman who has been labelled barren: In nine months’ time, you will be carrying your twins, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There have been several testimonies at our programmes in The Redeemed Christian Church of God where people were told by doctors that they could not have a baby and God gave them multiple babies. There was one particular woman who the doctors had told that  her womb was too small to accommodate a baby. She wrote us and we prayed. From that same womb pronounced as ‘too small’ for one baby, four babies came out at once. I decree once again: It doesn’t matter how long you have been waiting for the fruit of the womb, my God will give you multiple children in nine months’ time, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>If you’re already bearing fruit and want more, note that John 15:1-2 says if you already have fruit, God will make sure that you bear even more. Being fruitful is however, not limited to child bearing; it also involves business, ministry and many more areas of life. There are two types of fruitful people – those whose fruits increase by addition and those whose fruits increase by multiplication. I don’t know about you, but I prefer to multiply than to merely increase by addition.<br><br>The secret to your fruits multiplying is in thanksgiving. When you thank God adequately for the things He did for you yesterday, He will do even more for you today. After Hannah had Samuel, she sang a song of thanksgiving to God and He gave her five more children (1 Samuel 2:1-10, 21). When Jesus needed the multiplication anointing to work on the five loaves of bread and two fishes in Matthew 14:13-21, He simply thanked God for the provision and it began to multiply. Thank God for His provision and watch Him transform you from the realm of additional increase to that of divine multiplication.",

The Lord says He shall fight for you while you just hold your peace (Exodus 14:14). He says further in Colossians 2:14-15:<br><br><b>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; 15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</b><br><br>You should be rejoicing if you are truly a child of God.

      "When it comes to anointing, God is so generous that He gives it in abundance. He anointed David in the presence of his brethren in 1 Samuel 16:13, again as king over Judah in 2 Samuel 2:4 and yet again as king over the whole of Israel in 2 Samuel 5:3. God just kept on pouring the anointing on him.<br><br>In Acts 19:11-12, the Bible says He so anointed Paul that his handkerchiefs were healing the sick. In Acts 5:15, He so anointed Peter that anything his shadow touched was impacted by the anointing. Once while on a visit to one of my children in the United States, I saw four women moving up and down in the kitchen. I wondered why his wife had so many people helping to prepare a meal for me.  Little did I know that those four women had been trusting God for the fruit of the womb. In any case, I ate and left. After I left, one by one, the women sat on the chair I had used and nine months later, three of them were already carrying their children while the fourth gave birth three months after the first three. From this moment on, everywhere you walk past will become anointed, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>If you want this kind of anointing, you must be ready to live a life of consecration. You cannot be in love with the things of this world and expect to carry this kind of anointing. Those who are anointed to overflowing are addicted to prayers and Bible study. Apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 11:27-28:<br><br><b>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</b><br><br>God only gives this kind of anointing to people who are totally sold out to Him. When you begin to receive this anointing, be sure to use it, so that it doesn’t diminish. Just as batteries have a life span,  the anointing also has a lifespan. Use the anointing the Lord has given you for His glory so you don’t lose it. ",

      "It is common knowledge that the Church is meant to be for people called out by God. Christ is the Head of the Church because the most important part of anybody is the head. The head is so important that when you want to take a passport photograph, all you take is a picture of your head. The heart, kidney and liver can be transplanted, but there has never been a successful head transplant.<br><br>Is Christ your head? If your answer is yes, is He your vision? The eyes are a major part of the head and we know how important vision is. Where there’s no vision, the people perish (Proverbs 29:18).<br><br>Is Christ your hearing?  If Christ is your hearing, then your faith will continue to grow because Romans 10:17 says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. That Word is Jesus Christ (John 1:1,14).<br><br>That will lead us to the nose. What you breathe in and out counts because according to Acts 17:28, <i>“For in him we live, and move, and have our being…” You are alive as a Christian if you’re breathing in and breathing out Christ.</i><br><br>Who controls your brain? What do you allow your mind to dwell on?  Proverbs 23:7 says, <i>“For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he…”</i>Philippians 4:8 tells us the kind of thoughts we should have: pure, lovely, virtuous, good and praise-worthy thoughts.<br><br>Who controls your mouth? What do you eat? Who do you praise – God or man? John 4:24 says, <i>“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth”.</i> How do you pray? Who controls you in prayer? John 14:14 says, <i>“If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it”.</i> <br><br>You will be a successful Christian if Christ is your Head - the Controller. Our prayer should thus be, “Christ, please be my head”, because if all is well with the head, you can handle whatever is before you. If something goes wrong with the head, every other thing will go wrong.  ",

We are enjoying Christ now because somebody told us about Him.<br><br>We were taught that Jesus is the burden-bearer (Matthew 11:28). Many of us came to Jesus because of our burdens. Nothing could have dragged me to that little building they were calling the headquarters of The Redeemed Christian Church of God but a big problem.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid”.</i> If you are a child of God, it means you are qualified to be called light. Jesus went further to say, <i>“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven”</i>(Matthew 5:15).<br><br>Everything God does, He does excellently. It means His shining is extraordinary. He wants you also to shine extraordinarily. God wants you to shine like Joseph did. In Genesis 41:1-44, when Joseph gave the interpretations of Pharaoh’s dreams, the latter said, “We cannot find another man like this in whom the Spirit of God dwells”. The Lord wants us to shine like Moses. In Numbers 12:3, the Bible said, “There’s no man as meek as Moses”. He shone in his meekness. He wants us to shine like Deborah; In Judges 4:1-14, when it was time to go to war, even the captain said, ‘I won’t go unless Deborah comes along’ and she went with him.<br><br>He wants us to shine like Daniel. In Daniel 6:1-3, the Bible tells us that even though there were three people chosen to supervise other officers of the kingdom, Daniel excelled amongst them. An excellent spirit was found in him; he shone.<br><br>Now as Christians, we will shine by sharing the gospel and turning men to righteousness through the power of the Holy Spirit. In Acts 6:1-8, some people were chosen to be the original deacons, but if I ask you today, “Who is Prochorus? Who is Nicanor? Who is Timon?” you’ll most likely say, “I don’t know”. They were among the seven deacons; they were chosen but didn’t shine. God called you to shine. May you shine so brightly that the name of the Almighty God will be praised continually in your life. ",

      "Anointing can be described as divine electricity. This description will help us understand how important anointing is. If a person is not pure, yet is anointed, the anointing will kill the fellow, because if you mishandle electricity, you will be electrocuted. Samson was highly anointed but spent time with harlots. A man of God who commits adultery has set himself up for destruction. In other words, the combination of anointing and sinfulness will produce a casualty while anointing with purity will produce great and long lasting results.<br><br>For example, Abraham’s anointing was that of prosperity (Genesis 22:17-18) and it was transgenerational because he trained his children in the way of the Lord (Genesis 18:19). Abraham became great, his son became very great and his grandson Jacob became exceedingly great. His great-grandson Joseph picked up the anointing and God used him mightily as well.<br><br>Christians need anointing to execute their respective divine assignments. You may have heard the story of two people who sang Psalm 23 – one a professional singer who sang beautifully and everybody clapped, the other,an old man who sang the same Psalm 23 and had everyone on their knees, worshipping God. One sang professionally, the other with anointing and their results were different. So if you are a chorister, you definitely need anointing. Psalm 24:3-4 tells us the kind of people who can stand in God’s presence; so ushers also clearly need anointing. Prayer warriors need anointing because Romans 8:26 says we pray with the help of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Our Lord Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost before He started off His ministry (Acts 10:38). If the Lord did not perform a single miracle until the Holy Spirit came upon Him, surely you need anointing too. ",

      "God created man in His own image so that he could have dominion (Genesis 1:26). This is why you’ll discover that there is no animal in the world that humans have not dominated - lions, elephants, giraffes and so on. Note however, that the man who really has dominion is the one who has control over himself. You can have dominion over animals, birds and everything in the sea, but if you don’t have dominion over yourself, you are like a broken down and unduly exposed city (Proverbs 25:28).<br><br>Let us consider some parts of your body you must have dominion over. 1 Peter 3:10 says if you want to live long and have a good life, tame your tongue - have dominion over it. The tongue is very powerful and difficult to tame (James 3:5-8) but you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you (Philippians 4:13).<br><br>The Bible also says you should have dominion over your stomach. Philippians 3:19 urges you not to let your belly become your god. If you say you have dominion over everything but can’t control your stomach, you can’t fast, then you have no dominion because you have a strange god living within you. The Yoruba elders say, “There’s no idol like the stomach; every day, it asks for a sacrifice”. You have to tame your stomach.<br><br>You must also have control over your sleep. For you to say you have dominion, you must be able to decide, “I am not sleeping tonight; I want to have a vigil”. Proverbs 6:9-11 says that if you don’t control how you sleep, you will experience ravaging poverty and lack.<br><br>You must have control over your body - your eyes, hands and so on. There are certain things you shouldn’t touch or look at, places you shouldn’t go to, kinds of music you shouldn’t listen to. If you want to finish your Christian race well, you must have dominion over your body (1 Corinthians. 9:24-27). ",

      "Our Bible reading says clearly that God is the One who promotes. God alone is the One who promotes - no other person can, not even the so-called godfathers. Striving for positions and receiving titles do not amount to being promoted. Saul still had the title ‘king’ for several years after God had already rejected him and anointed David in his place. This was why he was helpless before Goliath while David who had been anointed to take his place defeated the giant. When you read 1 Samuel 18:7, you see from the song of the women and children that they had a higher regard for David than Saul even though Saul was still considered the king.<br><br>Now that it is clear that God is the one who promotes, the next question is Who are the people that God usually chooses for promotion? 1 Samuel 2:7-8 says:<br><br><b> The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

God can promote anyone and my prayer for you today is that your promotion will come rapidly, in Jesus’ name. No one is out of reach for divine promotion. No matter how low you are now, God can still promote you to a place so high that  it would beat the imagination of the whole world when they hear your story.

      "I have come to discover from my walk with God that He usually promotes the most unlikely people. Our Bible reading for today tells us that the people who qualify for God’s promotion are usually those considered foolish, weak, little and unimportant. These are the kind of people God usually lifts up because He does not want anyone to take His glory. He does not want anyone thinking it was their achievements that made God choose them for promotion.<br><br>God chose Saul as the first king of Israel, even though the young man considered himself unworthy (1 Samuel 9:21).<br><br>When Saul disobeyed and God wanted to promote someone else to his position, He sent Samuel to anoint one of Jesse’s sons. When Samuel asked Jesse to bring all his sons, David was not summoned because he was considered the least important among his sons. Jesse obviously thought there was absolutely no way David could be chosen as king, but that was exactly the fellow that God chose. God does not choose those who think they are wise, He chooses the foolish. The moment you think you are the best man for the job, God actually sees you as the worst. You cannot succeed at any divine assignment by your own power and might but only by His Spirit (Zechariah 4:6).<br><br>Anytime I travel and have the opportunity to speak with ministers in any nation, they always have one thing that they want me to address and that is the lack of unity amongst them. I often explain to them that the challenge is not that they do not want to be united; rather, it is a question of who will be the leader once they are united? I often go further to say, “If you realise that God usually chooses the foolish one to be the head, you won’t want to be that fellow, because being the head makes it obvious to everyone that you must be the most foolish of them all!”.<br><br>Beloved, if you realise that God will only choose the weak, the base, then you won’t struggle for positions. Keep doing exploits from whatever position you find yourself and rely completely on God as your source of help and direction. In due course, He will promote you far beyond your expectations. ",

      "God usually promotes the most unlikely persons (1 Corinthians 1:26-29), however, once in a while, He also decides to promote someone who has already had some achievements. Before promoting such people though, He would usually first strip them of everything they have achieved then He’ll begin to promote them to a level that is far higher than where they were before. Sadly, those who are not ready to go through this process will miss out on the great promotion God has prepared for them.<br><br>When God chose Elisha to be the greatest prophet of his time, he was already a successful farmer from a well-to-do family and all of a sudden, he became homeless - an errand boy to a prophet who was in trouble with the king. God took him from his high state to a very low one and he submitted to the process.<br><br>When the Lord chose me, I was the acting Head of the Mathematics Department in University of Ilorin. I had already achieved a lot, considering my poor background and now God was saying, “Leave all that” to become the General Overseer of a Church whose total monthly income at that time was less than my salary. It was a hard decision, especially since I had just broken my family out of poverty, but thank God that I answered the call and submitted to the process. Today, God has graciously lifted me far higher than I could ever have gotten if I had held on to my academic career. Once God sees that you prefer His will to your achievements and your ambition, He will promote you.<br><br>The person who has enjoyed the highest promotion from God is Jesus Christ. He was already the Son of God before His earthly ministry. He is the Word and the Bible says that the whole earth was made by Him (John 1:3). He was already big, but when He humbled Himself not only to come to earth in human form, but even to the point of death on the cross, God promoted Him so much that, at the mention of His name, all knees in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth should bow and all tongues confess that He is Lord (Philippians 2:9-10).My advice to you today is: humble yourself before God and He will promote you in due time.",

      "Basically, the reason we eat is so that we can have strength, good health and life. When I was younger, we had a slogan that said, “We eat to live, we don’t live to eat”. The regular meals we eat however, have some limitations. One of the limitations is that there is no one food that has all the nutrients in it, so no ordinary meal can give you all-round vitality. There is however one meal that gives life in abundance. It is the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ. Until you eat this meal, you have no life in you (John 6:53).<br><br>In Joshua 14:6-14, one of the people who ate the Passover meal, Caleb, said at the age of 85, “I am still as strong today as I was 45 years ago”. When you eat the Holy Communion, your strength is renewed; weakness becomes a stranger to your body. Some years ago, I went to hold a programme in a foreign country, and during one of my prayer walks in the morning, I started feeling faint. I couldn’t walk much further and had to go back to my lodge. Later on, I recalled that we would be eating the Holy Communion that evening so that gave me hope. In the evening after eating the Communion, my strength came back to me. In Psalm 105:37, the Bible speaks about the children of Israel who ate the Passover meal: there was no feeble one amongst them. They all had robust health. Sickness will become a stranger to you when you eat this special meal. In John 6:54, the Lord Jesus Christ said concerning the Holy Communion:<br><br><b>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</b><br><br>We eat to live, have strength and be healthy, but the Holy Communion goes far beyond those three basic things. It acts as a medicine - not an ordinary kind of medicine, but one that defies death. Exodus 12:13 says death will pass over you when it sees the blood. This is the blood of Jesus which is represented by the wine in the Holy Communion. I am believing God for you that when next you eat the Holy Communion, death will stay away from your home, in Jesus’ name.",

      "As a younger Christian, I had many difficult questions for my Pastors. For example, since Genesis 1:1 says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”, I asked where He was before He created Heaven, but none of them could answer. Since I could not get answers from my pastors, I turned to God and He answered me.<br><br>The reason we don’t understand certain things in the word of God is in Isaiah 55:8-9:<br><br><b>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</b><br><br>Some of the things that you are trying to explain with logic are far higher and deeper than what the ordinary human mind can process.  In the Sciences, we say, “Prove it and I will believe you”. God however says, “Believe me and I will prove it”. If you are not ready to believe God’s word because you don’t understand it, you may never experience the power in it and you would be the one on the losing end.<br><br>There was one particular question that I had from the story of Elisha and the Syrian army who had come to arrest him in 2 Kings 6:8-23. Elisha told them that they were in the wrong place then led them to Samaria where they were captured and then later released.<br><br>I wondered for a long time how God could have supported how Elisha deceived the soldiers, until the day He explained by asking, “My son, if death were to come knocking on your door asking for you, would you welcome it in? If sickness comes asking for you, will you hug it? If poverty comes looking for your address, will you say it is in the right place?”<br><br>When you have questions, turn to God for answers.

      "One habit that seems to have crept into the Church recently, is that of showing off to other Church members. There are people who go to Church majorly to show off their new clothes or some other material possession. This is completely outside God’s plan for the Body of Christ. God’s original plan for the Church is  for everyone to be united and have everything in common. The Bible says in Acts 2:46-47:<br><br><b>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</b><br><br>The reason the Church is not growing as fast as it should is that there is no singleness of heart. When people prefer to outshine one another in showing off their material possessions than actually caring about each other and the gospel, the Church cannot grow. The reason we have not won the whole world to Christ is that the Church is not united.<br><br>The Holy Spirit does not move in the midst of divided people. When the Holy Spirit descended in the Upper Room, the people were in one accord (Acts 2:1). Until Christians love each other and are in one accord, the Church cannot experience the move of the Holy Spirit as it should.<br><br>Many Church leaders wonder why the Holy Spirit is not moving as much as they expect, not knowing that the problem is in the divisions within the Church. Some pastors give special attention to the rich in the Church. Apostle James said in James 2:1-5 that you should not give the rich  preferential treatment against those that are not so rich, or else you would become a judge with evil thoughts. It doesn’t matter how rich they are, they should not  be praised for showing off in the Church, but  rather, rebuked.<br><br>Believers should dress well and can own luxurious items. However, it is wrong to flaunt material possessions with the intent to oppress others. The Church must unite and cease to be a place where people compete to outshine one another over material possessions.",

      "God never does anything without a purpose. He promotes people primarily to fulfill His purpose. God promotes men so that they can use their promotion to serve and bless others. A tree does not consume its own fruit; it produces fruit for others to benefit from. You don’t become fruitful just for yourself, but rather, so that you can be of service to others.<br><br>According to Exodus 2:11-15, Moses was a fugitive. He was running away from Pharaoh because he had just committed murder, but by the time we get to Exodus 7:1, God said, “See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh…”. God promoted Moses so that he could deliver the nation of Israel. This is why, in Exodus 14:21-28, God could use Moses to clear a way through the Red Sea for the whole nation. 1 Samuel 16:11-13 tells us that when God wanted to appoint a king in his family, He chose the only one that nobody considered relevant – David. By the time He had promoted David, one of the reasons for his promotion came up in the next chapter – God used him to deliver a nation from a terrorist  (1 Samuel 17:1-51).<br><br>When God promotes a man, it is so that he can help others fulfil their destiny. You can help others become who God wants them to be. This is why I don’t say a word when people criticize us for planting so many Churches, because a lot of people would never have discovered their purpose if they were not sent out. The purpose of God promoting you is to help others become what He planned for them. I pray that you will remember to help others fulfil their destinies when God promotes you.<br><br>The Bible says in Ezekiel 22:30 that God sought just one man who would stand between Him and the people so that He would not destroy their nation, but found none. Maybe God is waiting to promote you. If you are willing to help others, God will find you worthy of promotion.",

Don’t try to lower the standard of God because you want to be popular.<br><br>Don’t forget that God is sovereign; He can do and undo. He can change His mind. Each time we read 1 Samuel 2, we love to quote verse 8 and ignore verse 7 which says that the Lord makes rich and He makes poor, He can take a beggar from the dunghill and promote him until he is sitting with princes. In 1 Samuel 2:30, He said to Eli,<i> “I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed”.</i><br><br>He can promote and He can demote.<br><br>Never forget that God always has a substitute ready. You can never hold God to ransom. If He promotes you and you think that without you, He cannot do anything, He would just bring in the substitute. For over a decade, King Saul was still on the throne, but David had already being chosen and anointed king. Saul was merely carrying the title but David was the approved king. Right in the house of Eli, little Samuel was already rising – the one who would take over was already there, in waiting.<br><br>My prayer is that God will promote you, but don’t forget that when He does, you must put Him first and obey Him completely.  You must help others and never use your position to oppress people. Proverbs 22:22-23 says God Himself will plead the case of those who oppress others. Let your promotion birth promotion for many other people too.<br><br>Perhaps you are the one resisting God’s promotion by indulging in one sin or the other.

Just at the moment when you need help, He will be there - in the nick of time (Psalm 124:1-7).<br><br>In 1 Kings 17:8-16, we read the story of a widow in a time of famine. She was going to prepare her last meal so that she and her son could eat before dying. Unknown to her, help was already on the way and that seemingly last meal was the first of many more. Your help is already on its way, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Many years ago, during our annual Convention in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, my wife came to me and said, “Darling, we need N5,000 to feed the people today”.  This was a lot of money in those days. Although I had no money on me then, I responded, “Good, I will send for you”. She left and I turned to the Helper of the helpless,  praying for a way to feed everyone there.<br><br>Not long after, a man was driving past and decided to stop by. He asked what we were doing and I told him we were having a convention. He said, “That is a very wonderful idea. Next year, I will be part of it”. I thought, “I am talking of today; this man is talking of next year”. The man then put his hand in his pocket and said, “But for now, have this”. He gave me an envelope and left. I opened the envelope and found N1000 in it. I said, “Thank you Lord; one down, four to go.” Before long, the youths came to my office and at the end of their visit gave me an envelope with N2000 in it. Within a short time, I had all the money needed for the feeding.  In the nick of time, God sent help to me. Your help will come today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The interesting thing about God is that He is the Reverser of the irreversible, so even when it looks as if He is late, He can reverse time for your sake. Sarah laughed when God told her she would carry a child because she believed it was already too late for her and Abraham, but she carried a child to term and delivered safely (Genesis 21:1-2).

      "The help of God usually comes from unexpected sources like in our Bible reading for today. You might be thinking that help would come from a particular place and then it comes from a completely unexpected source. God can send help to you from anywhere because He owns the world and its fullness (Psalm 24:1). The Bible tells us in Exodus 17:1-6 that God brought water out of the rock, meaning that He can send help from the most unexpected sources. Don’t think of how God will help you; just know that He will do it.<br><br>When I was to move into my first house at the Redemption Camp in 1985 - now known as The Open Heavens International Centre, it didn’t  have any doors or windows and I wanted to move in before October 1. That weekend, we had a School of Disciples meeting and I could have easily raised the needed N50 from my students, since they were more than fifty in number. To me however, that would have been begging.  When God called me to ministry, He told me that He would be my source. I just told them, “I need a miracle”. They all prayed for me and left. The following Sunday there was this young lady who came to my office and gave me money that she had been saving so that she could travel abroad. I accepted the money, prayed for her and she left. When I opened the envelope, it was the exact amount that I needed. One Sunday, I saw this young girl again, gorgeously dressed. She explained that she had just returned from London. Her friend’s parents took her abroad on holidays with them, as their daughter had refused to go without her. They paid all her expenses and gave her a shopping allowance. God used that girl to meet my need, then He used her friend’s parents to meet her own need.<br><br>You don’t need to calculate how God will send help to you; just tell Him what you need and trust Him.

One day while I was abroad, I was told that one of my spiritual sons was in the hospital, suffering from an advanced case of cancer. Humanly speaking, his case was completely hopeless. I went to visit him at the hospital on a Saturday and prayed for him. By the following Wednesday, my son was discharged completely whole. The beauty of that story is that every other person who had been in the ward when I prayed for him was also discharged.<br><br>There was also this case of a lady that had been told by doctors that she had a 99.99% chance of dying from a particular disease. I couldn’t go to the hospital at that time, so I prayed on a handkerchief instead and sent it to her. God used the remaining 0.01% that the doctor left out and to save her life. She wrote a book titled, ‘Rescued from the Jaws of Death’, testifying of her divine healing.I don’t know how hopeless your case seems to be; everyone may have even given up on you, but I decree that God will make a way for you today, in Jesus’ name.

This is because the source of most of them is spiritual and even the best machines cannot detect the presence of a demon. When you cannot locate the source of the problem, finding the solution becomes difficult.

If you are being troubled by any spirit of infirmity, you will be set free today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There is another kind of physical captivity that can come from birth. Some people are born with diseases that cannot be cured but only managed. When someone is born with asthma or sickle cell disease for example, the doctors only have medication to manage it. However, I know that the One who created everyone can create new body parts for those who need them. In Mark 10:43-52, Bartimaeus - a blind man, met Jesus one day and got new eyes. I am believing God for you that, whichever body parts need a replacement in your body will indeed be replaced, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There was this very wealthy woman who vomited whatever she ate. She went to doctors around the world but nothing they tried worked. As she arrived for a programme in the RCCG, she heard me say, “Let somebody shout halleluyah”. She opened her mouth to shout halleluyah and a worm jumped out. From that moment on, she was whole.

If you think that you cannot have oppositions because you don’t have enemies, then you are being ignorant. Proverbs 14:20 says:<br><br><b>The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.</b><br><br>No one would have thought that Bartimaeus would have so many enemies until he began to cry for light. Some people are just not comfortable when they see others succeeding, so they want to bring them down. Like Bartimaeus, you must never allow them to stop you from achieving your goal. It doesn’t matter what they say or do to keep you low, keep doing all you can to succeed.  If you don’t let them keep you low, when you succeed, they will be the first to celebrate with you.<br><br>After you have overcome the oppositions that tried to keep you low, as you begin to succeed, your enemies would increase. This is only natural. Your enemies are few when you have nothing but when you live in a mansion and have more than one car in your house, you will need more protection.<br><br>Whether the devil likes it or not, you will prosper and increase.

      "Rest is very important to God. He rested on the seventh day after completing the work of creation and also blessed the day specially (Genesis 2:1-3). God went on to design various categories of rest periods for man. In Exodus 35:2, God ordained a weekly Sabbath of rest that was observed on the seventh day in the Old Testament. In Leviticus 25:4-5, God also ordained a seventh year Sabbath of rest, <i>“…when the land will not be cultivated, the people and animals will also take their rest from farming activities for a whole year”.</i> Surprisingly, Exodus 31:14 says, <i>“Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for ﻿whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people”.</i> Rest is so important to God that He places a heavy penalty on defaulters.<br><br>Despite the observance of these holidays, the Nation of Israel continued to be more prosperous than their neighbours that did not have the tradition of taking any rest. This is due to the word of God in Psalm 127:1: <i>“Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain ﻿that build it: Except ﻿the Lord keep the city, the watchman ﻿waketh but in vain”.</i> Therefore, working clock round everyday will not make you richer or more productive.<br><br>Jesus Christ showed us the importance of taking good rest in Mark 6:31, when He told the disciples after their very first missionary tour, <i>“Come ye apart and rest for a while.”</i> David almost died in battle because he failed to rest.

Many people, even ministers of God, are dying from stress-induced health challenges due to lack of adequate rest.<br><br>Brethren, rest is divinely ordained, refreshing and rewarding.

      "The Bible takes the subject of love so seriously that it is equated with the sum of all the commandments of God (Matthew 22:36-40). The Bible goes further to say that love is the fulfilment of the law (Romans 13:10). The use of the word ‘Law’ in the Bible, is usually a reference to all the commandments and statutes recorded in the Old Testament. Now, the reality that God equates love to the whole of the Old Testament Bible is serious food for thought. The Bible in 1 Corinthians 13:1-2 says:<br><br><b>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</b><br><br>The passage above speaks clearly about the importance of love and how children of God should rate it on the scale of spirituality. Here, God compared some special spiritual gifts of uncommon value to love. Speaking in the tongues of men and angels means the ability to speak in heavenly tongues as well as interpreting it in the language of men. The interpretation of tongues has always been a rare gift that is highly sought after in the body of Christ, yet anyone with this gift without having love is described as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal - viewed by God as a mere noisemaker.<br><br>Furthermore, the Bible says if one should have the gift of prophecy, understand all mysteries and have all knowledge, with enough faith to do great miracles, without love, such a person would amount to nothing in the eyes of God. Love is the golden rule by which whatever gifts we exhibit and whatever services we offer to God are measured. Therefore, love is the ultimate commandment. Romans 13:10 says, “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law”. The service that pleases God is one from the heart, rendered in love. God is love. If you are born again, you have the capacity to manifest the agape love. It is a compulsory virtue in Christianity.",

      "Love is foundational to the Christian faith. When Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment is, His answer was: Love God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind and love your neighbour as yourself. He then went further to say, <i>“On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets”</i> (Matthew 22:36-40).<br><br>True love is in the DNA of every genuine child of God. Anyone who claims to be a Christian and does not have love as one of his or her characteristics is nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-2).<br><br>If there is true love, then it implies that there is false love. True love is empathetic in nature. True love does not do good for people to see, it does good because it feels the pain of the one who is loved. In our Bible reading for today, James says if you truly love someone, you would do everything within your power to solve their problems. Unfortunately, these days, when many Christians see another who they can help, they would rather pray to God to help the fellow than help him or her themselves. That is fake love. True love is when you make sacrifices to help your brother or sister and do all you can to ensure their problems are solved.<br><br>Some years ago, after a major programme, I was so tired that I just wanted to get on my bed and sleep, but as I was leaving the venue in my car, I heard the voice of a man shouting, “Daddy help me, Daddy help me”.

I therefore asked my driver to allow me come out of the car at a place where I could wait, then go back to get the man. When the man arrived, he told me he had no job and his wife, who had been fending for the family before, had also just lost her job. They had a set of twins and all four of them had not eaten for three days. The first thing I did was to ask someone to bring food for them before we could continue the conversation. By the end of that day, both husband and wife had jobs.<br><br>Love is demonstrated through our actions. Brethren, do you truly love others as you love yourself?

      "The phrase ‘sexual immorality’ covers all improper sexual conducts and practices like fornication, adultery, masturbation, prostitution, pornography, incest, homosexuality, rape, child sexual abuse, bestiality and so on.<br><br>There is a special relationship between these sins and the human eye as revealed in 2 Peter 2:14.The eye or face is sometimes used interchangeably in the Bible and both are very important for effective communication. This is why the Bible speaks of having eyes full of adultery.<br><br>Adultery and fornication are sexual practices that are considered immoral and abominable according to the word of God. Having eyes full of sexual immorality means communicating sexual attraction or immoral interest with the eyes or face. In extreme cases, it could also mean that a person’s mind is always filled with sensual or erotic desire especially towards persons other than their spouses.<br><br>The fact however, remains that the allure of a promiscuous person is centred in the eyes or face, as revealed by Proverbs 6:25 that says, <i>“…neither let her take thee with her eyelids”,</i> and Isaiah 3:16 that talks about walking around with stretched necks and promiscuous eyes. For this reason, painting the face and eyelids was regarded as a means of amplifying beauty and sexual attraction; thus promiscuous people have used it as a means of seduction since Bible days (like Jezebel in 2 Kings 9:30). Meanwhile, our Lord Jesus Christ equates looking at a member of the opposite sex lustfully with adultery (Matthew 5:28). This means that those who deliberately makeup and dress to amplify their sexual attraction are in actual fact causing others to commit adultery on a daily basis.<br><br>Since Christians must be careful not to cause others to stumble, according to Romans 14:13 and 1 Corinthians 8:9, we all must  ensure that we are modest in our dressing (1 Timothy 2:9-10) and conduct so we do not become a stumbling block in the path of others.

      "These days, genuine Christians and even ministers of the Gospel are being caught in various types of sin, including sexual immorality which Joseph refused to indulge in, despite the fact that the opportunity presented itself on what seemed to be a platter of gold. Genesis 39:8-9 records Joseph’s response to the offer:<br><br><b> But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; there is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</b><br><br>It was wisdom, brought about by the fear of God, that kept Joseph away from committing sexual immorality with his master’s wife. No wonder the Bible says the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10). How I wish all children of God would embrace the fear of God so that they can begin to live above temptation and sin. It is wisdom to run away from sin because the Bible says in Romans 6:23, <i>“The wages of sin is death…”</i> and this refers to eternal death. Beloved, sexual immorality is forbidden; seek godly wisdom to avoid this deadly sin.<br><br>In the last hour before the arrest of Jesus Christ, He had a foreknowledge of what was about to happen to Him and thus had a private meeting with His disciples at Gethsemane, where He gave them the antidote to temptation and sin. Matthew 26:41 says, <i>“Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak..”</i> In this passage, Jesus named watchfulness and prayer as the antidote to temptation and sin.<br><br> We are therefore called to be alert to dangers in the Christian journey such as sexual immorality, false teachings, worldliness, love of money, inordinate ambition, sinful pleasure, and other forms of temptation and sin. The Bible says the end is near so we should be sober and watch unto prayer (1 Peter 4:7).  Sexual immorality is forbidden; watch and pray over the type of content you and your family consume. Be mindful of your physical and social interactions, and constantly fill your heart with the word of God so you do not sin against Him (Psalm 119:11).",

      "You should do a thorough check on your friends to see if they are headed for heaven. There are some people who should clearly be avoided, while others may look good on the outside but deep inside, are not who they pretend to be. You need to stay away from such friends.<br><br>There are some character flaws you should look out for and ensure you do not keep people who have such as friends. For example, if your friend’s temper runs hot, stay away from him or her, so you don’t learn his or her ways and ensnare your soul (Proverbs 22:24-25).<br><br>Many years ago, I was working as a teacher and befriended a colleague who was from the same part of the country as I. I however, didn’t know much about him. One day on our way to Ibadan for a teachers’ programme, we got off the lorry in Ile-Ife, where we would board another to Ibadan. This friend of mine then said he wanted to say hello to a chief nearby and asked me to come along. I did, after all, we were friends. We got there, he knocked on a door and was asked a strange question from inside, “is it a fish or a crab?” My friend answered and said, “One fish and one crab”. We were let in, but as we left, I began to wonder what these strange statements meant. When we arrived in Ibadan, he said he wanted to visit another fellow. I followed him, he knocked at the door and was asked, “Who is that? a goat or a sheep?” My friend answered, “One goat, one sheep”. By now, I was seriously troubled. I got home and asked the elders what the statements meant. They said, knowingly, “Ah, where did you hear that?”<br><br>That was the end of my friendship with that fellow. Up to today, I don’t understand what those statements really meant, but I didn’t have to be told that they were occultic and dangerous. Check your friends, be watchful and careful. The Bible says evil communication corrupts good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33). The Romans used to say, “As bad apples spoil good ones, so do bad friends spoil good boys”.<br><br>Before today is out, do a thorough check on all your friends. If there are some that are not living a holy life, preach the word of God to them and if they refuse to change, please separate yourself from such persons immediately. ",

      "Every truly wise person knows that the Maker of heaven and earth should be feared. This is why Proverbs 9:10 says:<br><br><b>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</b><br><br>There is no greater foolishness than disregard for God. How can you fear people who are limited in power and authority, then have no fear for the One who can do as He pleases, who is answerable to no one (Daniel 4:35)?<br><br>If you can fear those who can kill your body, how much more the One who can destroy both your body and soul in hell (Matthew 10:28)? God should never be toyed with. I know there are people who tell you that you are not to fear God, but to just reverence Him. I don’t know if they read that from their Bible, but my own Bible does not say the reverence of God is the beginning of wisdom, but rather, the fear of the Lord.<br><br>I don’t play carelessly with fire. No matter how cold I get, I don’t put my hand in it because I fear it.  Our God is the Consuming Fire (Hebrews 12:29). You should therefore not only reverence Him, but fear Him also. Even a mad dog recognises fire when it sees it and does not play carelessly with it.<br><br>If you don’t fear God, you are capable of doing any evil. The interesting thing is that, whether you fear fire or not, if you touch it, it will burn you. If, as a result of the fact that you have no fear of God you continue to commit sin, it is only a matter of time before the repercussions would start coming.<br><br>A person may enjoy the pleasures of sin here on earth, and may even be popular for being such a great sinner, but a time is coming when the person will leave this world and then face the judgement of God which will lead to eternal damnation for such a person.<br><br>Beloved, it is better to fear God, live holy and receive eternal life than to disregard Him here on earth and spend eternity burning in the lake of fire.

      "Submission is different from cooperation. Cooperation is when you work together with someone to achieve a mutually desired goal. Submission on the other hand, is when you want something totally different from what the other fellow wants, but because you have to submit, you do what he or she asks you to.<br><br>One who submits to God is that fellow who will do whatever God says – whether it is logical or not, convenient or not. Those who put their own wishes aside and just say, “If this is what God says, that is what I will do”. Once the devil knows you are that submissive to God, when you begin to resist him, he will flee. James 4:7 says:<br><br><b>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</b> <br><br>The devil knows those who are 100% submissive to God. Those who will do whatever God says even if they have to die doing it. On the other hand, he knows those who are submissive to their bellies or their sexual drive; those who are lovers of the world and those who are in it. It is only when your submission to God is complete that you can have the authority to revenge any disobedience (2 Corinthians 10:6).<br><br>If you want to resist the devil so that he will flee from you, then you have to be completely submissive to God. Who you submit to determines how much authority you have. The commissioner of works submits to the governor of his state; he does not have as much authority as the minister of works who submits to the president. In Matthew 8:9, the Centurion said, <i>“For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it”.</i><br><br>When you are truly submissive to God, then He gives you some of His authority so that once you speak, the devil trembles and flees. Some of those troubles the devil is causing in your life can be stopped once you submit to God.",

      "It is true that we wrestle with many external enemies described as principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12). Many people however, fight against themselves thereby constituting an internal enemy to themselves. <br><br>For example, there are many people who believe they are free to do anything they wish with their body; they therefore would not deny themselves anything their heart desires. This mindset often leads to sinful practices like indecent dressing, drunkenness, sexual immorality, gluttony, lasciviousness, idolatry, anger, selfishness, drug addiction and the likes. Such practices often produce results that are detrimental to the body, sometimes generating life-threatening repercussions. These sinful practices should therefore be correctly identified as internal enemies of all human beings. 1 Corinthians 3:17 says:<br><br><b>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</b><br><br>This is an important statement with a very serious implication. The Almighty God, our Creator, wants us to know that He created us as His own dwelling place. He went on to say that if anyone defiles the temple of God, he or she shall be destroyed. This is probably the source of the increase in strange ailments and reduction in life expectancy across the world. Those who defile or abuse their bodies with alcohol, hard drugs, sexual immorality, unhygienic food and unhealthy exposure to dangerous substances often become sick and end up dying prematurely. Many incidents of youths all over the world dying from drug addiction, mental illness, hypertension, suicide, liver-related problems and so on are traceable to these internal enemies. Mark 7:23 tells us that all these evil things come from within and defile the man (the temple of God), while Galatians 5:21 says without exception that everyone who practices such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",

Psalm 108:4 says:<br><br><b>For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.</b><br><br>The gate of mercy is so wide that it can take everybody in the world (John 3:16); however, this gate of mercy can be shut suddenly, in a way that no one can explain. The gate of mercy can snap shut within the twinkling of an eye. Proverbs 29:1 says, <i>“He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy”.</i><br><br>Many a time when the gate makes an attempt to snap shut, God’s love will push it open again, but a time would come when it will snap shut and nothing can open it again.<br><br>Some years ago, a woman was very sick and the doctors said there was nothing more they could do for her so her relatives brought her to me for prayers. As I laid my hand on her, I felt the anointing like hot oil flow through my hand, but as it got to her head, it returned immediately. I asked God why and He said, “I have had mercy and warned her several times, but she wouldn’t listen. It is now my turn to refuse to heal her.” I ran to the altar and cried to God, saying, “Please Lord, You said You don’t want the destruction of a sinner and Your mercy endures forever; please have mercy!” I ran back to her and placed my hand on head again but the same thing happened. I ran back to the altar, pleading for God to have mercy on her, but by the time I went three times and returned to lay hands on her again, she was dead.<br><br>Remember the story of the fruitless tree in Luke 13:6-9? God said, “For three years I have examined this tree and done everything I could for it, yet it bore no fruit; I will cut it down”. Mercy said, “Give it another chance, another year, to see what happens; if it still doesn’t bring forth fruit, You can then cut it”.<br><br>You don’t know when your last chance will be. You don’t know if the last time you sinned was your last chance before the gate of mercy shuts against you. Surrender completely to Jesus Christ now before it is too late.",

Examples of such  weapons in the Bible include the rod of Moses in Exodus 14:13-16, the shout of Hallelujah that brought down the walls of Jericho in Joshua 6:20, prayer and praise that caused the chains of Paul, Silas, and all the other prisoners to be broken (Acts 16:25-26), and many more. These examples show how divine weapons that seem unimportant to the enemy were deployed to accomplish great victories for the people of God.<br><br>We also have clear examples of what happens when children are used to symbolise divine weapons. Psalm 127:3-5 says:<br><br><b>Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: And the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; So are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be ashamed, But they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</b><br><br>The above passage confirms that though children have biological parents, they are of divine origin. Children are compared with arrows which require much skill, craftsmanship, and training before they can be used effectively. So also, children need the knowledge of the word of God, good education, discipline and godly upbringing, to assume the leadership positions that God has in store for them in life.<br><br>The passage further tells us that they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. In Bible days, the city gate was like a public square, the gathering place where elders sat to settle disputes, render judgment, and make important decisions. Boaz settled the issue of his marriage to Ruth at the city gate in Ruth 4:1-6. Parents of godly children have nothing to be ashamed of, they can move about with their heads held up high at any public gathering. Godly children are indeed weapons in the hand of God.",

I would like you to keep every season in mind to help you get a good grasp of the entire message.<br><br>The first season of a person’s life is when he or she is still young and desires material possessions. When a child is born, without being taught, he or she tightly grips anything placed in his or her hand and, should the item fall, would cry to get it back. That is the first season of life – when the fellow just wants to acquire. It is in this season that many people get certificates so that they can get high-paying jobs. Everything that a person does during this season is usually geared towards becoming rich. Unfortunately, it is in this season that many people are lured by the devil into illegal and immoral activities to get money. When you check the people who have been proven to engage in  ‘yahoo yahoo’ (cybercrime), or ladies selling their bodies for money, even those who kidnap and rob, you would find that they are usually young people. If you are young and don’t have an inordinate ambition to be rich, then you will be safe from the lures of the devil. Though it is good to be rich, you should not pursue wealth at the expense of your soul.<br><br>After chasing money for so long, the young fellow will at some point look around and see that even money does not satisfy (Ecclesiastes 5:10). He or she would realise the truth in the Scripture in Luke 12:15 which says, <i>“And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”</i><br><br>Many years ago, whenever I visited America and Pastor Stephen Rathod picked me up, the first thing I used to ask him, after exchanging greetings, was, “Where are they having sales?” It was very important to me to buy things in America during the sales period. Years later, when I visited the US again, he was surprised I didn’t ask to be shown where I could buy things on sales.  I told him that time had passed. I had realised that those things didn’t really matter. I was now after more important things.",

      "We discussed the first season of life yesterday and will be discussing the second season today. In the second season of life, a person’s greatest desire will be to impress. At this stage, he or she wants to be perceived as a success by everyone. For example, choristers and pastors in this stage will typically seek to impress others when they sing and preach respectively. A person in this stage may be financially comfortable already, but would be seeking prestige. This is the season that King Saul was in 1 Samuel 15:24.<br><br><b>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</b><br><br>King Saul had money and power, but he also wanted to impress the people and that got him into trouble.<br><br>If you are doing things because of what people think of you, you are likely to get into big trouble soon. The cheer of people may seem good now, but soon you will realise that those who are shouting,Hosanna today” will be the same ones shouting, “Crucify Him” tomorrow. This is why you must shun what people think and do what is right, whether it is the popular opinion or not.<br><br>The Holy Ghost Congress which we hold in Nigeria is a week-long programme, with Friday recording the largest attendance - running into millions. There was a singer who was invited to minister on the Thursday of the Congress. She refused, saying she would only come to sing on Friday when the crowd would be largest. Of course we withdrew the invitation because she was not interested in singing for God but for the crowd.<br><br>Those who are more concerned about how they look on social media are risking being destroyed by the same people they are trying to impress. Think about it: if you are trying to impress people, it means that you will always want to jump on the next trend. Trends never end; this means that you would be caught in a never-ending rat race.

      "We discussed the first and second seasons of life over the past two days and will progress to discuss the third season of life today. In the third season of a person’s life, he or she moves from trying to impress people to trying to <i>influence people</i> This is the period where a person wants to become a voice. This is the season when you want to say like Apostle Paul:<br><br><b>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</b><br>1 Corinthians 11:1<br><br>Many times, people in this season look for others in the younger generation to mentor. In this season, you would become hungry to pass on knowledge to others. When you get to this stage, you are now maturing because you are after impact more than anything else.<br><br><b>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</b><br>2 Timothy 2:2 <br><br>If you fail to properly learn the truth about life, you would begin to pass on your erroneous understanding to others and hence become a negative influence and not a positive one.  You must be careful in this season not to spread a virus in the systems of people. When people seem to have found someone whose message they enjoy, they begin to spread it and before long, that message would have become a doctrine. What we know today as the extreme and erroneous message of grace was started by a man called Nicholas. He was amongst the first deacons (Acts 6:5); however, he had adopted an erroneous way of living a so-called Christian life and by the time we get to Revelation 2:15, we see that his erroneous way had become a misleading doctrine within the Church, as it still is today.<br><br>In this third season of life, your lifestyle and behaviour will also begin to influence others.An example can be seen in 2 Peter 2:15 where some Christians were described to be following in the steps of Balaam who chose to use the power of God for material gains. Beloved, it is very dangerous to mislead those who look up to you. You must be particularly careful not to influence others negatively (Matthew 18:6).",

      "Today we will discuss the fourth season of life. This is a period when you are primarily focused on fulfilling your  purpose in life.  At this stage, you suddenly realise that you do not have much time left and if you are not careful, you may not fulfil your purpose in life.<br><br>Being in this season of life is however, not a function of age. At whatever age you suddenly realise you need to wake up to the need to fulfil your purpose in life and that is all that matters to you, you have entered into the fourth season of life. In this season, you are not concerned so much about how much you have done; rather, your major concern is if you have done what you were created to do.<br><br>In Joshua 12, you can see Joshua boasting about the kings he defeated, but when we get to Joshua 13:1 we see how far he had actually gone in the fulfilment of his destiny.<br><br><b>Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</b><br>Joshua 13:1<br><br>Joshua appeared to have achieved a lot, but he was still very far from reaching his goal in life. There is a big difference between what you achieve and whether you fulfil your destiny. Unfortunately, many people go in the wrong direction all their lives only to discover at the end that they were on the wrong path. This is a big disaster.<br><br>Apostle Paul was one man who was determined to fulfil his purpose. He said in Acts 20:24:<br><br><b>But none of these things move me,   neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</b><br><br>Thus when he was about to leave the earth, he left a fulfilled man and said in 2 Timothy 4:7:<br><br><b>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</b><br><br>Are you working towards fulfilling destiny?

At this stage, you are asking, “What legacy am I going to leave behind if God calls me home today?” At this point, you are not thinking of what happens while you are still here on earth; all that you start pursuing is a great legacy for yourself.<br><br>When you read 2 Timothy 4:7 and then backtrack to two chapters before that, you would see what Paul was telling Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:2:<br><br><b>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</b><br><br>He wanted to ensure that the things he stood for – his legacy, didn’t die with him.

There are people who pursued many things at the expense of their families only to later realise that the children they neglected were the only ones they could rely on to continue with their legacy. If you really want to have a great legacy, you must spend time pouring yourself into your children. You should live your life in such a way that when you leave this world, they will have great things to say about you.",

As they were cutting down trees, one of their axe heads fell into the river and sank. There seemed to be no way to bring it back, until they factored God into the equation. Elisha got up, cut a stick from a tree and threw it into the river. If you have done a little bit of science, you would know that sticks float but then this one had anointing and so as soon as it got into the river, it sank. When it reached the axe head, it transferred the anointing to it and the iron that had sunk floated back to the surface of the river. All these happened because with God, nothing is impossible.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, Abraham and Sarah were past child-bearing age. God visited them and while they were entertaining Him, He said Sarah would have a baby in 9 months’ time. The Bible says in verse 12 that Sarah laughed within her. I would have laughed out too because ordinarily, a 90-year-old woman would not have been able to bear a child. Moreover, would Sarah and her husband still have been intimate at that age? She denied laughing, but then the Lord said, “Well, I know you laughed; nine months from now, you will carry a baby whose name will be Laughter”. True to God’s word, in nine months’ time, Sarah was laughing because even though she was 90 years old, she had now become a mother.<br><br>There is nothing impossible for my God to do.

      "Some people query God for not answering their prayers because they have been praying for so long. This has made them conclude that God is not real. The problem however, is not with Him; after all, many other people receive answers to prayers from Him daily. If there is a problem at all, it is likely to be from the fellow who is praying. Isaiah 59:1-2 tells us that God can always hear us but our sins separate and hide our faces from Him. If He doesn’t hear your prayer at all, how is He going to answer? How can you continue in sin and expect grace to abound? The Bible’s response to that is, “God forbid” (Romans 6:1-2).<br><br>Some people sow in Church and get no harvest, then they turn around to say that God’s word is not true, whereas the issue may be that God rejected their offering because of their sins (Proverbs 15:8). He must first accept you before He can accept your offering.<br><br>A lady attended one of our programmes  because she had heard that Pastor Adeboye has a special anointing for making the barren fruitful after praying for them. She met with me and I prayed for her. While praying for her, I laid my hand upon her and she fell. When she came around, she rejoiced that she had fallen under the anointing and was sure her miracle was on the way. A year later, she came back with a query because she had not given birth. I was already thinking that maybe God wanted to give her a second touch when all of a sudden, I heard God say, “Ask her how many boyfriends she has”. If I hadn’t known the voice of God, I wouldn’t have asked because she was a highly placed person in the society. I managed to ask her and she said she had six boyfriends! I was shocked. How can you expect a baby from God when you are keeping six boyfriends apart from your husband? How would she have known the real father?<br><br>Many people want a miracle, whereas what they are really asking for is magic. God is Holy and He is a miracle worker, not a magician like the devil. Begin to live holy from today so that when you call on God, you can rest assured that He will answer you.",

For this series however, I’ll focus on the colours red, yellow, green and blue.<br><br>Red is the colour of danger. Hebrews 12:29 says that God is a Consuming Fire, meaning that God is indeed powerful and not someone to be toyed with. If you don’t believe me, ask Pharaoh. When you carry the light of God in you, you become a danger to the enemy. That is why 1 Chronicles 16:22 says, <i>“Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm”.</i><br><br>Red is also the colour of blood and Revelation12:11 says that the saints overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. There is so much power in the blood of the Lamb that you can use it to overcome Satan. The red in the light of God within you will make you dangerous and give you power to overcome the devil. Red also signifies the stop sign. When the traffic light goes red, you know you have to stop (Exodus 12:23). Once you are lit up by the light of God, when evil sees you, it will stop.<br><br>Some years ago, a woman came to me and said money kept disappearing from their house. Initially, she and her husband suspected each other of stealing the money until one day, they confronted each other and discovered that neither of them was the culprit. This meant they were in real trouble. I understood what was happening immediately, especially because the husband used to be deep in the occult before he became a Christian. I then told them that they should always cover their money with the blood of Jesus so that anytime the devil came to steal it, he would find the blood of Jesus covering it and leave. From that day on, they never lost anything again.<br><br>I decree today that you, your children and property are covered in the blood of the Lamb and from now, when death sees you, it will stop, in Jesus’ name.",

Yellow is the colour of the sun and one of the names of Jesus Christ is the Sun of righteousness (Malachi 4:2).The yellow that is embedded in the light of God in you brings healing with it.<br><br>Yellow, being the colour of the sun, also means that it is the colour of unlimited energy. When you carry this light of God within you, you enjoy the kind of energy that people can’t understand. This is because Isaiah 40:31 says that they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. When I was about to turn 70, I asked God if I could retire and He said, ‘No’. Then I thought I would rest for the whole year instead.

He got to London and worked as a waiter in a restaurant.  Life was very difficult for him but he held on to his faith. One day, he overheard a rich Arabian man grumbling to himself in Arabic. He asked the man what was wrong. The rich Arabian, who had come to London to buy houses had become frustrated about his failure due to his inability to speak English. The man, excited that he had found someone who understood both Arabic and English, asked the boy to be his interpreter and paid him one million pounds per day for three days.<br><br>Once you carry the light of God within you, you become a candidate for divine prosperity.

The Light that lives within you is the Vine you connect to so as to become fruitful (John 15:5). He gives you the ability to be fruitful even in situations where others have been barren. He said about those who are His children:<br><br><b>There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.</b><br>Exodus 23:2<br><br>Green is also the colour of power (Acts 1:8).  When you carry the Light within you, you will have the power of God operating through you. You need power to move forward. It is the engine inside a vehicle that determines how fast it can go. When the Light is within you, you have a very high level of power that makes you accelerate at an unusual speed. In other words, when you carry the Light, your promotion will be extra rapid. Believe me honestly, you can enjoy such great speed in your career that even you will be trembling at the thought of it.<br><br>One of my sons came to me once, saying he had a job interview and he wanted me to just speak a word over him. I said, “Go and the interview will go well.” He said, “Amen” and left. He returned the following day excited that not only did the interview go well but that he got the job (Deputy Managing Director) and the board asked him to resume the very next day. I congratulated him and he said, “No, speak another word”. I said, “Alright, the Almighty God who has given you the job will make your promotion rapid”. He went and then the following day, came again, trembling. “Daddy, I got to the place of work, and was told that after I left the previous day, their Managing Director resigned. There, on the spot, I was offered the role of Managing Director”. I congratulated him again and he said, “No Daddy, speak another word”. I then said, “The God who has begun a good work in you will perfect it”. He came back to testify the day after that his salary had been doubled.<br><br>I speak a word to you now: your promotion shall be rapid, in the mighty name of Jesus. ",

      "he colour blue is widely considered as the colour of love and it is one of the colours that can be seen in pure light. 1 John 4:8 says God is love. What does love do for you? The mere fact that you are associated with the love of God makes you more than a conqueror (Romans 8:37). Deuteronomy 28:1-7 tells us that you don’t even have to fight against your enemies if you have the Light inside you. It says if they rise against you, they will be smitten before your face. You don’t even have to lift your hands; you just watch as the Lord - your Lover, takes care of your enemies.<br><br>There was once a military ruler in Nigeria who wanted to convert to a civilian president. He consulted some of his occult people and they said that I would be a threat to his ambition. The military ruler decided to come and pick me up and in those days, whenever that happened, the person involved was not likely to return alive. Fortunately for me, one of my spiritual children working with an arm of the government caught whiff of the plan and alerted me that they were coming for me within the next two weeks. I did not tell my wife; I just went out that night on my normal prayer walk and my Lover spoke to me. That is one thing that love does; it enables you to hear secrets from God (John 13:21-26). God told me plainly not to worry and that I would even outlive the fellow. A few days later, at the Holy Ghost Service on the first Friday of June, I said to the congregation, “Greet one another and say, “Happy New Year”. They obeyed and indeed by Sunday, the nation experienced a new beginning. That military ruler became deceased and his successor  handed over to a democratically elected government. Love made me more than a conqueror.<br><br>When you combine all the seven colours that make up the rainbow, they give you the colour white which symbolises purity and holiness.

      "In 2 Kings 1:9-15, Elijah was sitting on a mountain top when a king sent 50 armed soldiers and a captain to arrest him. Elijah looked defenceless physically but when they tried to arrest him, he called fire down from heaven to roast all of them. When the king sent another 50 soldiers, they got roasted too. Thereafter, he sent another set of 50 soldiers and their captain. When they got to the mountain where Elijah was and saw the ashes of the two sets of soldiers that had been consumed by fire, the Bible says the captain fell on his knees and begged the man of God to spare him as he was only doing his job. The angel of God then spoke to Elijah and said, “You can go with him”. What made his case different? Honour. That is why he was able to succeed at what got the previous captains and soldiers roasted.<br><br>It doesn’t matter who you are; if you despise an anointed man or woman of God, if you mock him or her, you could pay dearly for it. In 2 Kings 2:23-24, you see what happened when some children started mocking Elisha; they ended up being eaten by bears. The anointing on a man or woman of God can work dangerously against anyone who despises him or her. Any true man or woman of God will tell you that as the anointing increases, he or she speaks less because whatever he or she says when angry can kill.<br><br>There was a man who decided to take over the Parish of The Redeemed Christian Church of God he was pastoring. When I heard the news I simply said, “I leave him to God”. The man held a crusade and on his way home, he got killed by armed robbers.  I had thought I was careful enough with what I said. Since then, I learned to not take offence easily and if at all I am offended, I keep my mouth shut. It is better to provoke a blessing from the anointed than a curse. The easiest way to provoke a man or woman of God to bless you is to honour him or her. When you honour the anointed, the anointing will work in your favour. The king of Israel honoured Elisha by calling him Father. In turn, Elisha used his anointing to save him and his army when their enemies laid ambush for them. God can solve all your problems in an instant if you would just honour a man or woman of God.",

      "The call of God is actually a call to God. Many people think that when God calls them, it is a call to something, whereas it is a call to Him. When He calls you, He is saying, “Come closer to me”. In Mark 3:14, the Bible says that the first reason He called the disciples was that they should be with Him.<br><br>The call of God is two-fold. First, He can call you to leave your sinful ways, to leave the kingdom of darkness and come to Him in the Kingdom of light. This is the call He made in Matthew 11:28: <i>“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”</i>. We will focus on this first call today.<br><br>This call is the very one that every human being will receive. When you are in a service and you hear the preacher making the altar call, it is actually God Himself calling out to sinners to leave their sinful ways and come to Him for salvation.<br><br>There was a very notorious young man who brought someone to Church with his motorcycle. He waited for a little while outside the Church and listened to the sermon. When the altar call was made he considered surrendering his life to Christ, but then decided against it and zoomed off. Unfortunately, he got involved in an accident later that day and died. If only he had answered the altar call when it was made! Even if he had still died, at least he would have made it to heaven.<br><br>God’s call unto salvation is extended to everyone. He desires to call all sinners out of darkness into His marvellous light. He is seeking to make everyone a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation and a peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9).<br><br>Some however, heed God’s call, become saved then start to sin again wilfully.  Such people are not fit for the kingdom of God (Luke 9:62) and He has promised to spue such out of His mouth if they do not retrace their steps back to Him. (Revelation 3:16). ",

For example, He can call some people to join Him in politics because He has an agenda to use the political office they will occupy as a tool in redeeming the world. <br>God is not a Sunday-Sunday God. He is God every single day.  Pastors don’t reserve the right to be used by God. As long as you are born again - whether you are in business, arts, entertainment or even fashion, God can use you in that field to redeem the world.

Note that you are His representative there and so must not do what He would not if He were there physically Himself.<br>As a reward for answering the call to join Him in His redemptive work in the world, God makes sure that all things work together for your good.<br><b>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</b><br>Romans 8:28<br>Once you are called according to His purpose and you answer that call, fulfilling His purpose in your field, all things will begin to work together for your good.",

      "Personality disorders are becoming more and more common, even amongst children of God. These disorders typically involve patterns of behaviour and thinking that usually makes it difficult to form and maintain a close relationship with God. They also make it difficult to meet the daily demands of one's personal, spiritual, and work life. Experts say that these personality disorders can be identified by three major characteristics: intense and unstable emotions, eccentric and odd behaviour or extreme fear and nervousness. Some studies have also shown that personality disorders are often associated with high levels of self-injury and are even sometimes linked to suicide. The situation is so bleak that Job 10:22 described it as, <i>“A land of ﻿darkness, as ﻿darkness itself; And of ﻿the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as ﻿darkness”</i>. I pray that you and your loved ones will never experience this, in Jesus’ name. If you are already experiencing this, may the power of God deliver you today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Several passages of the Bible confirm that spiritual personality disorder could come through three major sources: as an attack from the enemy (John 10:10), self-infliction (Mark 7:23, Galatians 5:21), or as a divine curse, a repercussion of sin, as recorded in 1 Corinthians 3:17. Deuteronomy 28:20, also says:<br><br><b>The Lord ﻿shall send upon thee cursing, ﻿vexation, and ﻿rebuke, in all ﻿that thou settest thine hand unto ﻿for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.</b><br><br>Repent of all your sins and accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. Jesus intervened and restored several cases of personality disorders and insanity to wholeness by His word. I therefore decree in the name that is above every other name: Be delivered from every spiritual personality disorder and insanity today, in the name of Jesus.",

      "Our memory verse for today says that fear is a tormentor. According to 2 Timothy 1:7, fear is a spirit and since it is not a gift from God, then it is from the devil. In Proverbs 29:25, God says the fear of man brings a snare. In other words, if you are afraid of a man, you will fall into a trap. The reason many people run to witch doctors is fear, which is why they keep looking for protection against all kinds of enemies.<br><br>One of the things that makes fear so terrible is that almost invariably, that which you are afraid of will come to you (Job 3:25). The fear of death has put many people in bondage today. The question now is: is everyone not going to die anyway? Hebrews 9:27 says death is an appointment that everyone must keep. The devil keeps people in bondage because of something that they should be prepared for rather than afraid of.<br><br>When you have God with you, fear will get away from you. David said that the reason he had no fear even in the valley of the shadow of death is because he had the presence of God with him (Psalm 23:4). Romans 8:15 says you do not have the spirit of bondage to fear, rather, that of adoption, giving you the right to call God your Daddy. The true realisation that you are a child of God and that God is with you always will chase fear out of your life. No child is afraid of a bully when his daddy is standing beside him. As long as you are a child of God who lives holy, you can be sure that God is with you always. Our Bible reading for today says you should not be afraid for God is with you, it says He will hold your hand and strengthen you. If you have God on your side, you have nothing to fear.<br><br>Draw close to God and He will draw close to you (James 4:8). This means that if you surrender your life to Jesus and begin to live a holy life, God will come close to you and fear will disappear from your life. Sin will create a gap between you and God as He won’t even hear the prayers of unrepentant sinners (John 9:31) not to talk of saving them from danger.<br>The only thing I fear is for God to leave me because if He does, I know that I am finished. That is why I live holy; I cannot afford to be away from His presence. What about you?",

      "Some people find it difficult to trust God. They would rather put their trust in things that they can see than in the Lord that they cannot see. Many times, it is because we feel we are intelligent and our intelligence has helped us in the past so we want to be able to use it for everything. I once went to minister the Holy Ghost baptism to a group of people; the uneducated ones were baptised almost as soon as the ministration started, but the educated ones were looking around, trying to understand how the baptism would come. These were doubting Thomases. Thomas was a man who would not believe until he saw with his eyes. John 20:29 says, <i>“Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”</i><br><br>Apostle Paul also said:<br><br><b>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal</b><br><br>. 2 Corinthians 4:18<br><br>Where you look to when you are in need of help is where your faith lies. For example, David said he would look up to the hills from whence came his help – the Lord (Psalm 121:1-2).  If you look to man, then your faith lies in man. If you look to your money, then that is where your faith lies. God can use either to meet your need, but you are to look to God and God alone. God is displeased when you have faith in anything or anyone else but Him. Hebrews 11:6 says without faith it is impossible to please God. Until you take your eyes off the physical and set them on Him in the Spirit, some things will remain out of your reach.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, Asa found it difficult to look to God for his healing even when physicians had failed him. This is a stronghold of the devil that must be broken. If you study your Bible diligently, pray without ceasing, and fellowship regularly with other believers, you would soon begin to see how the spiritual controls the physical.<br><br>Spend more time with God than you do with man and that stronghold of dependence on physical things will be broken.",

      "I grew up in a very poor home. My father was extremely poor, yet he had two wives and many children. He also had a small farm that could not support the family if he died.  So, I decided that I wasn’t going to die in that state of poverty and I knew that the only way out was to study hard in school. I studied hard and gained admission to Ilesha Grammar School but when the results came, my mother called me into the room and said, “You this boy, what are you trying to do? You know we have no money, and you say you want to go to Grammar School.” Then she begged me, “Please my boy, Christmas is coming, I will buy you good clothes. Forget about this Grammar School.” I told her, “I don’t want Christmas clothes. I want to go to school.” This was in 1955. To show her how serious I was, I refused to eat for two days and was prepared to continue my hunger strike on the third day when she and my father somehow got some money and deposited it to the school. One way or the other, I finished secondary school and gained admission into the university and today I am where I am.<br><br>Success does not come to people who consider their limitations before they move.<br><br><b>The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.</b><br>Psalm 26:13<br><br>No matter the odds against you, if you can ignore those odds and just set out, there is success waiting for you out there. See those things that you call limitations as tests challenging your abilities. A champion is rated by the opponent he faces, the bigger the opponent, the greater the title. The stronger the opposition you face; the greater your level of success. Most people know the heavyweight champion of the world, but if you are to ask around only a few know the lightweight champion.<br><br>The reason my success story is interesting to many is the low level I came from. Get up and face those limitations; the reward will be worthwhile.<br><br><b>Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</b><br><br>2 Chronicles 15:7",

      "Time is quite a difficult concept to define. One very simple way to describe it is that it is a river that constantly flows. It keeps flowing in a certain direction and carries everyone along with it. No matter what you are doing, time keeps flowing on. Therefore, when you don’t do what you are supposed to at the right time, not only would you have wasted a part of your time on earth, but a part of your life also.  This is why you cannot afford to be lazy.<br><br>One of the things you must understand about the river called time is that as it is carrying you on, it is constantly throwing opportunities at you. It carries you through these opportunities from the day you were born until the day you die. As you flow, you go from one place to another and come across one person or another.  Each person or place comes as an opportunity. If you don't grab it when you are there, you may miss it forever as the river doesn't flow backwards. When you understand this about time, you will realise that what decides if you will be successful is your ability to identify and make use of opportunities (Ecclesiastes 9:11).<br><br>The river called time has boundaries on both sides and you are usually in the middle. Occasionally, when God really loves you, He brings you in contact with the right person and tells you to follow him or her. If you are wise enough to obey Him without questions, then you will arrive at your God-ordained destiny. This is what happened to me when I met my Father-in-the-Lord – Pa Akindayomi. I had a Ph.D. in Mathematics which was a big deal back then. My Father-in-the-Lord could not even read or write. He could only read the Bible because of a God-given ability, yet God said I should submit to and follow him. Eventually, when he was going to be with the Lord, he wrote in his will that I should take over the leadership of the Church. My salary at the time was more than the income of the entire Church, but I obeyed. That is how the river of time brought me to where I am now.<br><br>If you want to fulfil your destiny, rely on God to show you the opportunities hidden in the people you meet and places you go, so that you will arrive at your expected end.",

      "Nehemiah 8:10 says the joy of the Lord is your strength. Joy produces strength and strength is the ability to do work. Joy is the energy drink that heaven gives you to keep you strong and healthy enough to work. The thing about this energy drink is that it has different concentrations, depending on how much of it is needed per time. The one with the smallest concentration is what I will call regular joy. You are supposed to have a dose of it every morning. Psalm 30:5 says weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. People who suffer depression find it difficult to even stand from their beds in the morning. If you are experiencing any form of depression or sadness, I pray that the Lord will fill you with joy and strengthen you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>One of the ways of getting joy is through hearing good news. Psalm 51:8 says, <i>“Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice”.</i><br><br>A brother returned from work so tired he refused dinner and just went to bed. As soon as he got to his room, his fiancée came to visit.  His mother welcomed her but said the brother was very tired and had gone to bed. However, the brother heard his fiancée’s voice and rushed out. He went to his mother and asked what he could offer the young lady. She replied, “There is rice but you will have to cook it”. He said, “No problem, I will cook”. The mother looked at him with surprise, wondering how he who had been too tired to even eat was now ready to cook.  The good news that his fiancée was around had given him strength that even he did not know he had. You will hear good news every morning, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The word of God is good news, it gives joy. Study it every morning; you will experience joy and receive strength. Jeremiah 15:16 says, “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.”<br><br>Before you read the newspapers or blogs where you will most likely hear bad news, read the word of God to get the good news you need to strengthen you for the day.",

      "There is yet a more concentrated type of energy drink that comes from heaven to man, called ‘Great Joy’. Luke 2:8-16 tells of how the angels, at the birth of Jesus Christ, told the Shepherds that they had brought good news of great joy. Nehemiah 8:10 says the joy of the Lord shall be your strength. When you have great joy, you will be able to do anything your heart desires for God.<br><br>When we started building the camp, because of the great joy of having our own campground at last, we did things that people would consider impossible – like building and completing a house and then furnishing it within seven days! As the Lord lives, you will experience great joy today, in Jesus’ name. <br><br>Now, what are the things that can bring you great joy? 3 John 1:4 says, <i>“I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.”</i> You experience great joy when you are making disciples for Christ, when you are seeing people being saved from the horrors of darkness into the light of God. In the example I gave above where we built a house in seven days, we were not joyful because we now had a place to sleep, but rather because we now had a bigger platform through which we could win more souls to Christ. If you have not been winning souls to Christ, you don’t know what joy you have been missing. Jesus said there is joy in heaven whenever one sinner repents (Luke 15:7). So, if God wins a soul through you, and there is rejoicing in heaven, don’t you think that you would also be a partaker of that joy?<br><br>This great joy is majorly fuelled by the knowledge of how much Jesus loves us. Philemon 1:7 says there is great joy in love. When we consider how much God’s love has done for us, we are strengthened to do anything just to make sure that His will is done on earth. He has no greater need than for souls to be saved. ",

      "Beyond great joy, there is a higher concentration of this energy drink which is called ‘Exceeding Great Joy’. In our Bible reading for today, when the wise men who had been traveling a long way, looking for the new born King  saw the star again, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. They continued on their journey as if they had just started. Exceeding great joy gives you the ability to go the extra mile, to do exceeding great things that ordinary people cannot do.<br><br>This exceeding great joy comes from the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). When you get this concentration of joy, people will assume that you are drunk. Imagine seeing two people asking a man who has been lame all his life to stand and walk. That doesn’t make any sense, but it is only possible when you are filled with the Holy Ghost.<br><br>One unique thing about this concentration of joy is that as you utilise it, you get even more of it. If you have ever seen someone who the doctors say has only a few more weeks to live and you pray for the fellow, then he or she gets healed and lives for many more decades after that, you would get a new rush of exceeding great joy. Your faith would increase and you would be empowered to do more. There are so many people who are filled with the Holy Ghost but never pray for the sick or try to perform any miracle. Once, when I was crying to God to empower me to work miracles, He told me, “Keep quiet. Have you used the power that I have given you?” I said, “What power?” He answered, “Are you baptised in the Holy Ghost?” I said, “Yes”. He responded, “What does Acts 1:8 say?” I knew what it says, but then I didn’t feel like I had received any power so I responded, “But, I don’t feel powerful” to which He replied, “Did I say the just shall live by feelings or by faith?”<br><br>The day after this conversation, a woman brought her dying child who had not slept for days, to me for prayers. I remembered my conversation with God, so I prayed for the child. After praying, I opened my eyes to see that the child had fallen asleep. When he woke up, he was completely fine. That boosted my faith and filled my heart with exceeding great joy. I am grateful that He is still filling me with exceeding great joy and working many great miracles through me.  He can do the same for you if you surrender all to Him.",

Joy unspeakable enables you to do miracles that even you will think you are dreaming when you remember them. Psalm 126:1 says, <i>“When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream”.</i><br><br>Joy unspeakable gives you the ability to do the kind of miracles that you will find difficult to share with people, as they may not be able to believe them.<br><br>I had an experience that took me years before I could share. I had gone out on a prayer walk in the middle of the night - deep into the bush where I could be alone to pray. I had my torch with me, but after praying for some time, the battery died and I needed to find my way out in that darkness. I then remembered something I was taught in primary school: that if the room is dark and you close your eyes for a while then open them, the place will look brighter. I closed my eyes for a while and then opened them. When I opened my eyes, the moon was shining so bright; everywhere was as bright as day. I walked out of the bush to the main road, then looked up again and didn’t see the moon. I know you probably don’t believe me, but it happened.<br><br>There was a young man whose aunty died and then was embalmed. He was working in Lagos and it took eleven days before he could get permission from work to go home. He got home, entered the room where the woman was laid, carrying the deceased’s little child. He took a handkerchief that we had anointed at one of our programmes and laid it on the corpse. He prayed, but then nothing happened. He wasn’t really expecting anything to happen anyway, he was just trying his faith. Sad, he turned to leave the room. As he got to the door, he heard a sound behind him. On looking back, he discovered that his aunt who had been dead for eleven days was sitting upright. When he shared the testimony, a lot of people didn’t believe, but it was true.<br><br>I have good news for you: My Daddy will fill your life with mighty testimonies and unspeakable joy in the mighty name of Jesus.",

      "When God steps into the situation of a man, we call it a divine encounter. A divine encounter is actually a collision between God - with His supernatural powers and human beings - with their helplessness. In Luke 7:11-15, a widow – on her way to bury her only son met Jesus – in whose presence is fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11). The result was a collision that caused joy to swallow up sorrow. The widow’s sorrow ended and she returned home rejoicing. The Almighty God is going to collide with you today and you will experience a great transformation, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>During one of our programmes some years ago, the Lord gave me a revelation for someone in the meeting and I announced: “The Lord said there is someone here who should have been married but the mother says she would not get married. If the mother does not repent, she will be dead within a week”. A lady that was of a marriageable age believed the word was for her and she went home to tell her mother. The next day, the mother, furious, came with her to see me, saying, “My daughter came and informed me that you said I will die within a week”. I told her exactly what God had said, explaining that I hadn’t mentioned any name. After this, she asked the girl to leave the office, then turned to me, “It is not that I don’t want her to marry. It’s just that she is the one taking care of me. Once she marries, there will be no one to take care of me”. I replied, “That is not a problem; I will talk to the husband and they will continue to take care of you”. The mother then said, “In that case, she can marry”. Six months later, the daughter was married.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, we saw how God stepped into the situation of the Israelites and brought doom upon the Egyptians. This tells us that we must be careful when dealing with children of God because Jesus can decide to step into the situation at any time. When He decides to step into a situation, you had better be sure that you are on His side. If you surrender to Him willingly, then He will collide with all the forces against you but if you are not on His side, a collision with Him will bring about a negative result like it did for the Egyptians.",

      "The greatest experiences a man can have in life are drawn from the moments he spends alone with God. Those are times when destinies are shaped. If you look through the Scriptures and study people who achieved great feats for God, you will notice that all of them spent quality time alone with God. In Exodus 24:18, Moses had been on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights spending time alone with God. No wonder he is the only man who ever saw God. After seeing the back of God in Exodus 33:23, the Bible says the glory that shone on his face was so bright that people could not look at him. That is what happens when you spend time with God: His glory rubs off on you and it is evident to everyone around you.<br><br>Many times when the Bible talks about Elijah, he was on the mountain top. You go to the mountain top because you want to get away from where people are so that you can be alone with God. What was the result of Elijah’s constant fellowship with God? He could call down fire from heaven anytime he wanted. He was also the first prophet to ever bring the dead back to life. It is in those times that you spend with God that He enlarges your capacity to do greater things than you used to. Joseph was a very busy man in Potiphar’s house, overseeing his master’s many great possessions. All that time that he was busy, he didn’t grow beyond being a dreamer. When he was locked up in prison however, he had time to be alone with God and grew from being a dreamer to becoming an interpreter of dreams.<br><br>Your greatest potential will only be realised when you spend quality time alone with God. During Jesus’ earthly ministry, He never joked with His quiet time (Luke 6:12,21:37).<br><br>No wonder He was able to fulfil His destiny as tough as it was. Be intentional about spending quality time with God – praising Him, praying, fasting, studying and meditating on His word.

      "Spiritual Superiority is what can make you deal with your enemies so completely that you make a mockery of them. That is what happened in Colossians 2:15 which says, <i>“And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.”</i> <br><br>2 Kings 6:8-20 tells us that a king considered Elisha as a threat, so he sent an entire army to arrest him. This however turned out to be an impossible mission because Elisha demonstrated spiritual superiority by arresting the entire army when they got to his place. As if that was not enough, he also led them as captives into their enemy’s territory.<br><br>When God sees a man or woman who is committed to a life of holiness, He will use that fellow to make an open shame of the enemy and  arrest arresters. If you get really close to God, you won’t pray for your enemies to be destroyed because the Bible says in Psalm 23:5:<br><br><b>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</b><br><br>If all enemies are dead, who will behold your glory? I am praying for you that God will take you to such a level that in the very presence of your enemies, He will be glorified in you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Your ability to exhibit spiritual superiority over the devil happens when you become really close to God. How close do you want to be to God – the Consuming Fire? The elders say that when a leaf stays long with the soap, it will become soap. If you stay sufficiently close to the Consuming Fire, you too will become a consuming fire. If you really want to be able to put your enemies to shame, then you need to get close to the Consuming Fire. The price to pay for this is complete holiness and constant fellowship with God. Fasting and prayers must be your lifestyle.<br><br>Without holiness, you cannot even have access to the Lord, talk less of being close to Him. Live holy and you will see the enemy begging you to release them after you have arrested them.",

      "In 1 Kings 3:4, Solomon decided to give God a really special offering. He sacrificed 1,000 cattle. The priests must have been very surprised, but then Solomon considered the circumstances behind his birth and felt unworthy to be king. Ordinarily, Solomon should have been hated by all, but there he was, the one chosen to be king. He knew he did not deserve what he had received from God so he spared nothing when it came to thanking Him.<br><br>Many a time, you don’t thank God enough  because you think you deserve all that He has given you, but if you look closely, you would see that you are wrong. The day God pointed out to me that because I am not a child from the first wife of my father, I ought not to be used by Him according to the law, but that His mercy had found me usable, I became more humble in my thanksgiving. Isaiah 64:6 says:<br><br><b>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</b> <br><br>If you think your blessings are a result of your hard work, you should go and see some people who are working far harder than you, yet are not rich. If you think your success thus far is based on how smart you are, you need to go to the asylum and  see many brilliant people who have lost their minds. The fact that you can even wake up in the morning is enough reason to give thanks to God. Psalm 3:5 says, <i>“I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD  sustained me.”</i><br><br>If you think deeply, you will see that you don’t deserve any of the things that God has given to you. You will see that it is in Him that you live and move and even have your being (Acts 17:28). You will see that without Him, you can do nothing (John 15:5). I don’t know about you, but as for me, I know that I would have been long gone if it wasn’t for Him. I know that everything I am is as a result of His tender mercies towards me, so I will praise Him with all my heart. I will never hold back anything in giving Him thanks.",

      "When you ask people who or what they worship, they are most likely to tell you ‘God’, but then, many people are worshipping other things or persons apart from God. Some people worship their spouses, children, money, some their bellies, some their image on social media and, believe it or not, some worship their means of transportation. When I was in the grammar school, we had a teacher who had a bicycle that he loved so much. Whenever he got to a place that was muddy, he would get down from the bicycle and carry it across. He preferred for his feet to get dirty than his bicycle. He worshipped his bicycle.<br><br>Many come to God in prayers and get nothing from Him because He can see in their heart that there is an idol there. He knows that they only worship Him with their mouths, that their hearts are far from Him (Matthew 15:8). Since He is not their God, then He ignores them. If at all the Lord answers, He does so according to the idols in their hearts.<br><br><b>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the  LORD  will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols.</b><br><br>Ezekiel 14:4<br><br>In Numbers 22:19-35, Balaam valued the treasures that the king promised him more than the instruction of God. After God had told him not to heed the king’s call, he still went back to God when the servants came back to ask if he should go, so God answered him according to the idol in his heart, telling him to go. On his way, there was an angel waiting to kill him. Had it not been for the eyes of his donkey that were opened to see the angel, he would have been dead as a result of the idol of greed in his heart.<br><br>Our God is a jealous God. He said in Exodus 34:14, <i>“For thou shalt worship no other god: for the  LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God”.</i>The moment you regard anyone or anything above God, He will leave you alone and believe me honestly, the worst thing that can ever happen to a person is for God to leave him or her.",

      "The Bible tells us in Psalm 100:4 that the entrance into God’s presence has a gate. When you see a gate in a place, you know it is there is so as to restrict access. Whatever is inside the place must be so valuable that they don’t want any unauthorised person to have access to it. There are many treasures in the presence of God and not just anybody can enjoy them. One of such treasures is fullness of joy (Psalm 16:11) and liberty (2 Corinthians 3:17). Anyone who has entered the presence of God will tell you that it is a place that you don’t want to ever come out from. In 2 Corinthians 5:8, Apostle Paul said, <i>“We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.”</i><br><br>The first criterion for accessing God’s presence is holiness. God cannot stand sin. If you have any form of sin in your life, the gate into His presence will be shut against you. Psalm 24:3-4 says:<br><br><b>Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</b><br><br>Only those with clean hands and a pure heart can be allowed to ascend into the presence of the Lord. If your hands have been soiled with sin, forget about it. If your heart is not pure, if you  habour impure thoughts in that heart, the gate into God’s presence will be shut against you.<br><br><b>Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the  LORD: This gate of the  LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</b><br>Psalm 118:19<br><br>The gates into the presence of God are called the gates of righteousness; if you are not righteous, you cannot go through. The One whose presence you want to enter is a holy God; you must be holy before you can get in there. Joseph had to shave and change his clothes before appearing before Pharaoh (Genesis 41:14); how much more when you want to enter the presence of the King of kings.",

      "Yesterday we identified righteousness as a precondition to access God’s presence. Once a person has clean hands and a pure heart, he or she would be able to access God’s presence with thanksgiving and praises as stated in Psalm 100:4:<br><br><b>Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.</b><br><br>If you try to get into His presence with complaints or even requests, the gate will not be opened to you. Only those who approach Him with thanksgiving are attended to. However, your thanksgiving will get you into His gates, but your praises will get you into His courts. Being in His courts is definitely a step higher than just getting into the gates. The keepers of the gates always check for how well you can praise God before they admit you in. If they see that you are not one who is willing to praise God, they will lock you out. David seemed to be talking to the keepers of the gate when he said in Psalm 118:19, <i>“Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the  LORD:”</i><br><br>It is as though God had instructed them thus: “If anyone comes here with complaints or requests without thanksgiving or praise, don’t open this gate for the fellow”. That is why when Jesus was teaching us to pray in Luke 11:1-4, He said we are to start with, “Our Father who hath in heaven, hallowed be thy name”. If you start your prayers that way, you are guaranteed access to the presence of God, where you can then present your requests.<br><br><b>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</b><br>John 4:23<br><br>Since the Father seeks true worshippers, it means that whenever you worship Him, you draw down His presence to wherever you are. Psalm 22:3 says that He inhabits the praises of His children. You won’t have to struggle to get into His presence again, if you would just fill your heart with thanksgiving and praise.",

    bodyText:
      "The kind of help anyone can render is determined either by the person’s might or capability. Nobody can give what he or she does not have. This makes divine help very desirable since it comes from the unlimited God. David knew this secret and penned what we have as part of our text for today.  He said, <i>“I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth”</i> (Psalm 121:1-2). The following are the steps we must take to secure divine help:<br><br>First, we must fear and trust the One who has unlimited power to help. Psalm 37:39-40 says that the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord and that He shall help and deliver them from the wicked because they trust Him. The second step is to keep the law of the Lord. Psalm 119:145-146 says: <i>“I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord: I will keep thy statutes.  I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.”</i> Unfortunately, many self-professing Christians do not want to hear anything about the law of God and would rather overstretch the place of grace to the point of lawlessness.  This is not God’s will.<br><br>The third step for those who would benefit from Divine help is to call on the Lord for the needed help. The Bible says in Exodus 20:3: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Looking up to anything or anyone apart from God is idolatry. This is dangerous because our God is a jealous God (Exodus 20:5).  As a matter of fact, we short-change ourselves by trusting in man that is limited rather than trusting the Almighty, the Unlimited God.  The Bible says:<br><br><b>Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horse, because they are strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord.</b><br>Isaiah 31:1.<br><br>Beloved, I encourage you to surrender your life to Jesus, live righteously and look up to God alone for help. He will never let you down. ",

      "Divine help is comforting and assuring. It is however, not for everybody.  Unless God is your Father, you may not be able to access divine help. In our Bible reading today, Jesus told the woman seeking His help that divine healing is reserved only for God’s children, so she was disqualified. Her faith in Jesus Christ however, eventually qualified her for divine help. <br><br>Therefore, you should ask yourself, “Am I a child of God?” “Have I surrendered all to the Lord Jesus?” Placing all your faith in Jesus and surrendering your life to Him is the only way to access God and divine help (John 14:6). <br><br>Another vital requirement to access divine help is knowing exactly what you need help with. The woman in our Bible reading today was very clear about what she wanted, and she got it as she persisted in her request, with all her faith in Christ Jesus. Bartimaeus is also an excellent example of someone who knew what he wanted God to do for him and got the divine help he sought (Mark 10:46-52). <br><br>It is also important to know where to seek for help. Beloved, where are you seeking help from? Many people seek help from different sources – man, rivers, mountains and so on. Everyone seeking help from other sources apart from the Almighty God will only have their sorrows multiplied as we see in Psalm 16:4.<br><br>You may be asking, “How do I seek divine help?”  Jesus said: <i>“Ask, and it shall be given you…”</i> (Matthew 7:7). When asking the Lord for help however, don’t ask for things He has already empowered you to do yourself. For example, when God provides a job, don’t go to sleep and expect Him to do the work for you!  There are however, many things that are beyond human capacity and the good news is that nothing is beyond God’s capacity. Ask Him for help with those things that no man can do for you. For example, only God can cause a woman without a womb to conceive and bring forth a set of twins. That was the testimony of a sister some years ago and I pray you will also experience unbelievable miracles, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Beloved, if you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, you have His open invitation to ask for everything you want in faith and He will do them for you according to His will.<br><br>",

      "<b>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</b><br>Revelation 4:11 <br><br>The verse above clearly states that the Creator made all things for His pleasure. For example, in our Bible reading for today, we see God feeding Elijah so that he would have the required strength to fulfill the divine mission set before him.  The angel of the Lord said to him, <i>“Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.”</i> That meal gave him the strength he needed for forty days and forty nights as he travelled to Horeb, the mountain of God (1 Kings 19:7-8). <br><br>Many people however, want divine help for selfish reasons. Some of them are not even born again; yet they are asking for miracles. Such people fail to realise that the Almighty God is a prudent investor and He will not invest in a project that will not promote His Kingdom. For example, God needed a prophet so when Hannah asked for a son and promised to give him back to God, the Lord granted her request (1 Samuel 1).<br><br>Jesus said in Matthew 7:6: <br><b>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</b><br><br>The verse above implies that God will not give that which is holy to someone who is still living in sin. You cannot remain in the kingdom of darkness or be toying with sin as a Christian and expect God to help you. <br><br>Beloved, if you desire divine help, surrender your life to Jesus Christ and be determined to do only things that will give Him pleasure. Be committed to showing forth the praises of He who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9) and He will help you. ",

      "Divine blessing can be described as a command from God that will make all the forces in heaven, on earth and under the earth favour an individual or group of people. A divinely blessed person or group of people will succeed where others are failing. For example, in our Bible reading today, Isaac sowed during a famine and he reaped a hundredfold. In other words, he succeeded where others were failing. We can trace this remarkable result to God’s blessing over Abraham, Isaac’s father in Genesis 22:17: <br><br><b>That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</b><br><br>God had promised to bless Abraham and multiply his seed after he passed the test in Genesis 22. Little wonder why Isaac would sow and reap a hundredfold during a famine. <>brIsaac however, also had a part to play in obtaining and enforcing the fulfilment of the divine blessing on his life. Firstly, he was obedient to his father even up to the point of death. Isaac could have escaped easily from Abraham when the latter laid him on the altar, but he did not. That must have really pleased God. Secondly, he obeyed God’s instruction to stay at Gerar even when humanly speaking, it did not appear to be the right thing to do at the time, considering the famine in the land. <br><br>Only those who are obedient to divine instructions will experience divine blessings. Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, told the maidens that whatever Jesus asked them to do, they should do it and their obedience led to the divine provision of much better wine for the guests at the wedding (John 2:5-10).<br><br>Beloved, divine blessing is sweet, pleasant and without sorrow. Surrender your life to Jesus Christ, live in complete obedience to God and you will experience divine blessings in every area of your life, in Jesus’ name.  ",

      "It is one thing to receive divine blessings and quite another to keep them. I always teach my children in the faith that the grace needed to receive a miracle is not as great as the one needed to keep it. God has no problem blessing His people, but keeping the blessing is a responsibility many people fail to live up to. Today we will be looking at how to retain divine blessings.<br><br>The first thing one must do is to stay connected to the source of divine blessings - God. A branch will remain fruitful as long as it remains connected to the vine, and of course will become fruitless the moment it disconnects from its source of fruitfulness. Jesus is the vine and we His disciples are His branches. Without Him we can do nothing (John 15:5). <br><br>Secondly, to stay connected to the source of divine blessings, you must be holy. Sin causes a separation between the sinner and God (Isaiah 59:2). If God will not listen to a sinner, how then will such a fellow receive and retain divine blessings? The Almighty told Abraham this secret in Genesis 17: 1-2: <br><br><b>And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceeding.</b><br><br>According to our Bible reading of today, after Jesus had healed a man of a thirty-eight-year old sickness, He warned him to stay away from sin so he would not experience something even worse. <br><br>Finally, you must acknowledge that all you have is from God and always return all the glory to Him with thanksgiving. For example, Nebuchadnezzar failed to acknowledge that God was his source and he lost all he had. God however, restored all Nebuchadnezzar lost when the latter realised that he was nothing without  God (Daniel 4:30-37).<br><br>I pray you will never lose your God-given blessings, in Jesus’ name.

      "Many divine blessings are conditional.  This is why there are many “ifs” in God’s covenants with mankind. For instance, in Deuteronomy 28:1 God promised the children of Israel that He would bless them so much so that they would be above all nations of the earth, if they would hearken diligently to His voice and keep His commandments. <br><br>The primary purpose of divine blessings is to make the blessed fellow fruitful and a blessing to others. Fruitfulness however, is also one of the conditional blessings of God. The primary condition for fruitfulness is found in John 15:4:<br><br><b>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</b><br><br>The question then is, “How can I abide in the Vine?” The answer is not far-fetched. You must first become a part of the Vine by responding positively to Jesus’ call in Matthew 11:28-30. When you confess Him as your Lord and saviour, you become grafted into the Vine – the Lord Jesus Christ. <br><br>The next phase is to abide in Jesus. Abiding in Jesus means living according to His will. Jesus said in John 8:31, <i>“…if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed”.</i> He also said in John 15:10, <i>“If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love”.</i><br><br>You can be fruitful spiritually, like Peter who preached one sermon and 3000 souls were won into the kingdom of God (Acts 2:38-41) or Paul, who God healed many sick people through his apron and handkerchiefs (Acts 19:11-12).  You can also be fruitful materially, as in the case of Isaac, who became so wealthy that a whole nation began to envy him (Genesis 26:14-17). Furthermore, you can also be fruitful physically such that in your old age, you would remain strong, as in the case of Moses (Deuteronomy 34:7).<br><br>Beloved, as we read in our Bible text today, it is dangerous to be unfruitful. You will experience all-round fruitfulness if you surrender your life to Jesus and live according to His will for the rest of your life.",

For anyone to have the hope of glory, the fellow must choose correctly whom he or she would serve (Joshua 24:15). It takes faith to choose rightly, according to our memory verse for today.<br><br>Through faith in the Living God, we are justified as the redeemed of the Lord – Jesus being the Author and Finisher of our Faith. He came to save us through His death, by the washing away of our sins with His blood. This is why the Bible says:<br><br><b>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. But now is Christ from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</b><br>1 Corinthians 15:13-14, 20 <br><br>The Scripture above is the basis for our hope of glory. The Scripture further says, <i>“if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable”</i> (1 Corinthians 15:19). This is why as Christians, we should not despair even in tribulation because of the assurance of glory we have in Christ. <br><br>Our hope of glory is not an empty hope, according to Revelation 21:1-7, which assures us of a new heaven and a new earth where there shall be no more pain, sorrow, lack, sickness or death. Death shall be swallowed in victory (1 Corinthians 15:54). <br><br>Therefore, beloved, to have this hope in you, accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour today. If you have accepted Christ, ensure you do not look back because Jesus said: <i>“No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God”</i> (Luke 9:62). <br><br>I pray the Almighty God keeps us all in Him to the end, in Jesus’ name.

However, the word of God cannot be understood through logical reasoning. For instance, Jesus preached that whoever will have his life must first lose it for His sake (Mark 8:35). He also declared that for us to find rest for our souls, we must take His yoke upon us. How can yoke-carrying bring rest to the soul of the carrier? This is why many scientists and philosophers struggle to accept and believe the word of God.

Rather, we want to see why divine intervention is necessary in the affairs of men. For example, when the children of Israel found themselves in slavery, they cried to the God of their fathers.<br><br><b>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</b><br>Exodus 3:9.<br><br>In response to their cry, there was a divine intervention which delivered them from slavery to King Pharaoh (Exodus 6:6).  This type of situation is not peculiar to the children of Israel alone; people have been subjected to serious attacks, frustration and untold hardship from generation to generation. The reason is found in the book of Revelation - how the devil came to the world in a great fury to wreak havoc on earth’s inhabitants (Revelation 12:12). Unless  God intervenes as He did in Genesis, human life can be extremely miserable. In today’s text, three kings ganged up against the tribe of Judah.  Jehoshaphat - the King of Judah, however, cried to the Lord for divine intervention, knowing that there was no way he could win the battle against just one of the three kings, not to mention the joint forces of all three. The Lord responded and said:<br><br><b>Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the Lord will be with you.</b><br><br>2 Chronicles 20:17<br><br>The Lord intervened and the battle was decided in favour of King Jehoshaphat and his people.

      "It is a fact that every human being, no matter how intelligent or highly placed, would at one time or the other require assistance to deal with some circumstances. Such a situation that renders a person of great means incapacitated is usually the type that money, authority and influence cannot resolve. At such times, the person is left with the option of calling for divine intervention through desperate prayers to the Almighty God. I pray that as you call on the name of the Lord in the day of trouble, He will answer you by fire, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>If you want your prayers to be answered however, you have a responsibility to the poor and needy around you. Our memory verse for today says as we have opportunity, we should be a blessing to all human beings, especially those of the household of faith. Anyone who heartlessly disregards the needs of the weak and helpless is wicked. Such will be ignored in the day of trouble, no matter how desperately they cry for help (Proverbs 21:13).<br><br>The point of today’s devotional is that we have a responsibility to care for the needy around us. When was the last time you helped the needy around you? When was the last time you made sacrifices in order to meet the needs of other people? Remember, the Bible cited the care for others as one of the conditions for making heaven as we saw in our Bible reading today.  Our Lord Jesus described how His followers who feed the hungry, are hospitable to strangers, clothe the naked, care for the sick, and visit prisoners will be blessed by God and granted eternal life. He went further to say that in as much as these good deeds are done to any of His brethren, it is considered that the acts were done to Him directly and vice versa.<br><br>All believers and the Church as a whole must not leave the poor and needy at the mercy of the government. The Body of Christ must not fail in our responsibility to care for the less privileged among us. Remember, if you know how to do good but do not do it, it would be counted unto you as a sin (James 4:20).",

      "For the next three days, we shall be looking at the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. Today we will consider His role as a Witness to Jesus Christ our Redeemer.<br><br>A very important role of the Holy Spirit is the conviction of sin, as we saw in today’s Bible text.  It reads in part:<br><br><b>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.</b><br>John 16:8 <br><br>Unfortunately, many people choose to be just spectators and merely watch the Holy Spirit in action – doing what only He can do, but are never partakers of it. Such people seldom allow the Holy Spirit to play His primary role of bringing them to repentance as they refuse to be remorseful for their sins. When people refuse to be convicted of their sins, they demonstrate a lack of faith in God’s word, which says all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 3:23). Such people rationalize sin and call it all sorts of nice names. This is why the Bible encourages us to confess our sins, even to one another, that we may be healed (James 5:16).<br><br>The first thing Jesus takes care of in the life of whoever He wants to heal is the issue of sin, according to Mark 2:5-12. Even after Jesus had healed an individual and found him in the temple some days later, His admonition was <i>“…sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee”</i> (John 5:14).<br><br>Beloved, if you have not yet confessed and forsaken your sins, allow the Holy Spirit to convict you of them. Begin to pay close attention to the details of God’s requirements for holy living and you would see the Holy Spirit transforming your life far beyond all expectations.   ",

      "We started to look at the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian yesterday. We discovered that the Holy Spirit convicts sinners of their sins and draws them unto repentance. Today we want to look at how the Holy Spirit helps believers pray.<br><br>When the Bible says that we should pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17), how can this be possible, humanly speaking? Clearly, this can only be possible with the help of the Holy Spirit.  This is why I pity those who deny the baptism of the Holy Spirit as promised by our Lord Jesus Christ in Acts 1:8.<br><br>Our Lord Jesus Christ gave a parable to teach us how important ceaseless prayer is to us as believers in Luke 18:1-8. However, without the help of the Holy Spirit, no one can accomplish this.<br><br>Naturally, we do not even know what to pray for but the Holy Spirit guides us and prays the will of God through us. Romans 8:26 says:<br><br> <b>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</b><br><br>From the scripture above, we see that we need the Holy Spirit to help us to pray the right way.<br><br>The Holy Spirit also reminds us of the significance of giving thanks as we pray. Indeed, our thanksgiving, praise and worship should always exceed our requests. Philippians 4:6 says:<br><br><b>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God.</b><br><br>These indeed are keys to get our prayers answered hence all Christians must seek to be baptised in the Holy Spirit.

      "Our memory verse of today reveals another very important role of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer – preserving us unto the day of redemption. ‘The day of redemption’ in the memory verse is talking of the ultimate redemption when we safely arrive in the Kingdom of God. The reason is that there is no eternal assurance that once you are saved, you are forever saved. There are examples of people who started well but ended badly. For instance, after King Saul was ordained by Samuel, he prophesied and the people asked: <i>“Is Saul also among the prophets?”</i> (1 Samuel 10:11). Unfortunately, after King Saul got into trouble for disobeying divine instructions, he went after a familiar spirit. 1 Samuel 28:7 says:<br><br><b>Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</b><br><br>King Saul did this despite the fact that the Bible says in Isaiah 65:24:<br><br><b>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</b><br><br>In John 16:7-14, we see that the Holy Spirit guides us into all - not some - truth.  Many things we ought to know about God, our Saviour, ourselves, the written word of God, the devil, and the world in which we live and so on are explained to us by the Holy Spirit.  We cannot gain an understanding of God without the Holy Spirit. The word of God would be ordinary literature without the Holy Spirit’s illumination.<br><br>The Bible says in John 16:13 that the Holy Spirit will show us things to come.<br><br>The spiritual decadence in the end-time Church has been foretold by the Holy Spirit (1 Timothy 4:1-2).  It is a pity, however, that some children of God are not taking advantage of the Holy Spirit’s guidance to keep us from falling. May you not fall, in Jesus’ name.  ",

      "What is a storm? Literally, a storm is a disturbance of the atmosphere marked by wind and some or a combination of the following: rain, snow, hail, sleet, or thunder and lightning. Figuratively however, a storm is a set of unpleasant circumstances that could result in some loss or the other. Storms of life are in categories. They could be physical, spiritual, emotional, financial, material, political etc.<br><br>In our text, we read about the rising of a great storm that could have capsised the boat Jesus and His disciples were sailing in. The Storm Stiller however, commanded that the storm should be still and it was so. Today, we shall look at physical storms in terms of ill-health. I pray that any storm of ill-health you may be battling is stilled now, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>In the story behind our memory verse of today, there was a man who suffered ill-health for thirty-eight years. His physical storm raged so long that he felt he was to die by the pool of Bethesda. However, on that very day that he encountered the Storm Stiller, his story changed. Jesus Christ – the Storm Stiller asked him: <i>“Wilt thou be made whole?” (John 5:6).</i><br><br>The Almighty God is asking you today, “Do you want to be healed?”  If your answer is “Yes,” then you must fulfil the condition for healing. Divine healing is the ‘food’ meant for children according to Matthew 15:26. Therefore, you must be sure you are genuinely born again because your sins must be forgiven before you can enjoy this divine blessing that will still your storm of ill-health. When Jesus Christ wanted to still the storm of the young man that was suffering terribly from palsy, the Bible says:<br><br><b>And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy: Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</b><br>Matthew 9:2<br><br>This implies that you should repent of your sins and seek God’s forgiveness if you want Him to still the storm of ill health in your life. As you heed His call today, every storm of ill health in your life will cease today, in Jesus’ name. ",

      "A financial storm is another critical storm of life that every believer must take care of by the power in the name of Jesus Christ. The Bible says: <i>“The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender”</i> (Proverbs 22:7). The Scripture further says: <i>“The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty”</i> (Proverbs 10:15). The first thing to do to still a financial storm is to work hard. The Bible says:<br><br><b>He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth  in harvest is a son that causeth shame.</b><br>Proverbs 10:4-5<br><br>The Bible further says in Proverbs 22:29:<br><br><b>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.</b><br><br>Thus, hard work is good. However, hard work alone may not guarantee safety from a financial storm because the Bible says: <i>“Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain”</i> (Psalm 127:1). Right from the fall at Eden, man has been labouring with little reward (Genesis 3:17-19). Therefore, the curse of poverty must be broken and the only One who can do this is Jesus Christ our Redeemer.<br><br>Our memory verse for today shows that Jesus sacrificed everything to restore man to a life of bliss. We must invite Him into our lives so that every financial storm blowing against our lives would be stilled.<br><br>We need to cry to God in the name of Jesus Christ, who promised that whatever we ask the Father in His name shall be done for us (John 14:14). He says also in Matthew 7:7-8, <i>“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened”.</i> God will end poverty in your life today and He will use your testimony to draw many into His Kingdom, in Jesus’ name.",

The Bible says:<br><br><b>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</b><br>John 11:25-26<br><br>The story behind our memory verse is a pointer to the fact that Jesus indeed is the only One who can still all storms of life, including the most devastating one – death. There was a widow who was left with only one son. The storm of death had taken away her husband and returned to take her only son as well.  As the child was being carried away for burial, the woman and the people bearing the corpse encountered the Storm Stiller.

      "Anyone can become the best. There are however, conditions that must be fulfilled if you want to become the best. The Bible says: <i>“I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth”</i> (Ecclesiastes 10:7). It all depends on the readiness to pay the price. In our Bible text, we read the promises of God that assure us of being the best. However, in the same text, we read the conditions to fulfil – hearkening to the voice of the Lord, observing and doing all His commandments.<br><br>How many of us are ready to hearken to the voice of the Lord today? I have taught my ministers what it means to hearken, which is different from listening.  To hearken is not just to listen but to pay very close attention to the details of the voice and commandment of the Lord. Only then can you fulfil the details of God’s instructions. The Bible says that faith can only come by hearing, and hearing by the word of God and not the word of men or the voice of our carnal body (Romans 10:17). For example, if you want to be the best financially, you must pay close attention to Malachi 3:10, which says:<br><br><b>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</b><br><br>A closer look at the passage above will reveal why some people have been paying their tithes but have not received the promise of super-abundance. “Bring all the tithes” the Bible says - not some. “Bring it” not “Send it” – meaning that God cherishes our presence before Him more than our gift. He wants our fellowship. He is not a beggar; we must come with fear and trembling, praying that He would even accept our tithes and offerings.<br><br>Another example is when we want God to perform miracles through us. The Bible says that some results cannot be achieved without prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21), even though some translations have removed fasting for reasons best known to them.  Beloved, you can be the best if you will pay the price of surrendering your life to Christ and living according to His will.",

      "One great proof of godliness is seen in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, who sacrificed His life for us in love. He expressly commands us to love, according to John 13:34-35:<br><br><b>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</b><br><br>By the rate at which hatred is growing among some self-professing believers, we can ask, “Where is the fulfilment of this commandment?” There could be many reasons for this unpleasant development in the Body of Christ. One is the loss of focus on heaven - where we all aspire to spend eternity. Related to that is the love for this present age. When a person begins to feel jealousy towards another, hatred develops and before long, godliness is thrown to the wind. In our memory verse taken from the main text, John - the Apostle of love, wrote:<br><br><b>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</b><br>1John4:7.<br><br>The above Scripture shows the importance of love among brethren. Beloved, are you living in love?  Remember, if you are not living in love, you are in death, according to 1 John 3:14, which says:<br><br><b>We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</b><br><br>Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13:4-6: <br><br><b>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth</b><br><br>Be sure to remove hatred from your heart today, if you do not want all your Christian service to be in vain on the last day. There’s no godliness without love.",

      "Verse 8 of our text which is our memory verse, says: <i>“He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love”</i> (1 John 4:8). This Scripture implies that not all people we find in Church know God or can be trusted. The early Church leaders did not take the issue of love lightly because they knew godliness is tested by the amount of love a believer possesses. Paul the Apostle prayed thus:<br><br><b>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you: To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</b><br>1 Thessalonians 3:12-13<br><br>It takes love to be godly because God is love. This love made Him give up His only begotten Son as a sacrifice for us so that we would not perish  (John 3:16 and 1 John 4:9). This is the standard that the Almighty God has set for those who claim to be His children. Love makes people go the extra mile in helping others. Jesus commended the good Samaritan in Luke 10:33-37 because the proof of God in us is doing good. Our Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated this as recorded in Acts 10:38:<br><br><b>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</b><br><br>James the Apostle described love in practical terms when he wrote: <i>“Yea, a man may say Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works”</i> (James 2:18). The proof of godliness is service to humanity, according to 2 Timothy 2:21. John 15:9 also says:<br><br><b>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</b><br><br>It is a divine commandment for all children of God to continue in His love. Are you living in the love of Christ?  ",

      "God still speaks to this day, but unfortunately, many people do not hear Him because they are too busy with the affairs of life. The painful thing is that people do not know what they are missing by not listening to their Maker. In today’s text, we read about Abraham’s encounter with the Almighty God.<br><br><b>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee.</b><br>Genesis 12:1<br><br>There are some lessons we can learn from this singular encounter that changed Abraham’s life. One, God discovered the love and sincerity of Abraham so He revealed Himself to him.  This love for God was demonstrated in his positive and prompt response to God’s command to leave his father’s house.  Another lesson is that the dialogue between God and Abraham did not contain commands alone; it was backed by eternal blessings. The Bible says, <i>“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”</i> (Romans 10:17). Abraham became the father of faith because the word of God penetrated his heart. In the Scripture from where we took the memory verse, we read of the encounter of Solomon with the Almighty God. During that divine encounter,  God gave Solomon a blank cheque and this is a typical privilege enjoyed by those who have such dialogues with God.<br><br><b>In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</b><br>1 Kings 3:5<br><br>To be genuine children of God, we must surrender completely to all His commandments. This is where many people often miss it – they are not ready to obey God fully. They want freedom from His commandments; they want to take over the affairs of this life without any recourse to God Almighty. I encourage you to give your life to Jesus Christ today. Seek His face without ceasing - not just what He has to give and you will receive great revelations from Him that will transform your life for good.  ",

      "Yesterday, we started discussing the reality of God still speaking to His people, even to this present moment. In today’s text, we read that though God spoke to His people through His prophets, now He speaks through His Son, Jesus Christ. This is made possible through the Holy Spirit whom Jesus sent to the Church right from the day of Pentecost. He promised:<br><br><b>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</b><br>John 14:26<br><br>God still speaks to His people; no doubt about that. We must however, pay close attention to the later part of the sentence – “to His people.”  In other words, God speaks only to His people. Why only His people?  It is because it is His people who  hearken and act on His words. God has no time to waste talking to those who will not do His bidding. This is why Jesus Christ was fond of speaking to His disciples, whom He knew would abide by His words. He said further:<br><br><b>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</b><br>John 14:21 <br><br>Beloved, there are a lot of blessings for those who hear from God. One of these blessings is that such people would avoid mistakes. For example, the word of God to the people in Cornelius’ household was based on Peter’s ability to hear from God and his obedience to the instructions given to him (Acts 10). In the same vein, Philip’s ability to hear from God took him to the Gazan desert where he gained the soul of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-39).<br><br>For example, hearing from God can reveal the type of business you can do to prosper. It can also help you know where to go, live, or what type of friends you should keep. If you desire to hear from God directly, you must give your life to Christ and live wholly for Him. ",

      "Today's memory verse clearly establishes the need to fear the Lord if we would be wise and gain and understanding of Life. The Lord asks: “<i>A son honoureth his Father and a servant his master: if then i be a father, where is my honour?</i>” (Malachi 1:6). How do we fear the Lord? today’s bible reading gives us ideas on how we fear the most high God. 1, we must magnify the Lord for who He is. It takes the appreciation of God to fear Him. The Psalmist says: <br><br><b>Oh Lord our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the Earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens... when i consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.</b> <br>Psalms 8:1,3<br><br>Secondly, we must put our total trust in him. Lack of trsyt in God may cause us to disobey him like Adam and Eve did. They repeated what God had told them but the serpent countered it, thereby calling God a liar. Genesis 3:4-5 says, <i>“And the Serpent said unto the Woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”</i> if Adam and Eve had the fear of God in them, the devil would not have had his way in their lives. Here we can see that, indeed, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom(Proverbs 9:10)<br><br>Joseph is a classic example of someone who demonstrated the fear of God. due his fear of the Lord, he refuse to take advantage of the adulterous offer of his master's wife. He refuse to commit sexual immorality and told Potiphar's wife: <br><br><b> There is none greater in thus house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art this wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</b> <br>Genesis 39:9<br><br>Fear the Lord and keep his commandments. When you do, the type of blessing that came upon Joseph(Genesis 41:14) will also be your portion",

      "We started discussing the fear of the Lord yesterday and today we will look at some of the blessings that come to those who fear Him. Our memory verse says:<br><br><b>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.</b><br>Psalm 33:18<br><br>The Scripture above reveals a very huge blessing that comes from fearing God. The blessing is that the eye of the Lord will be upon everyone that fears God. This revelation implies several great things amongst which is that when the eye of the Lord is upon an individual, safety is guaranteed. Hebrews 11:6 says that God is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. The Bible further says: <i>“The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good”</i> (Proverbs 15:3). In other words, the eye of the Lord sees everything – even the plans and moves of the wicked who want to harm you and He knows how to deal with them.<br><br>In today’s Bible text we are enjoined to fear the Lord above all gods because they are ordinary works of men (Psalm 96:4-5). We should also note that some people have made human beings their gods - probably for fear of what these people could do to them. Psalm 56:11 however, says: <i>“In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me”.</i> Psalm 118:6 says also, <i>“The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?”</i> Our Lord Jesus Christ taught us to fear God and not man (Matthew 10:28).<br><br>Another demonstration of the fear of the Lord is in verse nine of our text: <i>“O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.”</i> There is no true worship of God without holiness. This is where those who overstretch grace miss it. Obedience is synonymous with holiness and the Scripture says to obey is better than sacrifice (1 Samuel 15:22).  Therefore, we must watch out for our worship - whether it is premised on the fear of the Lord or mere hypocrisy.  As you commit to fear the Lord at all times, His presence will never depart from you, in Jesus’ name. ",

      "God seekers are those who are comfortable with His commandments. People do not seek God today - not because they are ignorant of what they stand to gain seeking the One from whom all blessings flow. Rather, they are not comfortable with His demands on what they consider as their right to decide how to live their lives. The elders say, “A child born yesterday who threatens not to play with us should be asked, ‘Do you think we were lonely before your birth?’”  In other words, if we do not seek God’s face, its to our disadvantage and not God’s.<br><br>David, in our Bible reading, gave his reason for seeking  God when he said: <i>“For I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.”  He said further, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth”</i> (Psalm 121:1-2).  Beloved, it pays to seek the Lord. Isaiah 55:6 encourages us to do so when He may be found and before it is too late. This means there would come a time when man may seek God and He may not be found.<br><br><b>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</b><br>Psalm 32:6<br><br>How do we seek God? God can be sought from His revealed truth, as written in the Holy Scriptures. When we study the word of God consistently, we are seeking God because Jesus is the Word of God and He is God (John 1:1).<br><br>We must also seek God with all of our hearts if we would find Him (Jeremiah 29:13).<br><br>We also seek God by looking out for how to please Him. Jesus said we are His disciples indeed if we do that which He commanded us to. How many self-professing Christians are doing God’s will?<br><br>God has promised that if you seek Him with all your heart, you will find Him. Commit to seeking God with all your heart today and you will find Him. ",

Today, we shall continue to look at how we can seek God and the blessings that come to those who seek Him. We can effectively seek and find God by faith. Hebrews 11:6 says:<br><br><b>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</b><br><br>It takes faith to find God because He is a Spirit. He is invisible to the physical eyes and can only be worshipped genuinely in spirit and in truth (John 4:23). The Bible says something very profound about the life of the children of Israel – <i>“He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel”</i> (Psalm 103:7). The implication of this is that while Moses knew the ways of God, the children of Israel went along with Him through the miracles they saw God performing. Therefore, Moses was deep in God, but the children of Israel were shallow and easily tossed here and there by the challenges they faced on their way to the promised land.  Moses believed in God and took Him by His word; the children of Israel lived by what they saw. This is why they responded negatively to situations they encountered in the wilderness. They refused to see God in all those experiences. Moreover, seekers of God go the extra mile to get to Him. In our Bible text for today, we read about the Greeks who believed in the Messianic message. They came to see and have an encounter with Jesus. <br><br>Beloved, who are you seeking in the Church - the Pastor, the choristers, who?  I congratulate you if you are a seeker of God through Jesus Christ. God seekers are never put to shame. The Bible speaks of those who seek God as being protected from shame.  <i>“They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied”<i/> (Psalms 37:19). <br><br>As we navigate through this second half of year 2023, seek the Lord earnestly and you shall find Him mighty to save, mighty to bless and mighty to keep you alive.",

      "Blood is not just important in the life of man, but also very sacred in the sight of our creator – the Almighty God. It is so sacred that the Bible says anyone who sheds blood will have his or her blood shed also (Genesis 9:6). The first place where we saw God being angry with someone who shed the blood of another fellow is in Genesis 4, in the case of the murder of Abel by his brother Cain. The Almighty God said:<br><br><b>What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.</b><br>Genesis 4:10-11<br><br>The sacredness of blood can be further seen in our memory verse. The life of the flesh is in blood and that is why the blood of Jesus can make atonement for our sins and redeem us from eternal damnation that awaits all sinners.<br><br>Many people have however, shown complete disregard for the sacredness of blood. Many engage in or encourage abortion of unwanted pregnancies, ritual killings, cannibalism and so on. Some have told lies that led to others losing their lives. Some embezzled funds that should have been used to build roads or hospitals thereby causing fatal road accidents and loss of lives due to poor medical services as a result of inadequate funding. Criminals shed blood with impunity without considering the position of the Almighty God concerning such acts.<br><br>Beloved, are you blood-guilty? You must repent today because blood is very sacred and God will not spare unrepentant sinners who are caught in the guilt of blood-letting. The good news is that Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, has paid for all our sins, including blood-guiltiness, as we find in our Bible reading of today. The moment a person acknowledges that Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose that we may have eternal life, that fellow is saved from every sin, including blood-guiltiness of the past.<br><br>Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour, and your sins will be completely forgiven.

On the other hand, lust is an inordinate and compulsive desire for sex, food, riches or power. Lust is natural to unbelievers (2 Peter 2:14-18) but Christians must fight against it by showing self-control (Galatians 5:16-21). The Bible condemns lust and describes it as an abomination to God. A classic example of an inappropriate desire is one that led Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:6). <br><br>Lust and temptation are like tag team champions - they work together so well that it is often difficult to differentiate them. The desire for position or superiority, if not moderated by the Holy Spirit, may translate to an inappropriate quest for power, which has turned some to murderers. Some politicians do this with impunity and when the judgment of God later descends on them, they would say it is the handiwork of the devil. At first, David only desired to have a taste of Bathsheba - the wife of Uriah, but it ended up in the murder of her husband, which then brought a divine curse on David’s lineage.<br><br>Beloved, what are you lusting after? Repent today because it would have a sour and bitter end - sin and death. James 1:13-15 says, <i>“Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” </i><br><br>The above Bible passage reveals fundamental truths about lust and temptation. God is not responsible for human temptation. Temptation becomes activated in an individual when he or she is drawn by an inner lust and thus becomes enticed. Thereafter, lust would produce sin, which eventually leads to death. I pray for you today: you will not become an abandoned project or die before your time, in Jesus’ name.",

      "What is leading you in life? Is it your flesh or the Spirit of God? Whenever you allow the flesh to give you direction, it will always end in regret, but when you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in all things, you can be sure that all will be well. The first step to overcoming lusts and temptations is submission to God, which supplies the power you need to resist the devil, and he will flee from you according to James 4:7. Moreover, the good news is that the faithfulness of God will not allow His children to be tempted above their ability, without making a way of escape for them.<br><br>In our Bible reading today, we saw that God will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear and He will always make a way of escape for us. That is so reassuring. It is for this reason that James 1:2-4, and James 1:12, admonishes us to count it as joy and a blessing, when we are going through diverse temptations. This is because God uses it to perfect the patience of His children, and also as promotion exams for them to receive the crown of life.<br><br>In spite of the assurance above however, if for example, your eyes are always glued to seductive images on the television, the internet, and your surroundings, you are merely feeding the lust in your flesh and such will lead you to hell. Don’t fall into it. If you still tolerate ungodly desires to dwell and grow in your heart, heavenly thoughts, divine visions and inspirations cannot find expression in you.<br><br>All believers are required to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God. Your body is the temple of God, not a showpiece for people. If you choose to dress in a way to stir lust from the opposite sex, you can no longer claim to be a child of God, but an instrument in the hand of the devil. Whoever you honour with your appearance, determines who you truly serve. God has provided us with everything we need to overcome lusts and temptations through Jesus Christ, all we need is to follow His example. Hebrews 4:15 says Jesus our High Priest was in all points tempted, but He scaled over them all without a sin. He has given us the power to resist the devil and to live above lusts and temptations. Hallelujah!",

      "It doesn’t matter how low you are now, there is still hope for a great future. I have seen God lift people from the miry clay and take them to the mountain top. Believe it or not, He will do the same for you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>My story is proof of this; I walked barefoot for the first eighteen years of my life. I can never forget my final year in grammar school. Prize-Giving day was coming up and I was supposed to take home many prizes. Those of us in our final year were to wear white trousers and shoes but I had no trousers – white, black or red. As for shoes, I had never owned one. I started lamenting, “God, you know I have no trousers; why did You allow me to win these prizes?” One day, a boy in the hostel asked me to help him choose which of his six trousers he should wear for the ceremony. I helped him choose one and then said, “Ermm, you know I don’t even have one to wear”. “Pick one,” he offered. Although the trouser was so big that I nearly had to pull the waistband up to my chest, I didn’t care; trousers were trousers.<br><br>Now, the next problem was shoes. It was then I remembered that I had a poor uncle somewhere who had some shoes. The pair he gave me was old, with soles made from old lorry tires. I had to practice walking in them because I had never worn shoes before in my life. However, when the Prize-Giving day finally came, I had trousers and shoes to wear to the occasion. Even if your current situation is worse than what I have just described, I assure you that the Lord who lifted me up can do the same for you. Greater days are coming, if you trust God and lay all in His hands. I must say that God did not raise me just because He felt like doing so; He did it to show forth His own glory. He said when your light shines before men, it is so that they can glorify your Father in heaven (Matthew 5:16).<br><br>If you dedicate your life to glorifying Him and are never shy to give Him glory for whatever you achieve, He will raise you, even higher than you can ever imagine.<br><br>Greater days are ahead of you, in Jesus’ name.",

That is the kind of prayer that gets His attention.<br><br>God can decide to ignore you if you choose to bombard Him with requests. However, if you come to Him telling Him how you plan to advance His kingdom here on earth with the miracle you are asking for, He will pay attention to you. Hannah understood this principle, so she prayed thus:<br><br><b>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the  Lord  all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</b> <br>1 Samuel 1:11<br><br>God granted her request by giving her a son who grew to become a great prophet and then gave her five more children.<br><br>Seek to glorify God first and you will see Him giving you more than you asked for.

No doubt, He loves you, but He has a purpose for everything He does. You may have thought that God drowned Pharaoh in the Red Sea just because He loves the Israelites, but Romans 9:17 says:<br><br><b>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</b><br><br>The real reason God destroyed Pharaoh was to declare His glory and majesty throughout the earth.

If for any reason you cannot fulfil your promise, you must discuss it with the fellow involved and explain the circumstances.  You shouldn’t go back on a promise without any explanation - that is not like your Father in Heaven, whom you claim to be like.<br><br>I remember when I had just finished secondary school and was looking for a way to sponsor my university education. I approached the authorities of a school in Ondo State, and they agreed to sponsor my education on the condition that I would study Mathematics and serve them for five years after getting my degree. Although English was my favourite subject, I had no choice. When I graduated, I went back to serve them, but after two and a half years, I became restless: I wanted a master’s degree. After gaining admission to do my Masters, I appealed to them to let me go for it, assuring them that I would return to finish my bond. They didn’t believe me, but after obtaining the degree, I returned to the school to continue serving them. By then however, I was becoming an embarrassment to them because I had a higher degree than my principal. After another one and a half years, I appealed to them to allow me to get a Ph. D and return, but they said, “You are free to go, and you don’t have to come back”.<br><br>The name of Jesus is powerful - so powerful that Philippians 2:10-11 says that at the mention of that name, every knee in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord.

Today, we would go a bit deeper in discussing how to increase our spiritual capacity. The main goal in increasing our spiritual capacity is to be more spiritually minded; to be more like Jesus and less like our default human nature.<br><br><b>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</b><br><br>Romans 8:7<br><br>The first thing you must do is to surrender your life to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, be baptized by immersion, signifying your death to the flesh and a new life in Jesus. After this, you seek to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and invite Him to dwell in you and take control of your life.<br><br>Once the above steps are taken, you must begin to do less of the things your flesh wants you to do. Don’t let your flesh control you. You cannot be spending all your free time on social media, attending parties, or eating as often as you like. If you give your flesh everything it asks for, you will remain under its control and this can only lead to eternal damnation. Paul said in Acts 17:28 that it is in Jesus that we believers live, move and have our being. That must be your testimony too. You also need the Holy Spirit to keep the flesh under control. You are not strong enough to deal with the flesh by yourself (Romans 8:13).<br><br>To continue to grow your spiritual capacity, you must truly pray without ceasing, as 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says. If you are not willing to pray consistently and fervently at all times, you are not yet willing to increase your spiritual capacity. When you cannot pray in understanding, switch to praying in the Spirit. Fasting and studying the word of God daily must also become your lifestyle (Jeremiah 15:16). You must also seek to hear God at all times. Ask Him questions about things you don’t understand in the Scriptures.<br><br>These steps may appear simple and straight forward, but many people find it difficult to do them consistently.",

This is clearly illustrated in the case of Job and his friends (Job 42:8).<br><br>Many people are perishing today because there is a shortage of intercessors willing to carry the burdens of God in the place of prayer. Enough of praying for yourself alone. Don’t be a selfish Christian. When you pray, let God put into your heart what or who you should pray for. If He lays in your heart to pray for another country that is not yours, don’t say, “What is my business with those people?” Pray as He has laid in your heart so that at least one person there can be saved. Sometimes He will ask you to pray for one fellow; do so, because your prayer may be what would make the difference between the fellow living or dying. God is seeking intercessors; will He find you?",

For example, when elections are coming up in your state or country, you and other Christians in that vicinity should come together and pray fervently that only the will of God would stand. You must pray these kinds of prayers not only during elections but all the time. The Lord said in Isaiah 62:1: <i>“For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.”</i><br><br>When you hear of or know someone working especially hard for the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth, you should begin to pray for that fellow. Your prayer and fasting for that person will be very instrumental in their success and you will also be a part of that success. In Esther 4:15-17, when Esther was going to turn around the evil policy that sought to kill the Israelites, she asked that everyone on her team should fast and pray for her. That is why she received so much favour from the king, so that he quickly ordered the death of his well-trusted right-hand man who had generated the said evil policy.<br><br>We need to pray for our leaders. They may not tell you, but they face a lot of battles from the devil and need your prayers to win these battles. Pastors are included in this group; you must pray for pastors and ministers of the gospel if you want the Kingdom of God to continue to win against the devil.<br><br>Lastly, Matthew 5:44 says you should pray for people who despise and persecute you:<br><br><b>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</b><br><br>Can you pray for people who are about to kill you? That is what Stephen did in Acts 7:60 and we see the result in Acts 8:1-8 when Jesus came Himself to witness to Saul, who later became one of the greatest Apostles of his time. Pray for those doing evil too, for them to encounter God and they may be some of the greatest vessels of the Lord in their time.",

      "The greatest benefit of intercession is that God draws you closer to Himself. He tells you His next move because He needs you to intercede concerning it. When you are an intercessor, you get so close to God that you feel His heartbeat. You share in His very burden for the souls of men. God sees intercessors just like He sees Jesus because He is the number one intercessor. 1 John 2:1 says He is always with the Father, advocating for us. Intercessors carry a strong burden for the souls of men, just like Jesus did when He laid down His life for mankind. Moses - a true intercessor, illustrated how much he carried this burden in Exodus 32:31-32:<br><br> <b>And Moses returned unto the  Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</b><br><br>He asked God to forgive the people of Israel or remove his name from the book of life. That is how much the burden of the souls of men is on intercessors. That is why intercessors are in the same department as Jesus Christ. Jesus is their Head of Department and whatever prayer comes from that department is seen by God as coming from Jesus Christ Himself.<br><br>Solomon cared about the people of God more than he did about himself. That is why, when he only asked for wisdom to lead the people right, God decided to bless him far beyond his expectations. Intercessors hardly have personal prayer points because before their needs arise, God has already resolved them.<br><br>Real intercessors don’t intercede just for their own benefit. Intercession is borne out of love and passion for the souls of men. Like Daniel in Daniel 9:1-19, when an intercessor sees the promise of God not being fulfilled in the life of a person or nation, he or she would begin to pray concerning that situation. He or she would keep reminding God of that promise until it is fulfilled, just to ensure that God’s will is established and that the souls of men are preserved from danger.",

      "When I was a younger Christian, 1 Thessalonians 5:17 which says, <i>“Pray without ceasing”</i> used to baffle me until the Lord explained it to me.<br><br>I used to wonder how it was possible to pray without ceasing. What would I be saying? The Lord then let me know that the only way I could pray without ceasing was to do so in the Spirit. This implies that God expects every believer to pray in the Spirit all day.<br><br>Believe me honestly, you don’t know all you truly need. Even if you argue that you know all that you need at this moment, do you know what will happen in the next two hours? If you don’t know what will happen, then, how will you pray about it? That is why you have the Holy Spirit to pray those prayers through you. You ask for what you want with your words; the Holy Spirit will help you ask for what you ought to have when you pray in tongues. Without the Holy Spirit, you cannot pray correctly. Romans 8:26 affirms this:<br><br><b>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</b><br><br>Ephesians 5:18 says further:<br><br><b>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.</b><br><br>Alcoholics will tell you that they are always craving more and more alcohol. That is how you should become addicted to praying in the Spirit. The more you pray in the Spirit, the more filled you would be. You would realise that it is difficult to stop praying sometimes. As you pray, you get more and more engulfed in the Spirit and before you know it, everything you do would be influenced by Him. Galatians 5:17 says that the flesh and the Spirit are always at war. The more you pray in the Spirit, the more energized your spirit man would be to win that war against the flesh, so it becomes easy to put it under (1 Corinthians 9:27). You would begin to long for things of the Spirit rather than those of the flesh.",

      "Several years ago, when I was a very young preacher, there was a good campground in Nigeria called the ‘Youth Camp’. We would often go there for retreats. One day while we were there for a retreat, the owners told me they wanted to sell the place for N100,000. We had nothing close to that kind of money then, but I had faith that God would buy the place for us. I gathered my people together and we prayed round the camp, confessing that it was already ours in line with the word of God in Joshua 1:3 - <i>“Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you”</i>. Later on, when the owners saw that we were not forthcoming with the money, they sold it to a bigger ministry. We were devastated. We turned to God, “But Lord, we prayed, we used Your word”. All through, He remained silent. He remained silent because He had something bigger in store for us. He knew that forty acres of land would be too small for where He was taking us. By God’s grace, the auditorium we now call the Old Auditorium sits on over forty acres of land. Our new auditorium is now 3 kilometres by 3 kilometres.<br><br>If you have prayed, praised God, and are sure of your faith, but God remains silent, it is likely because He has something bigger in store for you than what you are asking for. He is a God who takes pleasure in exceeding His children’s expectations. The Bible says in Ephesians 3:20: <i>“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,”</i><br><br>In our Bible reading for today, the man at the pool of Bethesda was explaining his predicament to Jesus, hoping that He would help him get into the water. Jesus however ignored him and gave him something greater. This is the case many times when you are praying and it looks like God is ignoring you; He may just be preparing something greater for you. Don’t give up hope; trust Him. Isaiah 55:8-9 says:<br><br><b>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. 9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</b>",

      "In John 13:21-30, during the Last Supper, Jesus said someone was going to betray Him and Peter made John the Beloved ask Jesus who the person was. John asked and Jesus responded in a whisper that only John could hear.<br><br>In one of our Holy Ghost Services, God said, “All my sheep hear my voice, but very few hear my whisper”. There is a difference between when God speaks and when He whispers. When you hear God’s whisper, you will be several steps ahead of your colleagues. You will become number one in whatever you have set out to do. I pray that you will begin to hear God’s whisper from today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>To hear God’s whisper, you must be closer to Him than everyone else. Before John heard Jesus’ whisper, the Bible tells us in John 13:25 the position he took: <i>“He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?”</i><br><br>You cannot be closer to a person than the fellow lying on his or her chest. That is the position that you must take. You must get so close to God that you can practically hear His heartbeat. Only a few people are as close to God as this and you will see that they are addicted soul-winners because God’s heart beats for the souls of men.<br><br>The good thing is that God is willing to bring you very close to Him. He said in James 4:8:<br><br><b>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</b><br><br>The question however is, are you willing to draw near to Him and if so, how closely? Every time you sin, a distance is created between you and God (Isaiah 59:1-2, Psalm 66:18). The first thing you therefore need to do to get close enough to God to hear His whisper is to be holy. Once you are holy, God will begin to tell you things that are for your ears only. Do you want to hear God’s whispers and become a custodian of divine secrets? Draw closer to Him in holiness, soul-winning, and fellowship today.",

      "In our Bible reading for today, God asked Elijah the same question twice: <i>“What doest thou here, Elijah?”</i>  God is not talkative; if He asks the same question twice, there must be a reason behind it. Usually, when God asks you a question, it is a test. In John 6:5-7, when Jesus saw the crowd, He turned and asked one of the disciples where they would find food to feed the people. The Bible added that the question was to test him, for He already knew what He would do. The teacher knows the answer; He only tests the student when He asks a question.<br><br>In Genesis 3:1-7, when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and hid behind a tree, God had already seen them. Yet He asked, <i>“Adam, where art thou?”</i> When Adam said “We heard Your voice and were afraid because we were naked”. He asked further, “Who told you that you’re naked?” He knew already, but still He asked to see what they would say. Unfortunately, they were pushing the blame and so they got the punishment they deserved. In Genesis 4:3-10, God asked Cain where Abel was. When Cain said he didn’t know, God responded, “His blood is crying to me from where you killed and buried him”.  God knew where Abel was from the onset, yet He asked Cain where he was and sadly, Cain never told the truth.<br><br>When God asks you a question, especially concerning a sin that you committed, fall on your face and beg for mercy. That question is a test to see if you are really repentant or not. If, on the other hand, He asks you a question that is not pertaining to a sin you committed, my advice is that you ask the Holy Spirit to help you answer.<br><br>In our Bible reading for today, God asked Elijah the same question twice and he gave the same answer both times. I believe God asked the second time because He had hoped Elijah would answer differently. I feel that if Elijah had not answered the questions with frustration, he wouldn’t have been asked to anoint his replacement yet. In Ezekiel 37:3, Ezekiel was wise. God asked Him, “Can these bones live?” He did not know how to answer, so he responded, “You know, Lord”. God’s questions are tests; ask the Holy Spirit to help you answer them when they come.",

      "John 3:1-2 tells us clearly that Jesus was a teacher. It may amaze you that throughout His ministry on earth, nobody ever called Him Evangelist or Prophet or Pastor; they kept calling Him ‘Teacher’. Everywhere Jesus went, He went teaching, including by the seaside (Mark 2:13).<br><br>Jesus is a teacher and likes to relate with us as such; this is good news because the teacher is held responsible for the success or failure of a student. If the teacher can then prove that the student failed because he or she refused to obey instructions, then the teacher is relieved of that responsibility. You see this clearly when Jesus gave His report at the end of His time on earth in John 17:12. He said: <i>“While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</i>”<br><br>Thus if you listen to all Jesus’ instructions and obey Him, He will definitely help you make it to heaven at the end of time.<br><br>After Jesus resurrected from the dead, His role advanced from teacher to Teacher of teachers.  This is why, in John 20:16, Mary Magdalene called Him ‘Rabboni’, a special title used to honour great teachers. For those of us who are teachers of the gospel, James 3:1 says that we would receive greater condemnation on the last day if our works are found wanting. Of course, this is because such people are responsible for the souls of men that the Almighty God allocates to them. The good news however, is that we have a Teacher who will teach us how to pass this great test on the last day. He is always there to teach you how to succeed in whatever assignment He commits into your hands. That is why I have always told my children not to get so busy with ministry that they lose connection with the Teacher of teachers. Believe me honestly, without Him, you cannot do ministry right. You cannot be snatching souls from the devil’s  kingdom and expect him to be soft on you. He will deploy many tactics to bring you down, but if you remain connected to the Teacher of teachers, you will win in the end.<br><br>Stay connected to the Teacher of teachers. ",

Any situation that involves begging to eat is called poverty. The Almighty God’s plan is not for you to be a beggar, but rather that you would prosper. For several years, the enemy kept the Church in darkness and pastors began to equate holiness with poverty. The devil knows that you can spread the gospel faster if you have money. I don’t know about you, but in the name of Jesus Christ, I am going to prosper because light stands for prosperity. <br><br>Darkness works to make you poor, but it is the duty of the Light to make you rich. 2 Corinthians 8:9 says clearly:<br><br><b>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</b><br><br>He became poor that you, through His poverty, might become rich. If you are truly a child of God, carrying the Light of the Almighty within you, I have good news for you: all those who have been saying that you are going to die poor shall be disappointed. 3 John 2 says He wishes above all things that you would prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.

He wanted to buy food with the money but knew that if he did, he would end up walking home like his wife had said, so he decided to just buy fuel.

      "From Bartimaeus’ story in Mark 10:46-52, we see that when he called on Jesus for help, some people told him to shut up. He had not offended them, yet they hated him. This is however not surprising because darkness also stands for hatred while light represents love. Proverbs 14:20 says the poor is hated even by his own neighbors. Darkness goes hand in hand with poverty and poverty leads to hatred. People can hate you just because you are poor. Thank God light stands for love. Romans 8:37 says we are more than conquerors because of the One who loved us. When you come in contact with The Light, your victory is guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how many people hate you; if Jesus is on your side, you will be a winner.<br><br>You would notice that, when Bartimaeus was crying for help, not a single person encouraged him until the Light of the world called for him. Bartimaeus was a lonely man. There is a direct link between darkness and loneliness. In Psalm 121:5, the Bible says the Lord is your shade upon your right hand. This means God is always with you. If you come in contact with the Light of the world, you can never be lonely again. There are many people who are rich and successful in their endeavours, yet lonely. This is because they have not come in contact with the Light of the world. Bartimaeus’ loneliness ended the day he met Jesus because he instantly became a celebrity and we are still talking about him today.<br><br>Light drives away loneliness while darkness embraces it. Many times, loneliness is a result of works of darkness. It is the Light who made the statement in Genesis 2:18 that it is not good that man should be alone. Years ago, a mother came to me and said she needed help. She had four daughters – the youngest of whom was 28 years old, yet they were all single. As I was about to pray, the Lord told me to ask some questions and I discovered there was a demon in their family who had laid claim to the girls. This demon was the one preventing them from getting married. We prayed and God gave us victory over the evil covenant. Within a year, all four of them were married. Any evil covenant you have entered into that may be stopping you from moving to the next level will be destroyed by the Light today, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Darkness is linked with barrenness. This implies that light is equivalent to fruitfulness. When you study the Scriptures, you will see that God is interested in your fruitfulness. The very first commandment He gave to man is <i>“Be fruitful and multiply”</i> (Genesis 1:28). In Exodus 23:26, the Almighty God said clearly: <i>“There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil”</i>. I am decreeing, that if you are trusting God for the fruit of the womb, you will carry your own twins soon, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There are some cases of barrenness where the doctor cannot see anything wrong with the couple because the devil is at work. A woman’s mother-in-law once visited her house and said, “My daughter, eat this bread and use it to block your womb”. The girl ate it, not taking the woman’s words seriously. From that day, she stopped menstruating for several years.  Thank God we held a programme in her town that ran for some days. One afternoon during the programme, she slept and had a dream. In the dream, some people dressed like medical doctors laid her on the table, opened up her belly and began to pull out a rope. The rope was very long, and at the end of the rope was a very black piece of bread. By the time she woke, she saw that the bed was wet with her menstrual flow. The last time I heard from her, she already had 5 children. Whatever darkness has used to stop your fruitfulness - whether it is in child-bearing or otherwise, the Light will deal with it.<br><br>Some people asked me not too long ago, “Why are you against same-sex marriage?” I asked in turn, “How will two men or two women produce a child?” They mentioned adoption, but who is going to produce the child they are going to adopt? If we all adopt this lifestyle, the human race would become extinct in less than a hundred years. I told them, “The devil is a liar”. I don’t care what people or organisations say, I will stand by the truth. The word of God is clear: “Be fruitful and multiply”.<br><br>Anyone trying to do anything that disobeys that instruction is disobeying God Himself.",

      "From the story of Bartimaeus, we can see that darkness and stagnation go hand in hand. Bartimaeus must have been on that same spot begging since he became blind. Since stagnation is linked to darkness, this means that light stands for progress and promotion. Psalm 75:6-7 says:<br><br><b>For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</b><br><br>1 Samuel 2:8 tells us that God can pick up a beggar from a dunghill and keep promoting him until he is standing with princes. If you notice that you seem to have been in the same position for years now, then it is likely that you are in darkness. You need to connect to the Light now, so that you can make real progress.<br><br>Stagnation is primarily caused by forces of darkness. The devil fights progress. That is why when Nehemiah was trying to rebuild the city walls, the devil raised many enemies to stop the work. One fellow was talking to me some years ago; he said, “I don’t know what’s happening; it seems as if my enemies are increasing”. I said, “Tell me a little bit about how things have been with you in the past couple of years”. He said everything had been good; whatever he touched had been prospering. I said, “That is the reason”. There are those who love it when you come to them to beg for food, but the moment you begin to make progress, hatred comes. Darkness does not want you to progress, but thank God light stands for promotion.<br><br>There was a man who had been on one spot for many years. During one of our programmes, God spoke to me and I announced, “There is someone here; somebody close to you will die next week. Don’t be sad because, after the death, your promotion will come”. The following week, his father died, but before the man passed on, he confessed that he had said, “How can my son be greater than I?”, so he decided to use diabolical powers to make the boy stagnant. Almost immediately after the father died, the promotion of the young man began. Anyone sitting on your promotion and refusing to stand will be uprooted by the Almighty God, in Jesus’ name.",

      "From the story of Bartimaeus, we learn that darkness and sorrow go hand in hand. You don’t have to understand philosophy to know that a blind beggar must have been sad. I pray for you: Your eyes will never grow dim, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Darkness and sorrow go hand in hand, which means light brings joy. Psalm 16:11 says: <i>“Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”</i><br><br>Our Bible reading for today says that when the Lord turned around the people’s captivity, their mouths were filled with laughter. That is the nature of Light; He brings laughter. Light stands for joy (John 16:24).<br><br>There was this woman whose children were dying so she visited a white garment prophet for a solution. When she got there, the man’s wife gave her a piece of kolanut to eat, claiming that was the solution to her problem. She ate it and at night, found herself in a witchcraft meeting. Before long, she had offered up her husband. After about two years, the other witches asked for one of her children - the very children she wanted to protect. She attended one of our programmes in Ilorin and while I was preaching, I noticed a commotion in the congregation. After the service, the ushers told me that the woman’s dress caught fire during the preaching. We prayed a simple prayer after which she gave her life to Christ and when she went home, she excreted a dead snake. She was free from that day on. Darkness does not give joy, all it has to offer is sorrow. Proverbs 10:22 says it is only the blessings of God that maketh rich and addeth no sorrow. If the devil is offering you something that seems good, you will not fall for it, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>If you are truly a child of Light, how can you stay away from Jesus - the Light of the world? Jesus said in Matthew 11:28, <i>“Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.”</i> If you remain in darkness, you will keep suffering, but when you turn to Jesus Christ, He gives you a new beginning and turns the tide for you. If you really want to be in the Light, then you should begin to live holy from today.",

      "The call of God is actually a call to God. It isn’t a call to something but a call to Himself.  When He calls you, He is saying, “Come closer to me”. In Mark 3:14, the Bible says that the first reason He called the disciples was that they should be with Him.<br><br>The call of God is two-fold. First, He can call you to leave your sinful ways (Matthew 11:28). This is the very first call that every man will receive. It is a call that brings you close and guarantees an eternity with Him if you answer. Thus, when you hear an altar call, it is God Himself calling you to salvation. If you are still committing sin, this is one call that you should not ignore. You don’t know the final call that God will make for you to come to Him for salvation.<br><br>Many have received God's call to salvation but then, after a while, started to live in sin again. That is not how this call works (Luke 9:62). If you sincerely answer the call to salvation, then holiness would be your lifestyle. If you become saved and then start living a double life where you sin willfully, the Bible says that God would spew you out of His mouth (Revelation 3:16) - in other words, He would reject you completely. 2 Timothy 2:19 says, <i>“Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”</i><br><br>If you claim to be a child of God, then you must depart from all iniquity. If you don’t depart from iniquity, then God would not recognise you as His child.<br><br><b>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;</b><br><br>1 Peter 2:9<br><br>Once God calls you out of darkness into His marvelous light, you are described as a holy nation - not an unholy one.

      "After God has called you to salvation, the next call is to join Him in redeeming the world. Now, you must note that He doesn’t only call people from the altar but from all walks of life to serve Him in various capacities. For example, He can call some to join Him in the technology field because He wants to use technology as a tool to reach the unsaved.<br><br>His agenda goes beyond the altar into the everyday lives of people. God is not a Sunday-Sunday God. He is God every single day and so He is using people to accomplish His agenda daily. Pastors don’t reserve the right to be used by God. As far as you are born again - whether you are in business, arts and entertainment or even in fashion, God can use you in that field to fulfil His will. He said in Colossians 3:17: <i>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.”</i><br><br>Thus, whatever it is that you do, make sure you are doing it in the name of Jesus Christ. When you do something in the name of someone, it means it is not you but the fellow being represented that’s doing it. In other words, when God calls you to an industry, you are not to go there to do your will but His. His agenda is already set; all He does when He calls you is to join Him in bringing it to pass. Thus, when you feel Him pulling you to work for Him in a certain field of life, then you must ask Him what His agenda is concerning that thing you are to do. Everything you do must be in line with His agenda. You should also note that you are His representative there and you must not do what He Himself wouldn’t.<br><br>As a reward for answering the call to join Him in His redemptive work in the world, God makes sure that all things work together for your good.<br><br><b>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</b><br><br>Romans 8:28<br><br>Once you are called according to His purpose and you answer that call, all things will begin to work together for your good.",

      "I thank God that He made sure I studied Mathematics before I became a preacher. Every Mathematician knows that for any formula to work, certain conditions must be met. If you meet God’s conditions, He will do for you what He is not doing for others. This is so important that it could be the greatest thing you have ever heard or read in your life, because if you begin to meet His conditions, people around you would begin to ask, “What is your secret?”<br><br>When people sing, “Abraham’s blessings are mine”, many of them think it is just by singing it that they’ll have the blessing. When you do your research, you’ll see that Abraham himself, in Genesis 22:16-17, got his blessing by being willing to sacrifice his only son to God. That day, God swore by Himself to bless Abraham and Isaac also, because the boy was willing to lay down his life. When Isaac was going to pass on the blessing, he gave it to the son who brought him a meal that he loved (Genesis 27:1-29). I agree that when you became a Christian, you received the blessing of Abraham, but to tell you the whole truth, you got it on credit. You must be ready to give something for that blessing to really begin to manifest in your life. Nothing goes for nothing.<br><br>When God saved my soul, with joy I gave Him the first house I ever built - a little mud house plastered with cement. Thereafter, God built another one for me in my little village and when He needed it, I gave it to Him too. I also gave the first house I built in Lagos to God when He needed it. These are just a few of the things that I can tell you here. By the time God responded, He did so in a marvelous way. For example, anywhere I go to now and there’s a member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God there, I can be sure of a good place to sleep that night. If I announce that I need a car for an assignment tomorrow for example, I am likely to wake up the next day to see a fleet of cars brought by different people and each one would want me to pick the one they brought. If you really want God to bless you, you should ask yourself, “Have I met the conditions necessary for me to be blessed?”",

      "The first lesson I want us to learn in today’s devotional reading is that God is delighted in our prosperity and this is why He gave us His commandments.<br><br>Psalm 1:1-3 says: <br><br><b>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</b><br><br>As we progress in this second half of the year, we should take note of the factors that will aid our all-round prosperity. Some people misinterpret or do not know why the rich man in Luke 12:16-21 died the way he did at the peak of his prosperity. It was simply because he did not acknowledge God as the Source of his wealth. He was also so engrossed in acquiring wealth that he did not know when his time was up; hence he did not prepare for eternity (Luke 16:21).  His error was not that he became rich because as a matter of fact, God is interested in the prosperity of His children. The Bible says in 3 John 2:<br><br><b>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</b><br><br>The Bible says further that God gives the power to get wealth (Deuteronomy 8:18). The Church also is expected to prosper through all-round growth. For example, Luke 12:1 describes the audience of Jesus as an ‘innumerable multitude of people’ which signifies a huge growth in His ministry. Zechariah 1:17 also says that, through prosperity shall the cities of the Lord be spread abroad.<br><br>The Bible however, also says that the so-called prosperity of sinners shall destroy them (Proverbs 1:32).  Beware of ungodly means of getting wealth, so that you can avoid the sorrows that come with ill gotten riches (1 Timothy 6:6-10).",

      "If I were to ask you, “Which do you consider more important - the blessing or the Blesser?” you are likely to say it is the Blesser. However, there are millions of self-professing Christians around the world today who prioritise God’s blessings above the One who blessed them in the first place. When you begin to choose your job over God, you are prioritising the blessing over the Blesser. I want you to do an honest check within yourself now: which one have you been prioritising – the blessing or the Blesser?<br><br>The unfortunate thing about prioritising the blessing over the Blesser is that the Blesser can withdraw His blessings at any time. In 1 Samuel 16:1, God told Samuel to stop pleading on Saul’s behalf because He had given the throne to someone else.  In Genesis 48:20, we see how Jacob blessed Ephraim above his older brother Manasseh. Ephraim eventually became ten times more successful than his brother (Deuteronomy 33:17). However, when success came, Ephraim forgot God (Psalm 78:9-11). God kept sending prophets to Ephraim, but he refused to listen to the Blesser. After some time, God said, “Let him alone” (Hosea 4:17). By the time we get to Hosea 5:9, God said that Ephraim would be desolate. Ephraim lost his blessings because he prioritised them above the Blesser. When success comes, don’t forget God because He has the power to give and to take away.<br><br>When I became the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I decided by faith that God would feed everyone that came for our annual convention. One of the young men who was a baker said he would provide the bread for breakfast. He later on changed his mind and decided not to supply us with bread as he had promised because he didn’t like a message I preached. God however, sent help to us and we were able to purchase the bread we required. Years later, my baker friend appeared at my house very early one morning; I said, “What can I do for you? You came very early”.  He said he would have come earlier but one of his tires got flat and he didn’t have a spare. This was a man who used to have numerous cars; now, he didn’t even have a spare tire because he placed the blessing above the Blesser. <br><br>Beloved, focus on the Blesser and not the blessing.",

      "Before you were born, God knew you (Jeremiah 1:4-5). He not only knows your beginning, He knows your end too (Jeremiah 29:11). Some people call this destiny. Many believe that people’s fates are decided by God no matter what they do. If you pay attention to the first part of our Bible reading today, you will see the word, ‘Foreknow’. Your destiny is determined by His knowledge of the things you will do and the decisions you will make throughout your lifetime. In other words, your destiny is ultimately decided by you.<br><br>If God tells you your destiny now, it is based on all the knowledge He has about you. For example, God knows all that you have done in the past. In 2 Kings 5:20-27, when Gehazi collected Naaman’s gifts secretly, Elisha didn’t leave the house, but he saw everything. Gehazi lied about what he had done and became destined to be a leper and a father of lepers. What you have done in the past and what you are doing now are good pointers to your destiny.<br><br>God also knows what you are going to do tomorrow. This explains Romans 9:10-14, where the Bible says that before Esau and Jacob were born, God had already loved Jacob and hated Esau. People may say that is unfair, but God already knew in advance what would happen in Genesis 25:29-34 - that Esau would love his stomach more than his birthright.,br><br>Now you may say, “Since He knows my future, that means it is already fixed; no matter how hard I try, what will be will be”. No, that is not correct. In Daniel 2:20-21, the Bible says God changes times. He can rearrange your future. Don’t forget that He is Supreme and can do as He pleases. The fact that you are alive today reading this particular message means there is hope for you to end well. In Luke 23:39-43, a criminal on his way to hell got salvation at the last minute. Jesus Christ rearranged His destiny and he ended up in heaven. If you sincerely cry to God today, confess your past and present sins while determining to live holy henceforth, He can rearrange your future and make sure that you have a glorious destiny; it is all in your own hands.",

      "While studying the word of God, I discovered that God performs various miracles through the Holy Communion. One of such miracles is making rich those who partake in the meal according to His will. The occult also tries to emulate this when witch doctors ask people seeking sudden riches to eat some charms that will make them rich overnight. They will however, also reach an agreement to be rich for only  a few years before the charm kills them.  In Yorubaland, such a person would be said to have eaten<i>lukudi.</i> <br><br>There was one man who ate <i>lukudi,</i> but instead of getting money, the charm began to eat him up from the inside. He came to the Headquarters of The Redeemed Christian Church of God and pretended to give his life to Jesus. We prayed and he vomited the charm he had eaten. After a while, we noticed that he stopped coming to Church, only to later hear that he had gone to eat the charm again. This time around the money came, but when the agreed date for his death started drawing near, he decided to run to England, and ended up dying in the plane.<br><br>As is typical with the devil, whatever he gives is always short-lived and he collects the fellow’s soul in return. Mark 8:36 asks: <i>“What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?”</i> With the Holy Communion however, not only will you become rich after eating it, you will also have long and eternal life.<br><br>According to Exodus 12:35-36, the day the children of Israel ate the Holy Communion, the wealth of the Egyptians was handed over to them. When you eat the Holy Communion, the wealth the Almighty God has assigned to you that is in the hands of the enemy will be transferred to you. As you eat the Holy Communion worthily, you will receive payment with interest for every unpaid labour of your life, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>There is another charm that is said to give promotion and good luck when eaten. In Yorubaland, it is known as <i>Awure.</i> The problem with these charms however, is that the witch doctors who prepare them are poor themselves, yet people believe they can make them prosperous. When you eat the Holy Communion however, it will bring you genuine promotion and those people who have been treating you as a servant will come and bow before you.",

The only person who died barren is the woman that mocked her husband – King David, for dancing before God (2 Samuel 6:20-23). If you have been considered barren, God is about to surprise you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>You however, have a part to play as God is set to make you experience all-round fruitfulness.   John 15:1-5 makes it clear that you must be joined to the Fruitful Vine to be fruitful. He said in verse 4,<i>“Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.”</i> To become fruitful, you must be totally joined to the Fruitful Vine. You must abide in Him.<br><br>Many years ago, we held a programme in Lagos, Nigeria, during which I urged everybody to ask for something special from God. There was a lady there who said, “Father, I’m not going to ask You for anything anymore because I have repeatedly asked You for what I wanted, and You didn’t give me. I used to ask You for a husband and now I’m too old to have children, so I won’t ask again. However, I will continue to serve You all the days of my life”. God heard her and a few days later, a man came and said he wanted to marry her. She looked at the man and told him to pray again as she was already past menopause.  He said he already had children, but he was a widower, so he was looking for a wife who would also be a mother to them. They got married and nine months later, she gave birth to twins – two boys. When you commit yourself to the True Vine, He will make sure that you become fruitful.<br><br>The True Vine can make you fruitful in every aspect of your life. God is the One who said in Leviticus 19:13 that everyone must pay the wages of those that work for them. If you are committed to God and His kingdom, you will definitely bear fruit. God said He is not unrighteous to forget your labour of love (Hebrews 6:10).<br><br>The Lord will definitely reward you as long as you remain connected to Him.",

No matter your status today, you can still have dominion. The Almighty God wants you to become influential, but for that to happen, you must obey Him and His commandments - no matter the situation. When you do this, He will see to it that you are always the head and never the tail (Deuteronomy 28:13). If you want to increase in influence, do what He says. <br><br>One major thing He said you should do is to win souls. Our Bible reading for today says you can become Jesus’ friend and I’m telling you, when you befriend the Lord, you become very influential because of your relationship with He who has influence across all realms (Philippians 2:10). When you become a friend of Jesus Christ, doors open to you automatically. I can tell you stories upon stories about countries that refused to register The Redeemed Christian Church of God and the same people would call us back within months to offer us our registration certificate. When you are a friend of Jesus, you will do what He commanded in John 15:14-15 - win souls and make sure they abide. If you do this, He has promised that anything you ask in His name, He will do it. That is great influence.<br><br>In John 12:32, the Bible says if you will lift Jesus, He would draw all men to Himself. If you keep on preaching, witnessing and winning souls, men will come from all over the place to meet with you. Thus, if you want to be influential, 2 Timothy 4:2 says you should preach in and out of season. Preach when it is convenient and when it is not convenient. If every one of us reading this devotional today goes out and wins at least one soul today, imagine how much rejoicing would be in heaven because of us. Do your part and He will surely do His.<br><br>My greatest desire was to be the youngest Vice-Chancellor in Africa, but when I became born again and God called me into full-time ministry, I abandoned my ambition.

      "God wants you to grow spiritually so that you would eventually become a giant in the spirit realm. In 1 Corinthians 12:31, God says you are allowed to covet earnestly the best gifts. When I read that passage, I told God, “Lord, give me a double portion of the Spirit of Elisha, double the spirit of Peter, double the spirit of Paul, double the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry, add everything together and double it again”. He responded that I was asking for trouble because people would not let me rest. I said I wanted it still because I could not afford to be anything else but a spiritual giant. You must make up your mind not to be an ordinary Christian from today.<br><br>If you want to become a spiritual giant, 2 Kings 2:1-8 teaches that you must be loyal to your own Elijah. When Elijah wanted to leave this world, Elisha followed him three times; each time, Elijah told him to go back, but he refused. Your Elijah is your father-in-the-Lord. In 2 Kings 2:9-15, when Elijah was departing, Elisha got a double portion of his spirit.<br><br>One day, I was praying that my children would be greater than I, and one of them said, “Anyone who will be greater than you probably will never eat again”. He said that because of how often I fast, but then I told him not to leave God out of the equation. It doesn’t matter how great God made your father-in-the-Lord, you can become greater just by honouring and being loyal to him. Elisha got a double portion of the spirit of Elijah because he pursued the same vision as he.<br><br>Learn to minister to the one whom God has placed over you spiritually. In 2 Kings 3:11-12, the Bible tells us that Elisha ministered constantly to his spiritual father. It wasn’t long after that in 2 Kings 13:14 that we read that a king called him ‘Father’. If you are committed to honouring your father-in-the-Lord by serving him, you would receive something that you could otherwise have laboured greatly in the spirit to get. Somebody once said that the tail of a lion is more powerful than the head of a dog. Your father-in-the-Lord is already a lion; if you are committed to following Him as he follows Jesus, you can do greater things than when you are on your own. ",

      "Restoration can be simply described as the process of returning something to its original state. Divine restoration is an act of God because only the Creator of heaven and earth has the knowledge and ability to restore humanity to its original state. The unfortunate error of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden robbed mankind of their dominion in creation. This led to separation from God and attracted death and other terrible curses. Thereafter, life became full of different kinds of sins - idolatry, immorality, wickedness - until life became unbearably difficult. At this point, our loving and compassionate God decided to end the misery by restoring man’s dominion through redemption by the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Restoration is a complete package that includes forgiveness of sins, freedom from guilt and mercy rather than judgement. It usually comes as an act of mercy, favour, compassion, and love, with the sole aim of reconciling mankind to God. Restoration often involves the remission of sin, cancellation of debts, and reversing the irreversible. Our God is a God of restoration. Jesus restored life to Lazarus in John 11:43-44 and the son of the widow of Nain in Luke 7:11-15. He restored sight to a man born blind in John 9:1-7. Our God can restore ill health, failing businesses, damaged relationships, broken marriages and lost opportunities. All you need to do is cry unto Him in prayer. May you be fully restored in every area of your life, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Bible teaches that as God is, so He wants us to be in this world. We must forgive everyone that has offended us while also seeking the forgiveness of those we have offended. Forgiveness is to be without limits, as stated in Luke 17:3-4 and Matthew 18:21-22. Forgiveness leads to peace, reconciliation, healing, progress, joy, prosperity, and answered prayers. Make up your mind to be at peace with all men (Hebrews 12:14), forgive everybody that has offended you and settle all pending disputes with your neighbours. Let the love of God radiate through you to others so that you would become a beneficiary of the abundant blessings of the Lord. Be restored to God first, then pursue restoration of every broken relationship as God guides you.",

Why then do many parents or guardians leave their children to be devoured by the fox when they see that they have strayed?<br><br>When the children God has planted around you err, protect them from the error they have made first to ensure it doesn’t destroy them, before you turn to discipline them. A father, for example, may throw out his daughter because she got pregnant out of wedlock. Such an action would further expose the girl to the fox already trying to destroy her.

      "Psalm 119:130 says: <i>“The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple”.</i>Therefore, when God sends a word to you, what He is sending to you is light. A particular word of God can enter into your spirit. You might have been hearing it before, you might have read it a thousand times, but all of a sudden, that particular word of God jumps to you and you know, this is the solution to your problem.<br><br>A man who was very wealthy fell on so hard a time that he decided to commit suicide. He planned on that day to go to Church and dance so much as if celebrating his departure. When he got to the Church, the preacher was talking about Shedrack, Meshack and Abednego. The preacher explained that the Hebrew boys believed God would deliver them though they did not know how He would do it, and He did deliver them. That was all the man needed to hear and he thought to himself, “My situation is so bad, I don’t see how it can improve, but I don’t need to know how, I just know it will improve”. He decided not to kill himself anymore and the day he was sharing his testimony, he had just bought 14 cars for his workers. All he heard was a word. When the word of God comes to you, suddenly, light comes and that light chases away every form of darkness in your life.<br><br>All that you need to be healed and to live in divine health is just a word from God (Psalm 107:20). When God sends a word to you, it will come with the power and faith that you need to receive it and walk in it with confidence. Once you have received it with faith, then it becomes your reality.<br><br>What area of your life are you not yet walking in dominion as a child of God? You need to ask God to send His word to you concerning that area. In whatever area of your life that you have been timid before, a word from God will turn you into a lion in that area. You will become indomitable. This is why you should not miss your personal quiet times every morning and fellowships with brethren. You never can tell when God will send that word that will liberate you forever.",

      "God wants the body of Christ to always go from glory to glory. He wants it such that men and women of God have followers who operate in greater measures of anointing. That is why He said we should make disciples of nations (Matthew 28:19-20). As powerful as He was during His earthly ministry, before leaving He said:<i> “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father”</i> (John 14:12). No matter how greatly anointed your spiritual father is, God can anoint you more than him. You may be asking, “Are you saying that God can anoint me more than you?” Yes, indeed He can.<br><br>There was a woman who was in the Redemption camp when she received a call that her daughter had died while giving birth to a set of twins, both of whom had also died. After the programme, she went to the hospital and took with her a bottle of anointing oil that we had blessed, dropped a little of the oil in the twins’ mouths and said, “Don’t waste my time; come back to life” and they both came back to life. The body of her daughter was just about to be wheeled to the mortuary at the time, she stopped the hospital staff, poured a little anointing oil on the daughter, placed an anointed handkerchief on her head and the daughter also came back to life. She raised three people from death in one day. Even I haven’t raised more than one person from death in one day yet. Thus, you can do even more than your Father-in-the Lord. For all my children, the anointing on you will be much more than the one on me, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The reason we have had many great men of God in the past and no one to carry that same measure of anointing now is simply that many people are not willing to serve the anointed with all their hearts. Not many people can carry the same burden that their Fathers-in-the-Lord do. If your soul is occupied with the world, you cannot carry the anointing of your Father-in-the-Lord whose focus is completely on doing the will of God. Elisha got a double portion of Elijah’s anointing because he remained loyal and committed to the latter.",

      "To enlarge means to make bigger, implying that anytime there is enlargement, there must be two important factors involved - the object to be enlarged and the fellow who is going to be the enlarger. You are the one to be enlarged and the enlarger is the One spoken about in Genesis 1:28: <i>“And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”</i><br><br>The Scripture above didn’t say, “Be fruitful and increase”, but rather “Be fruitful and multiply”. This implies that if you are truly fruitful, then you will multiply; that is the true meaning of fruitfulness. God is not interested in addition, but rather, multiplication. You must seek to multiply over and over again. Why then are many people, including Christians satisfied with the status quo? Some are satisfied with getting a little increase in their salary every two years, some pastors are satisfied with just sitting over one parish of their Church with the same number of people for several years. This is as good as a taboo, especially when you consider the status of the Person who said, “Be fruitful and multiply”. There is a popular saying that goes thus: “Garbage in, garbage out”. Your current results are a reflection of the work you have been putting in. If you really want to multiply, then you must multiply your efforts too; you must multiply everything you have been doing, in order to get the desired results. If you do this, you would soon realise that your results have also multiplied.<br><br>Multiplication is in levels; some people will multiply thirty-fold, some sixty-fold and some a hundred-fold and so on. Multiply your input in proportion to how much increase you desire in your output. Multiply your input in prayers, in work, in study, in giving and so on. Just before the Lekki ’98 crusade where we had the largest religious gathering in the world at the time, I told my partners that if I thought I had fasted before, I was only joking because for the result we were trusting God for in that programme, I needed to fast far more than before. Luke 6:38 says that it is with the same measure that you have given that it will also be given to you. ",

      "The Christian race is a marathon, not a sprint. Some of us thought that Jesus would come within a few years after we got born again. Although He hasn’t come yet, believe me honestly, His coming is far nearer than it was then; He will soon be here. Since this race is a marathon, then it means that in addition to strength, you would also need endurance if you want to run the race successfully. Endurance comes by the special grace of God which He makes available to keep you standing until the end. These are the works of grace.<br><br>When I became born again, we were taught that there were three works of grace that God makes available to Christians - Salvation, Sanctification and the Holy Ghost Baptism.  I decided to check further and discovered that there are at least 7 steps in this process. From our Bible reading, you will discover that the first thing God says He will do even before Salvation is to gather His own together (John 6:44). You cannot be saved unless God draws you first.<br><br>When I came to The Redeemed Christian Church of God, it was because I had a problem my education could not solve and God used that problem to draw me to Himself. When somebody is talking about their salvation experience and they say, “I found the Lord”, they are only speaking from their limited knowledge. God was never missing; it is He who found you (John 15:16). This is why, if you are truly saved now, you should always thank God for the salvation of your soul.<br><br>It is however, possible that God could be drawing a man, yet the man refuses to come to Him. The end of such people is always disastrous. There was a popular chief God sent me to preach salvation to and every time I visited, he would say, “Not yet”. One day, he had a stroke that rendered him unconscious; I was called to pray for him and within one hour, he was restored to perfect health as if nothing at all had gone wrong.  This time I told him, “I feel God is giving you a last chance; will you give your life to Christ now?” Again, he said, “Not yet”. The next time I heard about him, he was dead. If God is drawing you to Himself and you keep refusing, you are telling Him clearly that you prefer hell to heaven. You had better surrender to Him now for your own good. ",

      "We identified the first work of grace to be God’s call to man for salvation. Once a person heeds this call and surrenders all to God, He moves on to the next work of grace - salvation.<br><br><b>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</b><br><br>1 John 1:7<br><br>Salvation is the point at which God blots out all your sins of the past and gives you a clean slate to start with. Many people find it hard to believe that God can cleanse their sins completely, but that is the exact truth. It doesn’t matter how badly you have sinned, Jesus can make you a new creature in Him. That is why the salvation experience is referred to as being ‘born again’. The devil has no grounds to accuse you of any past sin.<br><br>When you become saved, the first thing you will notice is that you experience peace like a river. This is because sin is a weight on your heart. Matthew 11:28-30 says after Jesus draws you and you come to Him, if you decide to take His yoke on yourself, He will take your burden and then you will have rest. The burden He takes from you is the burden of sin. Once that burden is lifted, your soul will be at peace. This peace is difficult to describe but when you experience it, you will know. If you have never experienced it before, then you need Jesus to save you and cleanse you from all sins. If you don’t have that peace anymore, you need to run back to your Saviour and rededicate your life to Him.<br><br>The second thing that marks the salvation experience is joy – the joy of the Lord. It will be impossible to hide this type of joy. The Monday after I gave my life to Christ, when I got to work, my Head of Department could practically see that I was radiating with joy. He asked if I had attended a party during the weekend. I told him I hadn’t attended any party, but I got the invitation to a wedding where I am the bride and Jesus is the groom. Once your sins are cleansed, your soul begins to rejoice. Anyone who backslides always notices that the joy they used to feel is gone. That is why David said in Psalm 51:12 that God should restore unto him the joy of his salvation. ",

      " We looked at the first two works of grace over the past two days and would be discussing the third work of grace today. The third work of grace happens after we have become children of God through the blood of Jesus cleansing us of all sins. The Lord at this stage, brings closer to Himself a select group. Matthew 22:14 says: <i>“For many are called, but few are chosen”</i>. This chosen few become what I would like to call the favorites of the Almighty God.<br><br>In the olden days, a king could have as many wives as he wanted, but there would still be one who would be his favourite. After salvation, there is always a select group of people who are just closer to God than everyone else. They are not like everyone else - they love God more; they serve Him more committedly. These are the ones who don’t come for what they can get; they serve Him whatever the cost. We call these people the Sanctified - people who are set apart for God.<br><br>Now, these people who are sanctified are given a new heart. Ezekiel 36:26 says: <i>“A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh”</i>. Many Christians never get to this level before they die and that is a pity. This is why we have so many Christians, yet, only a few are actually living holy.<br><br>The one that the Almighty God is going to set apart for Himself must be completely dead to the world. He must be put to sleep so soundly that there is nothing anybody can do that will distract his attention from God. These are the ones who will say like Paul in Galatians 2:20:<br><br><i>“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”</i><br><br>In the past, one of the ways by which we identified these sanctified people is that they are difficult to annoy. They are so occupied with their Groom - the Lord Jesus Christ, that there is very little you can do to offend them. Sanctified people are those who will suffer any wrong and take it calmly, rather than allow an unbeliever to say, ‘And you call yourself a child of God’. ",

      "As we continue with our study of the works of grace, we will consider the baptism of the Holy Spirit today. After God has enabled you to do His will voluntarily without being forced, He will then baptise you in His Spirit. When we were younger Christians, we were told, “You must be sanctified before you begin to ask for baptism in the Holy Spirit”. The Holy Ghost baptism is very dangerous, so much so that it can even destroy a person.<br><br>In those days, people gave offerings voluntarily - nobody needed to preach to you. We were willing to spend and be spent for the One who saved us; He had given us a new heart - a heart of flesh. After you have become sanctified, God can then trust you with His Holy Spirit and power. The Holy Spirit cannot live in a heart that is still stubborn, unruly and disobedient<br><br>.Baptism in the Holy Spirit comes with power (Acts 1:8) and thus, you need to be sanctified before that can happen. Beloved, the Holy Spirit is like a bomb. Nobody will give a bomb to someone who is not broken. When you join the army, they take you through a series of training programmes and by the time they are finished with you, you would almost be like a zombie. You would begin to do everything they ask of you without questions. When you become a Christian, you have joined the army of the Lord and until you are thoroughly broken, He won’t give you His power. Don’t mind those who pretend to be operating in the power of God while their behaviours are not portraying Christ; Simon the sorcerer could also perform some magic. If you want the true power of God, you must be sanctified first. Carnality must be gone from your life, so that He can release His power to you.<br><br>When the baptism in the Holy Ghost happens, one of the primary evidences will be speaking in tongues. No one will have to tell you what to say. The day I was baptised in the Holy Spirit, it was the Lord Himself who drove my car home because I wasn’t in this world; all I knew was that I had no control over my tongue. That kind of true power is available for you, provided you are sanctified. After receiving this power, you then become a witness to Him as He said in Acts 1:8.  ",

      " Having the Holy Spirit does not mean that you have arrived - not at all. He gave you the Holy Spirit for a reason and that is to witness according to Acts 1:8. A witness is someone who tells others about what they have seen or heard. When God asks you to witness, He is saying you should tell people about the things you have heard and seen about Him. To really prove that what you are telling them is true, He gives you gifts of the Spirit. This is the work of grace that comes after the Holy Ghost baptism.<br><br>There are basically nine gifts of the Holy Spirit, as seen in 1 Corinthians 12:7-11 and they can be grouped into three. One group is called the revelation gifts. The revelation gifts consist of the Word of Wisdom, Word of Knowledge and Discerning of Spirits. When you hear someone say something about you that he or she could not possibly have known except God told him or her, that is the Word of Knowledge. For example, while I am preaching many times, God tells me things about people in the congregation and I announce it starting with, “There is someone here…”. Despite not knowing these people,  what I announce is usually the exact situation of the person involved - that is the Word of Knowledge at work. God knows all things and from time to time reveals them to those whom He has given this gift to. It is a powerful gift of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>There is another group of gifts called the Power Gifts – the Gift of Faith, the Gift of Healing and the Gift of the Working of Miracles. Then of course there are three others called the Vocal Gifts - these are the Gifts of Prophecy, diverse kinds of Tongues and the Interpretation of Tongues. The Almighty God can give you any of these 9 gifts after you are baptised in the Holy Spirit and have started working for Him. Interestingly, 1 Corinthians 12:31 says: <i>“But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.”</i><br><br>The only place in the Bible where you are allowed to be covetous is when it comes to the gifts of the Holy Spirit. After my Holy Spirit baptism, I asked God for all the gifts and He answered me. I give Him glory and honour that when you ask Him, He is more than willing to give. ",

An example of this is when a believer becomes proud because God performs miracles through him or her. Matthew 7:22-23 says: <i>“Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity”.</i> They had the gifts of prophecy and working of miracles, but God didn’t even know them. That is because though the gift was present in their lives, the fruit was absent. This is why you must never be satisfied with just having the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The fruit is more important than the gift, so you must ensure that you experience this important work of grace.<br><br>According to Galatians 5:22-23, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance. While you may already be working miracles, God is asking you to move higher. You may be performing miracles, yet are difficult to live with; you might get the gifts and still end up in hell. What will it profit you if you are a powerful evangelist but get left behind when the rapture takes place? Of what use is your anointing if you will end up in the same place as the devil? Anointing is good and I love it, but I don’t want to be anointed and then become a candidate of hell; God forbid. Jesus Christ said if you want to know those who will go to heaven, look out for the fruit of the Holy Spirit in them, not the gifts.<br><br><b>Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</b><br><br>Matthew 7:20-21<br><br>Don’t be deceived by the anointing of God already at work in your life. If you don’t manifest the fruit of the Spirit, you will not enter the Kingdom of heaven. ",

      " Over the past six days we learnt that God first draws you to Him and if you yield, He saves you by cleansing you with His blood. Sanctification and baptism in the Holy Spirit then follows, after which you receive the gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit. We will round off this study today by looking at how the Lord brings His children to perfection.<br><br>Our Lord Jesus said in Matthew 5:48, <i>“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”</i> In this context, perfection can be easily understood as when you only do things that edify. There are some things that may not be regarded as sin in themselves but then, they are not edifying. The place of perfection is when you avoid such things. This is when you begin to see some things that, though lawful, are not expedient for you to do (1 Corinthians 10:23).<br><br>For example, gossip may not be viewed as a sin, but does it edify you? Only a few people get to this stage in their walk with Christ - where they have gone beyond just what is sin and what is not, engaging only in things that edify them while avoiding things that don’t.<br><br>One of the signs that a person is experiencing this work of grace is that the fellow will pay attention to doctrine. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us that all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is therefore profitable, amongst other things, for doctrine which will lead you to perfection. Thus, even when you have been performing miracles, signs and wonders, you still need to pay attention to doctrine because <i>“Forever O Lord, thy word is settled”</i> (Psalm 119:89).<br><br>God is therefore saying to you, whatever level you are in now, “Come up higher”. Don’t just stay on the level of being cleansed of all your sins, move to being sanctified. Don’t think that the moment you can speak in tongues, then you have arrived; go on to receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit and then ensure you also produce the fruit thereof, so that the gifts don’t destroy you. And lastly, be amongst the rare set of people who are made perfect (Matthew 5:48). You have to keep going higher until you become perfect, such that people would look at you and say that you are a true child of God. ",

      "In our Bible reading for today, David said he waited patiently for the Lord. This statement could be interpreted to mean ‘I waited for God’s time’. This is because God has a timetable He works with as we see in Psalm 102:13.<br><br>This however, does not mean that God is bound by time. For example, in Isaiah 38:8 when the king wanted a sign that God had heard his prayer, the prophet said confidently that the sun would move 10 degrees backwards and it was so. In Joshua 10:12-14, God helped Joshua stop the sun from setting so the Israelites could finish off their enemies.  In John 11:21, Mary told Jesus that He came too late as her brother was already dead, but the Lord reversed the irreversible and Lazarus came back to life. God can reverse time for your sake too, just ensure you wait patiently on Him in faith.<br><br>‘I waited patiently’ could also mean, “God, you are my last bus stop. I am not going anywhere else until You answer me”. In Genesis 32:24-29, Jacob refused to let the angel go unless he blessed him. It may interest you to know that God likes it when you refuse to let Him go until He blesses you. In Luke 18:1-8, Jesus taught about persistent prayers using the example of a widow who would not let a wicked judge rest until she got justice. He explained that if you stay put with God, you will get what you are asking for. The daughter of the woman in Matthew 15:22-29 was delivered of unclean spirits because her mother refused to leave Jesus alone, even when He told her to go away since she wasn’t a Jew.<br><br>David said after waiting patiently for the Lord, He inclined to him (Psalm 40:1). When God inclines His ear unto you, you can be sure that you would receive your miracle, because whenever God pays attention to someone, a miracle always follows. Wait patiently on God, He is never late.  ",

      "In Psalm 40:1, David said God inclined unto him and heard his cry - not his whisper, but his cry. A cry in this context is a prayer made with violence. Matthew 11:12 says, <i>“And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”</i><br><br>You must therefore be violent in your dealings with things of the Kingdom of heaven. In Mark 10:46-52, the kind of prayer that Bartimeous prayed is what we call a cry. There was a multitude there just like there are multitudes calling on God every minute, but in the midst of that multitude, one man cried and God inclined His ear to Him.<br><br>When you cry to God and He inclines His ear to you, He lifts you out of the miry clay. Miry clay simply means a situation so bad that unless help comes from outside, you are done for. The more a person in quicksand struggles, the deeper he or she would go into it. It is a situation where there is nothing you can do on your own to be free. When in that kind of situation, you don’t whisper, you cry. There is a practical example in Mark 2:1-12, where a man paralysed from the neck down was brought to Jesus. Every part of his body was dead except the neck upwards. There was nothing any doctor could do for him, but thank God for Jesus Christ. When Jesus saw him, He said, “Arise” and he came out of the miry clay. In the name that is above every other, you will come out of the miry clay.<br><br>Another example is in 2 Kings 4:1-7, where the widow of the son of the prophet was so badly in debt, the creditors said they would sell her children within 24 hours if she didn’t pay. She didn’t whisper, she cried to the man of God. Before the 24 hours were up, she had more than enough to pay her debt. I pray for you that God will incline His ears to you today as you cry out to Him, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Whenever people cried unto the Lord again and again, He would eventually turn and attend to them. Let that be your disposition when you go to God in prayer. Don’t pray like a gentleman or lady, with finesse. Cry to Him with all your strength, and He will incline His ear to you.  ",

      "Many people are in the miry clay of life. A miry clay is a situation so terrible, you cannot get out of it by yourself; you need external help to get you out of it. When the doctor tells someone that they have done their best and there is nothing more they can do to make the fellow feel better, he knows that at that point, except God comes to his aid, he is finished. Thankfully, I have a God who specialises in lifting people out of the miry clay and placing their feet on the rock to stand firm (Psalm 40:2).<br><br>What do you do for the Almighty God to pull you out of the miry clay? The first thing is to realise that it is sin that brought you into the miry clay in the first instance. When the paralysed man was brought to Jesus in Mark 2:1-12, the first thing the Lord said to him was, “Your sins be forgiven you”. The word of God is clear: the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Sickness is an agent of death. You must repent and forsake your sins before you can come out of the miry clay. The Lord told the man at the pool of Bethesda, “Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee” (John 5:14). If you don’t get rid of sin in your life, you may never get out of that miry clay. David said in Psalm 66:18: <i>“If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:”</i> How can you be expecting an answer from God when He cannot even hear your prayers at all?<br><br>I was invited to Tunisia about 11 years ago to speak at the World Prayer Conference and I said, “Brethren, I have come to submit to you that God answers all prayers.” Some deep theologians called me aside and said that it is not true. Don’t let anybody deceive you, God answers prayers. He said, “Call on me and I will answer you” (Jeremiah 33:3). He didn’t say, “I may answer you”. The only variable there is, He can only answer the prayers He hears. If He doesn’t hear, how will there be an answer?  Isaiah 59:1-2 says clearly that it is our sins that prevent God from hearing us.<br><br>If you are still obeying God half-heartedly, change your ways. It is in your best interest to do so.   ",

      "Our God is the Most High (Ecclesiastes 5:8). Jesus’ name is higher than every other (Philippians 2:9), and this means all the problems you are currently facing are below Him. Every now and then, you need to shout the name JESUS so that your problem will hear it and flee. His throne is higher than any other because it is in the heavens, far above all principalities and powers. His army is bigger and stronger than any other because He controls all the hosts in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth. According to Philippians 2:9-11, not only is His name higher than any other, His influence is also in all the spheres because, in Heaven, on earth and underneath the earth, knees bow to Him. The fact that God is the Most High however, has certain implications. We will begin to discuss this today and over the next few days.<br><br>Firstly, being the Most High, He has the last say over every matter. If you have a case in a High Court and the judge finds you guilty, you can appeal the ruling. If the Appeal Court says you are guilty, you can appeal to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court says you are guilty,  the President may decide to grant you a state pardon. There is however, somebody higher than the President and that is the Almighty God. He is not a President, a Prime Minister, or a King. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. He is the King who decrees a thing and it stands fast (Psalm 33:9).<br><br><b>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</b><br><br>Matthew 10:28.<br><br>In Exodus 5:1-2, the world's greatest ruler then was Pharaoh. Moses relayed God’s message to him saying, “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness”. Pharaoh refused and said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go?” By the time God had finished with him, he was the one begging the people to go. If you disobey God, it means you love death (Proverbs 8:36). If you have any wisdom, you will fear the Most High and stay away from anything that can offend Him. ",

In Mark 2:1-12, the man brought in through the roof could not be healed - medically speaking, but he walked out healed when he came into the presence of the Most High. We are indeed privileged to serve a God who can overrule medical reports.<br><br>The Most High can also overrule death. In John 11:39-44, the Bible tells us that by the time Jesus got to the tomb of Lazarus, not only had Lazarus been dead for days, his corpse must also have already been stinking. His relatives believed it was already too late but the Most High spoke – completely overruling death and calling Lazarus back to life. Throughout Jesus’ earthly ministry, He never addressed death. When He was going to raise the daughter of Jairus, He didn’t use the word death at all; He said, “Little girl, arise”, and death had to let go.<br><br>The Most High can overrule demons.

The mother ran to me and I told her not to worry. The bride got pregnant, and gave birth safely in spite of all the evil the witches planned because the Most High had overruled them.

Isaiah 28:13 says that even if you have made any covenant that is not according to His will, once He overrules it, it will not stand. If there is any covenant between you and the devil, it is cancelled now, in Jesus’ name. Many years ago, a woman came to deliver her baby at our maternity centre in The Redeemed Christian Church of God. Apparently, because she had been barren for many years, she had uttered a statement  saying she didn’t mind dying, as long as she gave birth first. Now, she had gotten pregnant and didn’t want to die during childbirth, so she came to the Church’s maternity centre to deliver the baby. After being in labour for some days, the midwives informed me, so I called on the Most High to overrule that evil covenant she had made. He overruled it and a short while later, she gave birth safely.<br><br>The Most High overrules blood covenants too (Isaiah 49:24-26), so even if you have been initiated into a cult by blood covenant, the Lord will cancel it now, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Most High can even overrule hell. He can tell hell: “You cannot have this fellow”. Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:15 that he was originally the chief of sinners, but then he had an encounter with Jesus Christ and instead became a chief amongst the Apostles (2 Corinthians 11:5). I have always said, “If the Almighty God can use me, He can use anybody”. If He could take me from the path of hell and put me on my way to heaven, then whatever claim hell has over you is overruled right now, in Jesus’ name. You must note however, that you have a role to play in ensuring that hell’s claim over you is completely overruled. If the Most High decides to snatch you from the path to hell but you go back into sin, then you will be back on that destructive path.

      "Today, I want to introduce you to the other side of the Most High. You already know from previous discussions that He can overrule anybody, but did you know that He can also overrule Himself? In Isaiah 38:1-8, the Most High sent His Prophet to King Hezekiah to tell him that he was about to die. Hezekiah prayed to God to give him some more time on earth, and the Most High granted him 15 more years. The Prophet must have wondered, “But Lord, forever O Lord, Your word is settled” (Psalm 119:89), and God must have responded, “I am the One who said it. I am the One reversing it.” That is an example of God overruling Himself to answer a man’s prayers. He can also overrule Himself to punish a man. When you read 1 Samuel 2:30, you see Him overruling Himself to punish Eli.  This is where we need to be very careful.<br><br>In 1 Samuel 9:15-17, He chose Saul, who was the least in the least of the tribes in Israel, to be king. However, Saul became arrogant and God decided to reject him. At the end of the day, God sent a tormenting spirit to him and then made sure that he and his sons died on the same day. I am sure that if Saul knew that he would end up that way, he would never have disobeyed God.<br><br>The Most High is a wonderful friend to have. When He is on your side, He can overrule anybody or anything that is against you, but He is a very dangerous enemy. If He was once your friend and becomes your enemy, you are in trouble. This is why I want to appeal to you again to surrender your life to Him. The Most High is not someone you toy with. He is not someone you can cheat or deceive, He knows all things. He knows those who pretend to belong to Him but are still doing the will of the devil. Before He changes His mind, I beg you to surrender to Him and let Him be your friend for life. If you claim that He is your Lord, serve Him in total surrender. Serve Him with all your heart and in sincerity. Worship Him in Spirit and in Truth, and the result will be beautiful. If however, you think you can play games with Him, He will show you that He is a Consuming Fire.  ",

      "God’s arms are everlasting (Deuteronomy 33:27), so when He begins to lift you, no one can bring you down. When human beings promote you, they never want to put you on the same level as themselves. In Genesis 39:1-5, Potiphar promoted Joseph and put him in charge of everything in his house, but he was still a slave.<br><br><b>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</b><br><br>1 Samuel 18:4.<br><br>Jonathan gave David many gifts because he loved him but did not give him his shoes. In those days, no matter how much you give to a man, you can collect those things back if you don’t give him your shoes (Ruth 4:7-8).  Also, servants never wore shoes. Thus, Jonathan was telling him, “I love you greatly, but don’t forget that I am a prince and you are an ordinary citizen in this kingdom”.<br><br>Another thing you can learn from the story of Joseph is that if human beings promote you, they can also bring you down. It is the same Potiphar who made Joseph the head of all his slaves who later threw him in prison. Those shouting ‘Hosanna’ today may shout “Crucify him” tomorrow. When God decided to promote Joseph, He brought him to a level so high that even Potiphar – his former slave master, had to bow before him. The Most High will promote you and very soon, all those who have been oppressing you will bow before you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>The Almighty God took David - who was a shepherd boy, made him a king and kept on promoting him until he became the father of the King of kings (Revelations 22:16). This is a classic example of God lifting a fellow with His everlasting arms.<br><br>Do you know that if God decides to promote you, even after you are dead, the promotion continues? God however, will not lift the proud in His everlasting arms. You must surrender your life totally to Jesus and humble yourself before Him if you want Him to promote you (1 Peter 5:6). ",

      " In our Bible reading, Jesus was in the boat, yet there was a storm. This implies that Jesus can be in a person’s life, and a storm will still rage. Many think that once they are born again, they become a no-go-area for storms. That is not true; if anything, the devil will try harder to test your strength in Christ. Jesus Christ said it clearly in John 15:19, <i>“If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you”.</i><br><br>The mere fact that you are a child of God is enough to attract storms, but don’t worry; as long as Jesus is in your life, all you have to do is stir up His gift in you, and the storm will cease. If you are a child of God, Jesus is already in you, and the Bible says in 1 John 4:4 that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world. There can be a giant in you, but the giant can be sleeping until you wake Him up. 2 Timothy 1:6 says that there is a gift of God in you, and you have to stir it up. Psalm 50:14-15 says that if you come into the presence of God with thanksgiving, you can then call upon Him in the day of trouble and He will deliver you. Call on Him until He arises for you, because it is written in Psalm 68:1 that when God arises, His enemies scatter.<br><br>You can get the Almighty God to arise for you by prayer. In Acts 12:1-10, when Herod took James, the Church did not pray, and so James was killed. By the time Peter was arrested, the Church had learnt their lesson and thus prayed, getting the Lord to arise for them to still that storm. If you refuse to pray, the storm can overwhelm you, but if you pray, then you will win against the storm no matter how much it rages.<br><br>You can also cause Him to arise for you through praise. In Mark 10:46-52, when Bartimaeus was calling on Jesus, the Lord kept hearing, “Jesus, thou son of David…”, so He stopped to attend to Him. When you praise Him, He will arise for you. If you know how to call God His names in line with who He really is, He will pay attention to your situation and still any storm that rises against you. ",

I said, “Okay”. The next time I saw my son, he looked very unhealthy. He said the witch doctor got some of his customers, who were police officers, to arrest him because his prayers were disturbing him. The police locked him up for days, and the mosquitoes in the cell dealt with him.

You must rebuke  sickness in your body. Hosea 4:6 says, <i>“My people perish for lack of knowledge”.</i> Now that you know the truth, you can tell sickness, “How dare you attack me, a child of the Original Physician? My Daddy says in Exodus 15:26 that He is the Lord that healeth me, so I am healed in Jesus’ name”.<br><br>When you know who you are in Christ, it affects how you behave. If you are the son of a messenger, you would talk differently from the child of the President. Your Father is not just the President - He is the President of all the presidents in the whole world (Psalm 24:7-10). He is the One about whom Philippians 2:9-11 says that, at His name, every knee bows. It is unfortunate that many Christians have the name but don’t use it. You must rebuke demons. Tell them, “How dare you fool around with me. I am the child of the Lord of hosts”. If you do that, you will get every demon out of your household today. The Bible made it clear that if you are truly a child of the living God, you shouldn’t even fail. Philippians 4:13 says you can do ALL things through Christ who strengthens you.<br><br>You can rebuke the devil Himself. James 4:7 says if you submit yourself to God, you will resist the devil, and he will flee from you. When you know who you really are in Christ, your confidence shows in how you pray.

Some people around me then tried to caution me, saying no one would want to help me financially if I kept saying such things, but I never relented. I wasn’t bothered because I was not relying on man for help and I often made this clear to anyone who cared to listen. Look how far He has brought me now. I put all my faith in God, and declared my way into the wealth that God had already prepared for me. You can do so too. Stop saying you are broke. Stop saying things are hard.

He said in Matthew 6:33 that you should seek His kingdom and righteousness first. In Psalm 10:4, the Bible describes those who do not seek God and have Him in their thoughts as proud. In Deuteronomy 26:2, God said  that your very first harvest should be given to Him. He wants to be your number one or nothing at all to you. In fact, one of His names is ‘Jealous’ (Exodus 34:14).<br><br>Now, when God sees that you always put Him first and you have honoured Him, then He will begin to work out a befitting reward for you. In Proverbs 3:9-10, the Bible says: <i>“9Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 19So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine”.</i> In our Bible reading for today, Elijah told the widow of Zarephath to prepare his meal first before making that of herself and her son. Some other women would have said, “Prophet, did you not hear that there is only one meal left? If I prepare that one for you, there will be nothing left to prepare for me and my son”. Instead of saying that, she honoured God in the life of the Prophet in that difficult situation and in return, she never lacked food again. While the entire nation was starving, she had food in abundance. That is what happens when you put God first.<br><br>I was in Ilesha, holding a crusade many years ago when my Professor took my PhD thesis to the external examiner. Normally they post it, but he bought a ticket and took it. If you ask all those who got their PhDs back then, they will tell you that it usually takes months for external examiners to invite  PhD candidates for an oral examination. While I was busy in Ilesha doing the will of God, my Professor took my thesis to the external examiner and said, “I am not going back until you read this”. After the external examiner read it, he said “Go and give the boy his PhD”. If you do the will of God first, He will take care of all your needs.  When you honour Him and put Him first in all you do, what you will get in return will be a multiplication of what you sacrificed for Him.",

They couldn’t deliver the child and thus referred him to the Lord Jesus, who said, “O ye of little faith”. The man said, “I believe, but help thou my unbelief”.

One day during the convention, out of desperation, I said, “One day will come when you will be able to come to the Convention without bringing any money at all”. When we finished that night, and I got back to my office to pray, the Lord spoke to me, “Son, when do you want that to happen?” I said, “One of these days” and He responded, “Why not from now?” At that time we were about 10,000 people. How would I feed 10,000 people for one week? The Lord said, “Announce to the entire congregation that you will feed them next convention”. I said, “Daddy, I’ve never disobeyed You before, but this one? I can’t tell them”. He didn’t put any pressure on me, so the Convention ended and everybody left, but they came back the following month for the Holy Ghost Service and God repeated it. I said, “Lord, my faith can’t carry it”, and He said to me, “Son, you are about to lose a miracle”. I therefore announced, “Brethren, next year, don’t bring any money for feeding,  you will be fed”. That was over 20 years ago, and God has not failed once.<br><br>You may think I am a man of great faith, but the truth is that my Daddy is the One who helps my little faith, so I depend entirely on Him.

      "In our Bible reading, Jesus’ disciples woke Him up, and He stilled the storm. Have you imagined what would have happened had He not been in the boat? Life is full of storms, and except God helps you, such storms can drown you.<br><br>No matter how smart you are, there is one storm you cannot escape: the storm of death. Don’t be deceived’ death will make anyone who isn’t in Christ fearful. David could say, <i>“Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me”</i> (Psalm 23:4) because he was on the Lord’s side.  If the Lord is not with you in your boat and the storm comes, who will you call upon?<br><br>Storms can come suddenly, without notice. Once while on a plane to London, there was a particular man who had a golden walking stick.  From time to time, he would get up and show off his golden walking stick as he walked to and from the bathroom. Suddenly, the captain announced, “Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a little problem as we currently cannot land the plane”. The man with the golden walking stick now really needed to go to the bathroom; but as he stood up to go, the hostess asked him to remain seated. Obviously terrified, he refused to remain in his seat and for a moment, I too was afraid. I then said to my Daddy, “But Lord, You didn’t tell me this is the end”.  He responded saying, “No, it’s not the end. I want to talk to you, and I know that as soon as you land, you will be kept busy, but we need to talk”. As soon as I heard His voice, His peace came to me. After the Lord finished talking to me, the plane landed without any problem. Had I not already been His child that day, I would not have had any right to call upon Him in the storm and I would have been terrified like just any other person.<br><br>If He is not in your boat, there would be nobody to call upon for deliverance in the midst of a storm. It is only when you have Him in your boat that you would be able to say, “Christ in me the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27). ",

      "Do everything in moderation. The fact that you have enough money to buy as much food as you like does not mean you should eat every time. Some people used to fast when they were poor but as soon as some money came into their hands, fasting became history. Even if you don’t want to fast for spiritual reasons, you need to fast for the sake of your health.<br><br>Truly, you may have a lot to do but that doesn’t mean you should not find a way to spend quality time with your family. Don’t let success destroy the great things of life. Money is supposed to improve your quality of life, not worsen it. That you now have a housemaid or other domestic staff does not mean you should not exercise your body anymore. Every now and then, you still need to engage in some household chores and physical activities.<br><br>When some people make a little money, they start disrespecting other people they deem to be less fortunate. If you see a rich and popular fellow who doesn’t respect elders, you have seen someone who is not interested in living long. King Saul became wealthy and influential, so he stopped honouring Prophet Samuel. The result of that was his life becoming so miserable that he begged to be killed (1 Samuel 31:4). Samson thought because he was strong and influential, he could be with any woman he wanted, even against the advice of his parents and ended up being captured by his enemies. Don’t let the power that comes with money and success get you to destroy yourself.<br><br>The word of God does not teach us to lead a carnal life that pleases the flesh (Romans 8:13). Don't let comfort bury you before your time. Put your flesh under to ensure that it is not indulging in things that are not beneficial to you. Believe me honestly, if you always do whatever you feel like, your flesh will begin to rule you. If you let money, success or fame get into your head, the end will be disastrous. There are more successes to be achieved in the future, but you can only reach them if you are temperate with the ones you have already gotten. ",

      "I was merely a mathematician before God anointed me as a pastor. What would a mathematician possibly have to say that can profit you if God is not speaking through him? My life and ministry are built on what God says. My ears are always open to Him because when He speaks, power is at work. Ecclesiastes 8:4 says where the word of a king is, there is power. In The Redeemed Christian Church of God, we have seen great miracles - the dead coming back to life, blind eyes opening, women without wombs conceiving and delivering babies, and many other great testimonies, only because God speaks and power follows.<br><br>Believe me honestly, the only way to live an abundant life is to be able to hear God’s voice. I pity people who cannot hear or do not even know God. A believer that cannot hear God cannot work miracles, neither can he or she escape the traps of the devil.<br><br>John 6:68 says it clearly:<br><br><b>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</b><br><br>You cannot live without the spoken word of God. As a matter of fact, man was created to live by the word of God (Mathew 4:4). This is why the Bible must be your daily companion. The Bible is my favourite book because it has made me relevant to my generation. I will continue to read It so that God can do more in and through me.<br><br>You must also ensure that you choose carefully those you listen to. If you can hear God but listen to people who cannot, they will surely mislead you. Who are the people you go to for advice? Who are the people you depend on for correction? Proverbs 13:20 says a companion of fools shall be destroyed.<br><br>If your heart is pure and you haven't heard from God, you need to pray until God opens your ears to hear Him. Set yourself apart and seek to hear God (Habakkuk 2:1). Your soul will live only by what you hear. Your future and the fulfilment of your destiny depend on what you do with the instructions you receive from God. Hear life and live. ",

      "Today’s memory verse is probably one of the most loved verses in the Bible. It assures us Christians that our tomorrow will be all right. One young fellow came to me some time ago and said he had heard that I was a prophet of God. I said, “Well, I am actually a Pastor, but I do hear from God once in a while”. He said, “No, I was told that whatever you prophesy comes to pass”. I said, “God has been faithful. How can I help you?” He responded, saying, “Can you tell me my future?” I asked, “Are you born again?” He said, “No”. I told him, “Your future will be terrible”. He said, “But how do you know; you don’t even know my name. You haven’t even prayed”. I responded, “I don’t have to pray. It is written in Isaiah 3:11,<i>?“Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him”,</i> and the word of God is forever settled”. He then asked, “What if I had said I was born again?”. I told him, “Then I would have said your future will be great, according to Isaiah 3:10. If you have given your life to Christ, then you can say confidently, “My tomorrow will be all right”.<br><br>Believe it or not, your walk with God will determine your future. If you do some evil things now and think you have gotten away with them, you are deceiving yourself. Unless you repent, ask God for forgiveness and begin to live holy, you would still reap the consequences of your sins (Proverbs 6:12-15).<br><br>When the Bible says in Galatians 6:7 that God is not mocked and that whatsoever a man sows shall he reap, it is no joke. Many people are suffering rejection, poverty, near-success syndromes, diseases and other forms of trauma today because of the unrighteous things they did in the past. Many go from Church to Church seeking deliverance, whereas their deliverance is in them repenting and restituting. Some people are however, enjoying favour and good things because they have been living holy by the grace of God.<br><br>Your eternity is determined by the way you live while on earth. Jesus Christ is calling on you to surrender all to Him and live a righteous life in Him so that it indeed will be well with you.",

      "Isaiah 3:10 says it shall be well with the righteous because there are certain guaranteed blessings that righteous people enjoy. One of them is in Psalm 34:17: <i>“The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles”.</i><br><br>When you are living a life of holiness, anytime you cry to God, He would answer you speedily. This is as opposed to Isaiah 59:1-2, which says that people’s sins have prevented God from hearing them. David said clearly in Psalm 66:18: <i>“If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me”</i>. If you really want God to start hearing your prayers, then you must begin to live holy henceforth.<br><br>The blessings attached to living holy are numerous, as seen in today’s Bible text and memory verse. The children of righteous people are God’s responsibility; He takes care of their needs Himself. King David shared his observation about this in today’s memory verse.<br><br>The children of the righteous don’t have to depend on anybody to survive - God Himself makes sure that they don’t lack anything. This means that the best legacy and inheritance you can leave for your children is a holy lifestyle. This is so because God will ensure that they never lack. A classic illustration is in 1 Kings 11:11-12. David was a man after God’s heart, and God preserved his son – Solomon because of this.<br><br>It is better, however, to teach your children to live holy themselves even when you have gone to be with the Lord, so that their own children too will enjoy the preservation of the Lord.<br><br><b>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</b><br><br>Hebrews 1:9.Pursue righteousness and hate iniquity, so that you would see the manifestation of God’s glory upon your life and all that concerns you.",

      "Another major benefit of righteousness is that when evil is about to come for you, God takes you out of its way and substitutes you with an unbeliever. This is clearly stated in Proverbs 11:8: <i>“The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.”</i><br><br>This is called the Law of Substitution. When trouble wants to swallow the righteous, God will stop it and may put a substitute in his or her stead. There are many instances like this in Scripture. The people who threw Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego into the fire are the ones who died instead of the Hebrew boys who were saved by the Lord, because the furnace had to be fed (Daniel 3). The people who threw Daniel into the den of lions were also the ones the lions ate (Daniel 6).<br><br>Many years ago, a lady came to me for prayers. She said she had a dream that her husband, who was on a trip, would be brought back in a casket. I asked her if her husband was born again, and she said yes. We prayed about the dream and she left. After some time, I saw an obituary in the newspaper, and the fellow there had the same surname as this sister. The following Sunday in Church, I asked her about the obituary wondering if it was her husband. She responded saying it was not her husband but a relative of his. Death was coming for a believer; God revealed it to us so we could pray and when we did, He delivered the righteous from death, while an unbeliever became the substitute. There is no life insurance policy as good as living holy.<br><br>When you live a righteous life, you go through life with boldness, knowing that tomorrow will be alright. The Bible says in Proverbs 28:1: <i>“The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.”</i><br><br>If you believe that the policemen around you carrying revolvers are your protectors, wait until  they come across people carrying AK47s, then you will discover that you are on your own. The righteous are as bold as a lion because they know that they have God on their side. I want to challenge you to make a commitment today.

      "I am convinced that the question God asked Adam in our Bible reading is still very relevant today. Beloved, if God asks you that question today, what would be your sincere response?<br><br>To answer the question above sincerely, you must first ask yourself another question: “Where was I yesterday?” In this case, yesterday could be last week, last year or when you first got born again. After answering this question sincerely, you can then proceed to answer the question, “Where are you now?”<br><br>From the day of birth, we all begin a return journey to where we are from (Ecclesiastes 12:1-7). That is why, no matter how young you are, you are growing older day by day. You should therefore ask yourself regularly, “How far have I gone in fulfilling the purpose of my creation and salvation?”<br><br>Let us consider Samson.  He used to be a terror to the enemies but he ended up grinding corn in their prison. You should ask yourself, “Am I going on to greater heights, bearing fruits that abide? Am I increasing spiritually or decreasing? Am I spending more time in God’s presence than I used to or is the reverse the case? Am I winning more souls into the kingdom than I used to?”<br><br>You should also ask yourself, “Am I increasing financially or decreasing?” If there is a  decrease, could it be that you have been eating your seed? Or could it be that you are sowing sparingly (2 Corinthians 9:6)? Could it be that, because you have been defaulting in your tithe and offerings, you are working under a divine curse (Malachi 3:8-9)?<br><br>Beloved, as a child of God, it is important to ask yourself these questions from time to time. If you discover that you are not experiencing growth in any area of your life, please consider your ways (Haggai. 1:5-7). Ask the Holy Spirit to examine you and show you where you might have gotten it wrong. Ask Him for what to do to bring about a positive turn around in your life.<br>I pray you will fulfil God’s purpose for your life, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Jesus clearly loves names and according to our Bible reading today, His name is above all other names. Jesus calls Himself several names, some of which include ‘the Son of man’ (Matthew 18:11), ‘the Door’ (John 10:7), ‘Bread of life (John 6:35) and sometimes, He would even combine several names together. For example, He combined two names in John 11:25, three names in John 14:6, five names in Isaiah 9:6 and eight names in Revelation 1:8.<br><br>Everybody knows God as God, but when people get closer to Him; they begin to have other names for Him that are borne out of their experiences with Him. For example, in Genesis 22:14, Abraham came up with ‘Jehovah Jireh’ because God miraculously provided a lamb when he needed to make a sacrifice. In Exodus 17:15, Moses came up with ‘Jehovah Nissi’ because God helped them win the battle against the Amalekites and promised to wipe out their remembrance from under heaven.<br><br>God enjoys being called by names based on how He has revealed Himself to you. When I was younger, we used to have appellations amongst ourselves. For example, you could call your son Ade, but he could call himself Adesco. Thus, if you decided to send Ade on an errand and you want him to go cheerfully, you would call him Adesco. In the same way, when you are relating with God, and you want Him to do something for you, call Him a name that relates to that thing, and you will see Him move in accordance with the name you call Him. He is the One who established this Himself. In Exodus 15:26, when God was telling the Israelites that they would not get infected with the diseases of the Egyptians, He ended that statement by introducing one of His names to them; He said, “I am the Lord that healeth thee”. In Exodus 3:14, when Moses asked for God’s name, He introduced Himself as, “I am that I am”. This was a general name given to the Israelites because on their journey, they needed many dimensions of God. At different points, they needed God to provide for, protect and heal them, even to make a way for them. Thus, if you want God to move in a particular dimension, call Him by a name that relates to what you want Him to do for you.",

      "Someone may want to ask the Lord Jesus Christ, “Everybody calls You one name or the other; some say teacher, some say prophet. What would You love to be called?” In today’s memory verse, He said, <i>“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life”.</i> These are three mighty names, but for the next few days, we will be looking at Jesus as ‘The Way’.<br><br>Today, we will consider Jesus as the way to freedom. John 8:32 says: “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”<br><br>In John 8:36, the Bible says, <i>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”</i> When we talk about freedom, there are some people who think they are free but are not. Many influential people have problems that money cannot solve - problems completely beyond the power of science. However, there is no problem beyond the power of Jesus Christ. He is the way to freedom. There was a man in Mark 5:1-15 who was controlled by a legion of demons. Just one word from The Way, and all the demons left him.<br><br>here was a woman who had this peculiar condition that caused electrical currents to pass through her whenever any electronic appliance around her was switched on. If you switched on the electric iron, she would become hot while the iron remained cold. If you switched on the fan, the woman would start rotating. Once when she wanted to go to the hospital in a van, as soon as the driver started the engine, the current flowed from the battery, picked her up and threw her out of the vehicle. Due to this strange condition, electricity supply had to be cut off from her house.<br><br>I went to see this woman and told her I knew someone who could set her free. She immediately gave her life to Jesus, we prayed a simple prayer and when we turned on the fan, it rotated without affecting her in any way. She was set free by The Way.<br><br>The only way to obtain freedom is by surrendering your life completely to The Way.",

      "Jesus being The Way also implies that He is The Way out of problems. There are problems in this world that you cannot solve no matter how intelligent you are, but there is no problem that Jesus cannot solve. Jesus Christ is the way out of sorrow.<br><br>In our Bible text for today, we read of a widow whose only son died. Nobody needs to tell us that she was in sorrow. She had known days of joy. The day she gave birth to this boy, she must have had joy then, but then the devil came in and steadily began to change her joy to sorrow, first by killing her husband and then coming for her only son. I can assure you that as they were going towards the burial ground, she was getting deeper and deeper into sorrow because she knew that there were people amongst those following her, pretending to be weeping with her and saying in their hearts, “Why is your case so bad? Are you the only one in town? There must be something you have done wrong that God is punishing you for”, but then she met Jesus Christ and the tide turned. For the mere fact that you are reading this today, sorrow is banished from your life forever, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>I was invited to preach at a private event in Ikoyi some years ago. I was going to preach on the topic, “O that Man should praise the Lord”, but as I waited in the hostess’ living room before the event started and observed the splendour of the house, I thought to change my topic entirely.  I felt the hostess and her guests appeared to have everything they needed already but the Almighty God said I should talk to them about “You need a miracle”. I learnt later on that the woman had only one son who had gone so deeply into drugs that when his mother refused to give him extra money to buy them, he planted some in her bag when she was travelling to London so that she could be arrested at the airport. Everything seemed nice and beautiful on the  outside, but deep inside, there was sorrow.<br><br>That day as I preached, the young man gave his life to Jesus, and the mother from that day on knew joy. If you too want to have joy for the rest of your life, the only way is through Jesus Christ.  Let Him carry your burdens (Matthew 11:28).",

      "Jesus is the Way forward. In Luke 5:1-7, Peter had fished all night but caught nothing. He wasn’t lazy, but he was still considered a failure. When Jesus stepped into his boat however, all of a sudden, there was a way forward. Just like Peter, many people find themselves going around in circles. When Jesus steps into your boat, your forward motion would become accelerated.<br><br>One of my sons came to me and said, “Daddy, I’ve been on one spot for more than 12 years. I have applied to an organisation now and have been scheduled for an interview, so I need prayers to succeed”. I was about to pray for him when he said, “No, don’t pray, just say a word”, so I said, “Go, and the interview will go well.” He said amen and left. He returned the following day excited. “Daddy, I prepared for that interview like no man’s business. When I got there, all they asked me was, ‘When can you start?’ I told them I would start tomorrow”. I congratulated him and he said, “No, speak another word” and I did. The following day, he came again, trembling, “Daddy, I got to my new place of work and was told that their Managing Director just resigned; they then asked me to become the new Managing Director”. Again he asked me to speak another word, so I did. The following day, he was back. This time, he was almost speechless. “Daddy, they discovered that their Managing Director resigned because their competitor offered him double the salary they were paying, and since they don’t want me to leave, they doubled my salary”. I congratulated him again, and he said, “No, speak another word”. This time, I said jokingly, “Do you want to take the company over from the owners?”<br><br>When I was a lecturer in the University, I had a driver, but then, somehow, by the middle of the month, I would have become so broke that I would be borrowing money to fuel the car from this same driver whose salary I was paying. I was being relatively well paid but somehow, I wasn’t moving forward in life. I then met Christ and everything turned around - not because of any brilliance on my part, but rather simply because I gave my life to Christ and began to live holy.

      "Jesus is The Way upward. He said in John 12:32: <i>“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.”</i> Jesus is always drawing people upward. Believe me honestly, the only person who can truly promote you is Jesus Christ. If you don’t believe me, read Psalm 75:6-7:<br><br><b>For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</b><br><br>God is the promoter. If man lifts you, man will bring you down. In any case, man is limited in many ways. A man may want to lift you with his position, but what if he gets fired before he fulfils his promise? Who even told you that the fellow would be alive by the time you need his help? The only One who can guarantee your upward movement is God.  That is why He is the only real way upward.<br>When I was to turn 40 years old, I had a vision where God showed me two graphs. In mathematics, we call them parabolas. One was a head-up parabola, and the other was a head-down parabola. At the turning point of each of these parabolas was written 40. I knew clearly that this was referring to my 40th birthday. The Lord then asked me, “Which of these graphs do you prefer?” I chose the head-down parabola because it meant that at 40 years old, I would be at my lowest point and from there on, it would be upward movement as opposed to the other graph, which implied that I was at my highest point at 40. The Lord then said that if I wanted Him to keep promoting me, I had to let go of all my big titles and simply be addressed as ‘Pastor’. True to His word, since then, I have been going upwards.<br><br>Humility is key for anyone who wants Jesus to lift him or her higher. The Bible says:<br><br><b>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time</b>1 Peter 5:6<br><br>If you want God to promote you beyond your peers, you must surrender your life to Jesus Christ and emulate His humility.",

      "In today’s Bible reading, Jesus promised to come and take us to be with Him where He is. The question now is, “Where is He?” The disciples saw Him when He was ascending, so we can see from their account where He went in Acts 1:9-10: <i>“And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel”.</i><br><br>Clearly, Jesus ascended to heaven. Now, He said in John 14:6 that no one can get to the Father in heaven except through Him. This is very clear. Many people say there are many ways to heaven; that is a lie. Jesus is the one and only way to heaven. No religion or belief outside of Jesus Christ can get you to heaven.<br><br>Now, who are those whom Jesus Christ will take upwards to heaven when they leave this world? Ephesians 5:27 tells us: <i>“That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.”</i> The only people whom Jesus will take to heaven to be with Him are those who are without spot or wrinkle. If you are unholy, when you leave this earth, Jesus will not take you upward with Him to Heaven, and the other option is to go to hell.<br><br>There are many people who call the name of Christ now, but when they shut their eyes here on earth, they will wake up in hell. Your attendance in Church is not a guarantee of your entry into heaven; the fact that you are a zealous worker or even a Pastor does not mean that you will go to heaven. Only an intimate relationship with Jesus - The Way upward, can guarantee your entrance into heaven. Eternity is not something to play games with. Some will be spending eternity in heaven with Jesus and His angels, enjoying forever, while others will be spending eternity in the lake of fire with the devil and his demons, suffering forever. It is time to stop the pretence and truly surrender to Jesus. It is time to put religion aside and have a real relationship with Jesus Christ. It is time to stop being a Christian only on Sundays; let your lifestyle always reflect Jesus. It is time to be on the way to heaven, in all sincerity of heart.",

When Jesus and His disciples got to the tomb and He asked that the stone be rolled away, Lazarus’ sister said to Jesus that it was too late already. She was confident that if Jesus had come before her brother died, Jesus would have healed him. Her statement also implies that she felt that if Jesus had arrived when he had just died like in the case of Jairus’ daughter, or just before he was buried like in the case of the widow of Nain’s son, Jesus would have been able to raise Lazarus from the dead, but since he was already dead and buried for 4 days; there is no way out. Jesus Christ, the Way where there is no way however, simply asked that the stone be rolled away and then called Lazarus out of the tomb.<br><br>There was one of my sons whose country I was visiting. I had expected to see him at the airport, but he wasn’t there. I asked after him and was told that he was in the hospital dying. I went to see him in the hospital and was taken to a special ward where hopeless cases – people who the doctors were sure would soon die, were kept.  I prayed for him that Saturday and by the following Wednesday, my son was discharged, completely whole. Beyond his healing, however, everyone in that ward with him also got discharged that day.<br><br>There comes a time when a person could look at all the options in front of him, and none of them would look like a way out of his problem. At that time, the only One who can make a way where there is none is Jesus. When the Israelites were between the Red Sea and the Egyptian army, humanly speaking, there was no right decision to take. They would die if they turned to fight the Egyptians because the Israelites had no military training or weapons. The Red Sea was in front of them, so there was no question of moving forward. It was clear that their fate was in the hands of Pharaoh, but that was before The Way stepped in. The moment Moses cried to God about their situation, a way was created where there had been none and the Egyptians were destroyed in their stead.<br><br>Surrender all to Jesus today and call upon Him to make a way for you where there is no way, and He will answer you.",

I can only describe it as a place of endless sufferings because it is a land of unimaginable horrors. All the residents of this horrific place are in constant suffering for eternity. That place is called hell fire (Mark 9:47). The first thing you need to know about hell fire is that it is a place of torment. Luke 16:23 describes the experience of a man in hell as follows: <i>“And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.”</i><br><br>All occupants of hell are tormented non-stop. In Mark 9:48, Jesus tells us some of the things that torment them: <i>“Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.”</i><br><br>The passage does not say ‘the worm’ does not die, but ‘their worm’. In other words, worms will be coming out of the body of the people there, and these worms cannot be killed. They just keep eating their victims up. Also, there is an unquenchable fire there that keeps burning the occupants of hell non-stop. In Matthew 25:41, Jesus said the fire is everlasting. Revelations 14:11 says the smoke of their torment in hell goes up forever and that there is no rest day or night; the torment just goes on without stopping for eternity. A drop of water will be a luxury to the people in hell (Luke 16:24). Can you imagine such torment? There is no nightmare that can compare to the actual experience of hell fire.<br><br>There are many passages in the Bible where Jesus described hell as a place where there will be a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Even assuming that the torments are the cause of their wailing, what then would make them gnash their teeth? Gnashing of teeth is something people do when they regret their action or inactions. The people in hell will be gnashing their teeth for eternity, regretting that they did not live holy lives when they were on earth. You are still here on earth, so you have the opportunity that those people will give anything to have again. You have the opportunity to repent and start living holy now. If you delay until it is too late, you would remember this message in hell and wish you had listened. Choose wisely.",

      "There are many preachers today who say that once a person is saved, he or she is forever saved,  so the fellow would go to heaven even if he or she keeps committing sin. That is a big lie. My own Bible says clearly in Romans 6:15: <i>“What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.”</i><br><br>Real grace enables you to live holy rather than permit you to commit sin. What the grace of God does is give you the ability to live above the dictates of your flesh. It is by grace that you are saved (Ephesians 2:4-5). After that, the grace of God that <i>brought you salvation will then teach you to live holy. “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world”.</i> This is the true work of grace that the Bible talks about.<br><br><b>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.</b><br>2 Timothy 1:9<br><br>Please ignore anyone who tells you that the grace of God allows you to commit sin. That is a message from the devil, carefully put together to send many people to hell. The devil knows that no sinner will enter into heaven, so he carefully crafted this message for Christians to ensure that they continue to sin even after responding to the altar call, but he will fail over you, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>I have had big men of God argue with me over this subject and each time, I tell them, “Let us assume that you are correct, and once I have given my life to Christ before, heaven is sure even if I keep committing sin. That means if rapture takes place or we both die, we will both go to heaven. But if you are wrong, that means if rapture takes place now or we both die, I will go to heaven, and you will go to hell. Either way, I am still correct. I would rather choose the safe path”. What about you?",

      "When there is an evangelistic outreach the most beautiful part of the Scripture is usually preached so that unbelievers in attendance can be won for Jesus.  The preacher would typically tell the congregation that when they come to Jesus Christ, they would find healing, deliverance, freedom, promotion and so on, and indeed, all these are true. Once they give their lives to Christ, they become fresh Christians. Fresh Christians are however, required to remain fresh at all times, just as we see in our Bible reading today. Yes, new converts are baby Christians who should grow into spiritual maturity, but they must never lose their freshness in Christ as they constantly renew their minds (Romans 12:2).<br><br>There are many distinct characteristics of fresh Christians. The very first thing is an insatiable hunger to know the word of God (1 Peter 2:2). People who just genuinely gave their lives to Christ don’t go late for fellowship. They even usually sit in front where there would be no distractions because they just have this strong desire for the word of God. Unfortunately, you see many people who have been born again for a long time forgetting this desire they once had. When you mature, you are supposed to advance to strong meat, but many fail to do this and rather become stale though they usually claim they have become mature. A Christian becomes stale when he or she stops feeding on the word of God daily.<br><br>Beloved, if you no longer spend quality time studying your Bible daily, you are becoming a stale Christian. Unless that hunger returns and you begin to feed on the word of God daily again, you are a dying Christian.<br><br>Another distinct characteristic of fresh Christians is that they cannot stop talking about Jesus. They are not ashamed of Christ at all. A Christian who has become stale however, will see himself or herself as too big to preach the gospel to everyone, forgetting Jesus’ command in Mark 16:15 and His warning in Matthew 10:33.<br>Freshness or staleness in Christ is not determined by how long you have been born again, but by your attitude towards the things of God.",

      "Fresh Christians are always joyful in the house of God. When you see a fresh Christian during praise and worship, the fellow will be singing and dancing with joy, unlike some so called big men of God who have now become so familiar with the Lord that they can’t dance for Him anymore.<br><br>Many years ago, while waving my tambourine and dancing for my Maker during the praise and worship session at a Pastors’ meeting, a big man of God tapped me me and said, “Look at you, a whole General Overseer, dancing like that”. I told him I would never stop dancing for the One who made me the General Overseer of RCCG. David, with all his majesty, never outgrew dancing for God. In fact, 2 Samuel 6:14 says he danced with all his might. What was the result? God kept lifting him steadily. He went from becoming king of Jerusalem to king of Israel and kept progressing until he became the father of the King of kings. Even the key of God that opens and none can shut is called the key of David.<br><br>Fresh Christians never outgrow praising God even after several years of surrendering their lives to Christ. However, people who see themselves as too big to dance for God because they think they are no longer new in the faith have allowed themselves to become stale Christians.<br><br>Fresh Christians submit to the authority God has placed over them. You will always hear them say, “My Pastor said…”, and the blessings of obedience always follow them (2 Chronicles 20:20). Many years ago, my Father-in-the-Lord told all the workers in the Church to empty their bank accounts and bring the money to Church. The next Sunday, when he was meeting with us again, he said the need had been met, then he asked, “How many of you actually obeyed the instruction? Only my wife and I raised our hands. As far as we were concerned, it was God saying it, so we obeyed. The other people who had been in the Church long before us however did not obey. In return, God raised us to become the leaders of the Church.<br><br>You must never become so familiar with men of God that you begin to disobey and disrespect them. That is not a sign of spiritual maturity, but rather, of spiritual staleness and death.",

      "After you have become born again for a while, the devil will try to test your faith. It is as you overcome these challenges and remain standing that you become mature in the things of God. At this stage, you would no longer be satisfied with the milk of God’s word; now, you would desire strong meat. A mature Christian wants to go deeper and not remain in the shallow waters of the word and ways of God.<br><br>Newly born again Christians, also referred to as ‘baby Christians’ must grow to the point where they can face trials and remain standing in Christ. Every Christian has low moments when the flesh seems to be rising above the spirit - periods when he or she could fall into sin if care is not taken. In such a period, someone who has been in Christ for a while but hasn’t been feeding on the word of God constantly is likely to fall. Proverbs 24:10 says: <i>“If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.”</i> The day of adversity will definitely come, but what will keep you standing is how much strength you gathered before that period.<br><br>How much of God’s word have you been consuming? How much praying have you been doing? How deeply rooted have you been in the things of God? These are the things that will go a long way in determining whether you will remain standing in the day of adversity. Know that the more mature you get, the bigger the adversity the devil is likely to bring your way, but we find solace in 1 Corinthians 10:13, which says: <i>“There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”</i><br><br>Thus, if a trial made you turn your back on God, it is not that trial really that brought you down, but rather your weakness in spiritual things. Jesus Christ said in our memory verse that if any man lays his hand on the plough and turns back, then he is not fit for the Kingdom of God. You have already laid your hands on the plough; build up your faith by engaging in spiritual activities like praying, Bible study, fellowship with other believers and so on. All these are required to enable you stand when the day of adversity comes.<br><br>Beloved, if you keep your Christian walk on a shallow level, you are likely to look back eventually and not make it to the Kingdom of God at the end of the day.",

      "When a child is born, everybody is at his or her beck and call. The child is not expected to do any chore in the house. However, as the child begins to mature, he or she may then be sent on one errand or another. It is the same way in the Christian walk. When someone has just become born again, the fellow is being fed by the mature Christians. When he or she comes to Church, the workers would direct him or her on where to park the car, where to sit and attend to whatever needs he or she may have. As the fellow continues in the Church and becomes a mature Christian, he or she would no longer be comfortable with just being served, but would rather now want to serve in the house of God too.<br><br>A Christian that is growing spiritually becomes increasingly responsible. Such a Christian will sacrifice his or her time, because he or she is now living for God. There are however, those who have been attending Church for years, yet they don't do anything else apart from attending Church services. How can you be coming to Church without being a responsible part of the running of the house of your Father? While others may be thinking of what God can do for them, a Christian that is growing spiritually will focus on what he or she can do for God.<br><br>Beyond working for God, a Christian that is growing spiritually is always willing to give to the things of the Kingdom. Just like Paul, he or she does not mind spending and being spent for the progress of the Kingdom of God. While others are arguing about whether to pay tithe or not, a Christian that is growing spiritually is willing to give 100% of his or her income to God. A Christian that is growing spiritually will not complain when the Pastor says there is a need to be met in the Church; in fact, he or she would want to be the first person to meet that need.<br><br>Many years ago, there was a rich man who regularly gave towards Church projects and still helped supervise those who, unable to give financially, contributed their labour. One day, we suddenly saw him removing his clothes and joining in the physical labour. Surprised, we asked why and he said God had just told him, “Big man, well done; the people doing the work will get the reward that you will not”. Cheerfully giving your money, time, and energy to serve God are some of the signs that you are growing  spiritually as a Christian. ",

In the same vein, as we mature in Christ, we are to start doing the works of Christ.

Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 5:12: <i>“For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.”</i><br><br>There comes a time in the life of a Christian when he or she ought to have started teaching others the gospel of Christ. Many believers don’t get to this level because they only read their Bibles rather than study it deeply. When you read, you read to be informed, but when you study, you study to be transformed. It is after you are transformed by the word that you begin to long to see that same transformation in others, and that longing pushes you to start teaching it. There are those who have memorised the longest chapter in the Bible, but they cannot teach the simple doctrines of faith because the word hasn’t transformed them. Don't just read the Bible, <i>study</i> it. When you experience the transforming power of the word, you will be eager to start teaching it too.<br><br>Another work that Jesus did which we are also expected to do, is the working of miracles. Miracles are not the exclusive reserve of Pastors only; they are for all Christians. Jesus said in Mark 16:17, <i>“These signs shall follow them that believe”.</i> As long as you are a child of God, when someone is sick around you, you are to lay hands on them so that they can recover. Many Christians don’t do this because while they have been in the faith for long, they have not been deliberate about their spiritual growth. Such people don’t spend quality time in God’s presence, praying, studying His word and seeking His anointing.<br><br>You must be deliberate about your spiritual growth because our Lord Jesus Christ  expects you to grow in Him and perform greater works than He did during His earthly ministry.",

In other words, if you make a vow and you fail to redeem it, do not be surprised if you call on God in the day of trouble and He does not answer you. Today, many Christians just make vows casually. Many a time, even when making the vow, they have no intention of paying it. If you don’t pay your vows, yet cry out in the day of trouble, God would not listen; it is clearly written in the memory verse of today. Don’t postpone the payment of your vow when you can do it now. God sees those who do that as fools.<br><br>A vow is like a deal. When you make a deal with someone and you don’t fulfil your part of it, it is like stealing from that person. It is foolish to try to steal from God because what you are keeping away was provided by Him in the first place. If you made a deal with God, fulfil your part speedily. Worse still, some people make vows because they want the Pastor to pray for them at that moment, without any intention to fulfil it. How can you lie to God to receive blessings from Him? Is that not the height of foolishness? <br><br>Once you make a vow to God and the devil sees that you want to pay that vow, he will start telling you to defer it to later, saying that you don’t have enough yet or that God understands. Don’t listen to his lies so that God doesn’t see you as a fool.<br><br>One interesting thing about fulfilling a vow made to God is that the One you made it to has the ability to give you far more than you have promised to give Him. If you fulfil your vow, He would pour His blessings on you, but if you refuse to, He would also withhold what He would have given you in return. Hannah made a vow to God that she would give Him her son if He would bless her with one. This was after many painful years of waiting, and she didn’t know if she would ever have another child again. Imagine her holding her child in her hands at last and then giving the child over to God. Going back home without her child must have been a great sacrifice. She did it because that was her vow, and God gave her five more children in return (1 Samuel 2:21). Job 22:27-29 says it is those who pay their vows that can decree a thing, and it is established. It is foolishness not to pay your vows.",

It would swoop in, pick your chicken, and no matter how much you curse it, it would not be bothered. However, when the eagle gets old and isn’t as fast as it used to be, little birds would begin to tease it. The eagle usually dies of hunger in old age. It is the end that matters.<br><br>After about four years, during which time the man had sold our land to other people and made a lot of money out of it, he developed a strange medical condition that made his stomach so huge that when he stood, his stomach could touch the ground.<br><br>Beware of what you do today because, God cannot be mocked; whatsoever you sow, you will reap (Galatians 6:7).

      "One of the major benefits of being a child of God is prosperity. Deuteronomy 8:18 says that God gives us the power to get wealth. In 3 John 2, He says clearly: <i>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”</i><br><br>One thing is clear from these Scriptures: God wants us to be prosperous. 2 Corinthians 8:9 even says that Jesus became poor so that we can be rich. The question now is: why does God want His children to prosper?<br><br>Firstly, no father would want his children to suffer. His children suffering would make him look like an irresponsible father. God wants you to prosper simply because you are His child. Psalm 128:1-2 backs this up: <i>“Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.”</i><br><br>After you have become prosperous however, God wants you to use that wealth to build His Kingdom. Zechariah 1:17 said: “Cry yet, saying, <i>Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.”</i><br><br>After God has prospered you, He expects you to use that prosperity to spread the gospel of His Kingdom.  He expects you to do things to advance His kingdom on earth and win more souls for Him. This means that if you are prosperous and not sponsoring Kingdom projects, then you need to have a change of mind. You need to be more concerned about using your money for God than for any other thing.<br><br>David wondered how he could be living in a palace, when his God is being worshipped in a tent (2 Samuel 7:2). This made him set out to build a temple for God. He was so determined to spend for God that even when God told him not to build the temple, he did not keep his money to himself; rather, he provided everything that Solomon needed to build it. If you have this kind of heart, you would see how God will promote and bless you, even more than you can imagine.",

      "Proverbs 23:21 says:<br><br><b>For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</b><br><br>If you are lazy, you would end up being clothed with rags. Some people don’t want to work hard; they just want to get rich overnight. It is not going to happen. Proverbs 19:15 says clearly: <i>“Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.”</i> The word of God is settled; if you are lazy, you will suffer hunger.<br><br>With all humility, I know many who came out into full-time ministry around the same time I did. Today when we meet after several years, they look at me and say, “Ah, God has been faithful to you”. I say, “No doubt about that, He has been faithful.” However, I always add very politely, “Nobody can accuse me of laziness”. If you say I am a lazy man, I will look at you closely and say, “You must be related to the devil”. Someone said, “You just finished the Holy Ghost Congress - a whole week of activities. And before the Congress, you spent weeks fasting and praying. In preparation, you even inspect everything, including the toilets. You then finish the congress, and a few days later, you say you are going a-fishing. Why not sit at home and tell your children to go and do the work?”. I said, “Thank you. As long as God gives me strength, I will be occupied for Him ''. The word of God is clear; if you are lazy, you can't expect His blessings.<br><br>You have to learn to be diligent. Proverbs 12:24 says: <i>“The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.”</i><br><br>Do you know what the above passage means? It means that if you are lazy, other people will rule over you in every sphere of life. If that is not what you want, then you must give no room to laziness in your life. Only those who are diligent will rise to the level of ruling others; those who refuse to be diligent are mean men who will be ruled and controlled by the diligent. Proverbs 22:29 says, <i>“Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men”.</i>",

      "Some people take the work of Christ as an excuse for being lazy. They think that because of God’s many promises, they can relax and not work. That is a big lie. Even Paul - the Apostle of grace, worked (1 Corinthians 4:12).<br><br>Anointed as he was, he laboured with his own hands. Students who refuse to study but say: “It is written; the Holy Spirit will remind us” should note that He would only remind them of what they have studied.  If you don’t study, what would He remind you of? The youths in our Churches and nations must stop looking for quick money and work diligently. You have the internet and many things that have made your work easier. Those who work hard never beg. They become strong, wealthy and very great. Don't spend all your time on social media or watching television. The people you are watching are working hard to make something of themselves.<br><br>Many years ago, I was in my uncle’s house on a visit from school. One day, there were masquerades outside the house, and everyone watched and cheered them while I was studying inside. He came to me and said, “Won’t you go and see the masquerades?” I responded with a Yoruba proverb translated, “The person who will be watched does not go around watching people”. My uncle reminded me of that day because now, I am being watched. If you want to be great, you cannot be spending countless hours watching videos on social media. Get out there and work. Some people only pray and fast and then complain when things don’t get better for them. Praying and fasting are not the keys to success; they can only enhance your efforts. If you put in no effort, then what will it enhance? One million multiplied by zero is equal to zero.<br><br>One of my sons says that you must pray like you will not work and work like you will not pray. As prayerful as I am, even at my age, I wake up before the sun is up every morning to work. I don’t say because I prayed for six hours last night, then I should sleep all morning today; that is not how I got to where I am now. Believe me honestly, if you are lazy, God will not use you. He needs diligent people; that is why Hebrews 11:6 says He only rewards those who diligently seek Him.",

The flesh always wants you to commit sin, while the Spirit wants you to please God. If the flesh wins the battle, then ultimately, the devil has won over your soul; that is why you must put your flesh under your control at all times, and one of the major ways to do that is to fast often.<br><br>Only a few select people have fasted for forty days and forty nights. The only three recorded for us in the Scriptures are Moses, Elijah and Jesus Christ. It will interest you to know that only the three of them were there on the mount of transfiguration, glowing like the sun. Today’s message is not for the faint-hearted; it is for those who really want to grow.<br><br>Don’t let anybody tell you that fasting ended when Jesus Christ said, “It is finished” on the cross; fasting is for now. In Matthew 9:14-15, some people came to Jesus Christ and complained about His disciples not fasting. He said that after His death, resurrection and ascension, the people would fast. Fasting is for now, and we will fast until the Bridegroom returns. When He returns, there will be no need for fasting anymore because 1 John 3:2 says that when He returns, we shall see and be like Him. When the rapture comes, those who are not dead will have their bodies transformed to become like the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. At that time, we won’t need food; whatever He eats in His new body is what we will be eating, but until then, while your body is still the way it is, warring against the Spirit, you must fast to remain in the light of Christ.<br><br>There are those who will tell you fasting is not for the age of grace. They are big liars. Paul - the Apostle of Grace, said in 2 Corinthians 11:27 that he fasted often. He fasted often so he could subdue the flesh, and it would not cause him to be cast aside (1 Corinthians 9:24-27). Apostle Paul said many people run a race, but only one will win.

      "When you start fasting, you will notice changes which show that your flesh no longer controls you. First, fasting will bridle your tongue. During a fast, it becomes clear to you that many a time, you don’t gain anything by talking. James 1:26 says if you say you are religious and you cannot control your mouth, you are deceiving yourself. Thus, as you fast and talk less, you also sin less.<br><br>Fasting also helps you to control your temper, particularly prolonged fasting, because you would have no energy to fight anyone. When you get angry easily, it is because you have a lot of energy; let me see how you will get angry when you have been fasting for twenty-one days and nights! If anybody offends you, you would simply say, “God bless you, just leave me alone”. Ecclesiastes 7:9 says clearly that you should control your anger because anger rests in the bosom of fools.<br><br>You should ask yourself how come your body hates fasting. Galatians 5:17 says the flesh lusts against the Spirit. In other words, your flesh wants to fight the Spirit. If we do not say there is fasting tomorrow, you can wake up and not eat until 2 p.m., but once we announce that there will be fasting, some people would eat until midnight and still wake up hungry. This is because the devil does not want you to fast; this should tell you that fasting is good for you. When you learn to fast, you will be amazed that there are certain agents of darkness in your life that you have been coping with, but they move easily when you fast. Matthew 17:14-21 tells us that there was a demon the disciples tried their best to cast out but could not, without fasting and prayer. There are certain mountains that won’t move unless you back your prayers with fasting.<br><br>In Exodus 17:8-13, when there was a war to be fought between Israel and the Amalekites, Moses went to the mountain top and lifted his hands, while Joshua was below the mountain, fighting. Whenever Moses’ hands were up, the children of Israel would be winning the battle, but when his hands came down, they would start losing. The spiritual controls the physical. The solution to that lingering problem could just be some days of fasting in addition to your prayers.",

Haman expected everybody to bow to him, but Mordecai wouldn’t bow to anybody except God. Haman decided to hang him and destroy his people completely by getting the king to sign their death warrant of all the Israelites.<br><br>When Mordecai heard of the decree from the king, he went to Esther, who was then the queen, for help. Esther replied in Esther 4:1-17 that they should all fast, and then she would go and see the king. They fasted for just three days and things began to change from that point. By the time we got to Esther 5:1-6, Esther appeared before the king without being summoned and the first result of the fasting was that instead of the king asking her to be killed, he spared her life. Fasting can change death to life.<br><br>The next thing that happened is that Esther found unusual favour before the king. The king told Esther that though he is yet to know what she wants, but she should consider it granted already, even up to half of his kingdom. When you fast, you get more than you ask for. By the time we get to Esther 6, the king couldn’t sleep until he honoured Mordecai. A good deed that Mordecai did many years previously, which had been forgotten, made the king restless until it was repaid. When you take fasting seriously, all your past benefits that you have been denied can be brought forward and handed over to you.<br><br>In Esther 7, the enemy of the entire nation became completely uprooted, and then in Esther 8, the house of Haman was given over to Esther. Proverbs 13:22 says that the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just; do you think the wicked will let go of their wealth easily? You get it by fasting and praying. Wealth changes hands when you fast. Mordecai also got promoted because promotion comes from God (Psalm 75:6-7), and since fasting draws you closer to God, it leads to promotion.<br><br>Finally, in Esther 8:3-17, the Jews were saved from destruction, and the Bible also says all the people around became Jews because they were afraid of the Jews.

The Bible says: <i>“And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”</i> (Matthew 3:17). This was repeated with greater emphasis according to the account of Luke on the Mount of Transfiguration where God, the Father, spoke to the inner caucus who were to spread the news later.  The account says:<br><br><b>While he hath spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.  And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</b><br>Luke 9:34-35 <br><br>Even after all these, the world still had not accepted Him as the Lord.<br><br>However, from John 8:46 when He boldly questioned, <i>“Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?”</i> up to His death in Matthew 27:54 when the soldiers said to themselves, “…Truly this was the Son of God”, the Lordship of Christ was being confirmed and established.  In our text for today, we read the account of the resurrection of our Lord:<br><br><b>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.  Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</b><br>Matthew 28:5-6<br><br>Apostle Paul wrote: <i>“But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain”</i> (1 Corinthians 15:13-14). May the Lord bless you as you exercise your faith in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. <br><br>The Bible says that anyone who believes in Jesus will not be condemned  however, those who do not believe in Him are condemned already because they did not believe in the name of the only begotten son of God – Jesus Christ (John 3:18).<br><br>Which group would you like to belong to?",

      "Yesterday we discussed how the resurrection of Jesus Christ confirmed His Lordship.  This, in essence, establishes that only the One with the power over death can be Lord indeed.  Today we shall look at another aspect of Jesus Christ’s Lordship - His dominion over all calamities and sicknesses, as seen in Isaiah 61:1. Luke 4:18 also corroborates this:<br><br><b>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.</b><br><br>When Jesus was confronted face to face with the madman of Gadara, for example, He demonstrated this virtue as the Great Deliverer and Miracle Worker when He cast out the demons that had held the madman captive for years (Luke 8:26-39).  Jesus came to preach the gospel to the poor for all-around salvation, and rebuked with authority all who tried to oppose Him. For example, He preached: <i>“Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves”</i> (Matthew 23:15). To this and many of His teachings, it was said: <i>“And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.” </i>(Matthew 7:28-29).<br><br>Our Lord Jesus Christ was asked to prove His Lordship in John 10:24-25. All He did was to simply refer His ‘interviewers’ to the work that His Father had been doing through Him.  He said: <i>“...the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.”</i> (John 10:25).<br><br>As children of God, we must be able to represent Jesus Christ adequately. All you need is to give your life to Jesus and live by His commandments. <br><br>I prophesy to you today: you will graduate from being a miracle consumer to a miracle worker, in Jesus’ name.",

      "Barrenness can also be described as fruitless efforts. It could take different forms, some of which could include physical, material, academic or ministerial barrenness. I pray that the Almighty God will put an end to every form of barrenness in your life today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Physical barrenness refers to when a married couple is childless. One of my daughters was told that there was no way she could carry a child because her womb was blocked. At one of our programmes, God spoke through me that there was someone whom the doctor had said couldn’t have a child, but that the fellow would have twins. She believed the prophecy and held on to God’s word. To the glory of God, she became pregnant and went abroad to deliver through a caesarean section. To the surprise of the surgeons, she didn’t even have a womb. This was about twenty years ago. Recently, I got a phone call from this daughter of mine, and she said she wanted to bring the twins to me for a visit. I was surprised when she arrived, because she was carrying a new set of twins. The first set were now in the University and God, in His mercy, gave her another set of twins. God did what only He can do.

      "Many times we pray and it seems like God cannot even hear our prayers, not to talk of answering them. We even see other people getting their prayers answered seemingly easily and wonder what our offence is that God has not answered us. In Genesis 30, the Bible says Rachel had no child for Jacob while Leah had birthed child after child for him, even as she aged. It must have really seemed as if God was not hearing Rachel’s prayers at all, but in verse 22, the Bible says: <i>“And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.”</i><br><br>One major prayer point that you must pray when it seems like God is not hearing your prayer is, ‘Remember me, oh Lord’. The first thing that happens when God remembers a person is that the fellow’s prayer would be answered. If you have been praying for one miracle or the other and there has been no answer, God will remember you this month, in Jesus’ name. Psalm 65:2 says: <i>“O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come”.</i><br><br>God hears prayers but the Bible says that if He is to answer, there are certain conditions that must be satisfied. For example, in Isaiah 55:6, the Bible says you must seek the Lord while He may be found and call on Him while He is near. Thus you may have been praying for a while, not even sure whether He is near or not because you cannot see Him, but when He chooses to remember, He Himself would draw near to you.<br><br>The second thing that happens whenever God remembers someone is that doors begin to open for the fellow. You may have been knocking on some doors that have stubbornly remained shut, but the One who remembered Rachel is He who has the key of David; when He opens, no man can shut and when He shuts, none can open (Revelation 3:7). If the enemy has shut a door against you, in the name that is above every other, this very day, it will be opened. All you need is for God to remember you. The Lord will remember you today as you pray, in Jesus’ name.",

You are sleeping spiritually when you are no longer excited to spend time with the One you call your Father. David prayed to God to restore unto him the joy of his salvation. This means he had lost the joy he used to feel as a child of God (Psalm 51:2). When material things become more important than the spiritual, when you believe natural laws more than the word of God, then you are sleeping spiritually. I believe God that you will awake from every spiritual slumber today, in Jesus’ name.<br><br><b>For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.</b><br>Isaiah 29:10 <br><br>When you see someone who keeps trying to cope with a problem instead of praying, it means he or she is already sleeping spiritually because the fellow cannot see what the devil is doing. If you make a decision when you are spiritually asleep, that decision is likely to be wrong because you would be spiritually blind. Before you decide on whom to marry or enter into a business venture with, make sure you are spiritually alert. When you sleep spiritually, you cannot discern spirits correctly. You would believe any false prophet who says things that appeal to you; you would embrace a wolf in sheep’s clothing and hand over your pearls to pigs.<br><br>A leader in the Church cannot afford to sleep spiritually because the devil can attack the people under his or her leadership and God says their blood would be on that leader’s head (Ezekiel 33:6-7). Therefore, if you are a leader in the house of God, more than anyone else, you must be spiritually alert.

      "The sleeping state of a man is a state when he is unaware of his surroundings and unable to change things around him. The enemies usually exploit this time to do evil. When a person sleeps spiritually, the devil would use that opportunity to steal from the fellow and destroy valuable things in his or her life.<br><br>During one of our conventions some years ago, there was a heavy rain and one of my children came to me and said, “Daddy what happened? You were supposed to be on the mountain praying”. I said, “I fell asleep; it was the rain that woke me up”. At first, when I awoke and saw the rain, I asked God, “Daddy, how could this be?” He replied, “I allowed it to rain because the crowd coming tonight will be much, so I need to cool the place down in readiness for them”. While I was asleep, the Devil was hoping the rain would discourage people from coming for the programme however, he did not know that God would make it favour us.<br><br>Believe it or not, as long as you are a Christian, the devil will fight you and if he finds you asleep spiritually, he will seek to devour you. If however, you are awake, you can resist him and he will flee from you. That is why we are warned in 1 Peter 5:8 to be vigilant. Stay awake so you can fight the enemy off. In Judges 16:19, it was while Samson was sleeping in the lap of a harlot that his supernatural strength was taken from him. It is important to note that when the devil wants to make a person sleep, he would provide things to please his or her flesh and this closes the person’s spiritual eyes. Sometimes, the devil uses money or career opportunities that take people away from their first love. That is why, no matter how good things get, you must always remain spiritually alert.<br><br>The reason I still go out on prayer walks at night, even at my age, is to avoid sleeping off. Sometimes, you need to get up and go somewhere uncomfortable so you can pray. Don’t allow the pleasures of this world drive you away from the presence of your Father in heaven.",

      "Death is likened to sleep in 1 Corinthians 15:51. In other words, a believer who is spiritually asleep is actually in a state of spiritual death. 1 Thessalonians 5:5-9 tells us clearly that we should stay awake spiritually, be watchful and sober. Matthew 24:42 says you must stay awake and be watchful, for you do not know what day your Lord is coming. Romans 13:11 encourages us that the Lord’s coming is nearer now than when we first believed.<br><br>Some believers keep going in and out of spiritual sleep. They feel it is normal to be cold and hot. I pity such people because their end is not usually good. A good example of this is Samson, who slept and woke up a number of times but the last sleep put him into the hands of his enemies. You may have slept a few times before and woken up again; however, you had better stop because there is always the last time a man would sleep and wake up to find himself being tortured by the enemy. If you used to love God with all your heart, but recently, other things have been competing with Him in your heart, then you are sleeping. God is saying to you like He said to the Ephesus Church in Revelations 2:4-5, “Return to your first love”. Ephesians 5:14 says if you awake, Christ will shine on you again.<br><br><b>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.Ephesians 5:14</b><br><br>Beloved, get back to your first love now. Put away those sins that easily beset you. Go for a retreat, look for fellowships with genuine believers, make a habit of spending quality time daily in prayers and Bible study. Jesus is ready to shine on you again if you are willing to wake up and get back to Him. He loves you and He is calling you back home. Don’t let the devil or anyone else hinder you from going back to the One who loves you enough to die for your sins. When He shines on you, everything the devil stole during your time of slumber shall be restored and you will become a better person at the end of the day.",

      "In our Bible reading for today, you will see that God told Elijah to anoint three people to replace him. This is because you can see pride in Elijah’s response when he says, “And I, even I only, am left…”. There is only one “I AM” and that is God Himself (Exodus 3:14). This is why, when Jesus Christ called Himself ‘I AM’ in John 8:58-59, the Jews were furious that He compared Himself to God. Of course, at that time, they did not know about John 1:1 and 14, which says Jesus is God who became flesh and dwelt amongst us. The name I AM must be reserved for God and God alone.<br><br>When you search the Scriptures, you would discover that the words ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’, ‘mine’ are the languages of pride. That was the language of Satan in Isaiah 14:12-15. When you find someone always saying ‘I’, ‘my’, you know you are most likely dealing with a proud fellow. Beware of this because the higher you go, the greater the risk of you saying ‘I’, ‘my’, ‘me’ all the time.<br><br>We see an example in the strong and anointed man of God called Samson. In Judges 15:14-16, where the power of God came upon him and he killed thousands of soldiers with a jaw bone, he said, “With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men”. There was no, “Thank You, Lord” to the One who sent down the power; it was all about himself. Even when God had clearly restored his strength in Judges 16:25-28, when the enemies had caught him and plucked out his eyes and he wanted to pray just one more prayer before dying, what did he say?<br><br><b>And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</b><br>Judges 16:28<br><br>It was about him all the way.

      "Another way by which a person exhibits pride is by comparing their achievements with those of others. Our Bible reading yesterday (1 Kings 19:13 – 18) showed us that God asked Elijah to anoint his replacements. There is a big lesson to be learnt there. You must never have a ‘holier than thou attitude’ or feel you are doing better than others. You may be more talented or hardworking; however, you must remain humble at all times. The point at which you become proud is where your rising stops. King Saul is another example of this (1 Samuel 15:25-30).<br><br>Our Bible reading today tells us clearly that our humility is required before God promotes us. In other words, once you become proud, you become too heavy for God to exalt. You cannot rise without the grace of God, so remain humble, no matter how much you think you have already achieved (James 4:6).<br><br>The word of God says clearly that those who compare themselves among themselves are not wise (2 Corinthians 10:12). There is only one true judge and that is God. The teacher is in the best position to see his or her students’ mistakes. For example, if we were to ask Joshua, “How well have you done?” he most likely would have said, “Extremely well” since he achieved what Moses could not. However, God said:<br><br><b>Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</b><br>Joshua 13:1<br><br>God was essentially saying that Joshua failed because he could not finish his job. Don’t ever think that you are perfect because, if we were to count iniquity, no one would be able to stand (Psalm 130:3). Just thank God for how far He has brought you and pray for others around you. Nobody is better than the other; we must prefer one another in honour (Romans 12:10).",

      "Every now and then, God commends His children; He tells them that He is pleased with them. When this happens to you, don’t become full of yourself because He is only being gracious. The Bible says that God is perfect and He expects perfection (Matthew 5:48). Ephesians 5:25-27 makes it clear that Jesus Christ is coming back for a bride without blemish or wrinkle. Are you perfect yet? If God says, “Well done, my son, you are doing great”, He is only being gracious. In Job 1:8, He said Job was a perfect and upright man, but then in Job 30:1, Job said things that a just man shouldn’t. When God scored him as just, He was only being gracious to him. In Numbers 12:3, it is written concerning Moses that he was the meekest man on the earth, but he was well known for his violent temper. God’s commendation is only an extension of grace. You must never let it get into your head; if you do, you would soon realise that you were nowhere in the first place. <br><br>The Bible says clearly in Romans 9:15-16:<br><br><b>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</b><br><br>It is not the works and effort you put in that will make you justified. It is true that you must put in the effort; if not, you may not even get a chance at being commended at all, but the effort does not justify you. It is only God’s mercy that justifies you. Never forget that. When God commends a person, the fellow’s efforts will yield greater results than his or her actions. When you start seeing this happening to you, you must remember that it is only because God decided to have mercy on you. Don’t begin to think that you are perfect, because you are not. Rather, thank Him for His mercy. Acknowledge your weakness before Him and even before people. Ascribe all glory to Him and not to your efforts because without Him, you can do nothing (John 15:5).",

Therefore, the word ‘I’ is applicable in your relationship with God; it is ‘I’, not ‘we’. David said in Psalm 34:1, <i>“I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth”.</i> Our relationship with God is personal. Salvation is an individual business.<br><br>Let me make it clear: God has no grandchildren. You are either a child of God or not. Our Bible reading for today says if your father is godly and you are ungodly, your father will live and you will die. God has no grandchildren, only children; so if you have not yet given your life to Jesus and you think that because your parents are born again, then you will go to heaven, you are deceiving yourself (Ezekiel 18:20).<br><br>Furthermore, after you become born again and get to heaven, the work you put into the Kingdom of God will also be tested individually by fire. In Romans 14:12, the Bible says: <i>“So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God”.</i> Every one shall give account of himself or herself to God. When it comes to God assessing you, it is going to be an individual business. In 1 Corinthians 3:13, the Bible says: <i>“Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is”.</i>  Our works will be tried separately, not together.<br><br>Remember that where we are going, there is no night there, so there is enough time. The Pastor, General Overseer and everyone else will stand alone with nowhere to hide. Therefore, when someone is discouraging you from doing the work of God now, remember that the fellow will not be there when your work is being tried. When you let someone else’s attitude affect your motives and zeal for God’s work, don’t forget that you will not be able to blame that fellow on the last day because you will be standing alone in front of God to answer for your actions and inactions.",

      "Parents usually love their children but oftentimes, they would have favourites even among them. They may try not to make it obvious, but they know who their favourite is. In the same way, there are favorites in the family of God. These are people who please God in every way they can. One of the major life ambitions of God’s favourites is to become very intimate with Him.<br><br>Whether you become a favorite of God or not is up to you; it is a matter of what you choose to love or hate. In 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, Paul said that in a race, there are many people running, but only one winner would emerge. The Lord wants you to be the winner. I don’t know about you, but I want to be at the forefront of this race. I used to be a runner when I was a little younger and our coach would always tell us to make sure we came first. To be number one, you must be willing to pay the price (Philippians 3:7-14). The prize you receive at the end of this race is determined by how willing you are to put your body under now.<br><br>When it comes to being intimate with God, it is more about what you do in private than in public. In Genesis 39:1-9, when Joseph was faced with tremendous pressure from his master’s wife to commit adultery, he ran away. He was very committed to honouring God, even in private. By the time you read Genesis 50:15-21, you see that his brothers came to bow before him. Those who want to be intimate with God don’t go after public approval and public image; they simply do what God loves, notwithstanding what the public thinks about it.<br><br>In Daniel 1:3-8, Daniel and his friends decided not to defile themselves with the king’s meat, contrary to public opinion. They must have looked crazy or like fanatics to some people, but they didn’t mind. As long as they were not defiling their bodies and God was happy with them, they were satisfied. In return, God made them the rulers of all the people when the time came. If you are not willing to count as loss those things that should have been gain so that you can win Christ, you are not willing to become intimate with God.",

      "To become intimate with God, the major thing you will need to sacrifice is time. The more time you spend with someone, the more you will become like that fellow. God loves it when we spend quality time with Him, so much so that He prefers that you spend more of your time with Him than you do for Him. The difference between spending your time for Him and with Him is in Luke 10:38-42. Martha was spending her time serving Jesus and that is good, but He said Mary had chosen what was needful by sitting at His feet to hear His word. The time you spend doing the work of God is good, but what is more needful is the time you spend at His feet, hearing His word.<br><br>There are many Church workers and pastors who only read and study their Bibles, pray or hear the word of God when they come to Church. You cannot become intimate with God that way. God wants people who love spending quality time with Him, whether in Church or alone, just because they love Him. As dutiful as David was, he just loved to spend time in the presence of God (Psalm 26:8). That is why God said in 1 Samuel 13:14 that David was a man after His heart.<br><br>To become intimate with God, you must never be satisfied with how close you are to Him now. You must constantly remain hungry for His word and His presence.  Those who will be intimate with God will never be satisfied with how much of Him they know Him; they will keep studying more, praying more, fasting more, all in a bid to know Him more. Apostle Paul said in Philippians 3:10, <i>“That I may know Him...”.</i> You begin to wonder, with all the revelations and encounters that Apostle Paul had gotten, he was still saying he wanted to know God. Believe me honestly, the day you feel as if you already know enough of God is the day you begin to draw further from Him. You will no longer know the things you thought you knew before. If you stop growing, you start dying. If you decide not to get closer to God, you will start getting closer to the devil. This is a race track you are on, not a highway with bus stops. Once you stop moving, you are taken off the race track.",

If you want to get close to God, you must know the things that He hates and stay far away from them (1 Thessalonians 5:22). Anywhere you see something that looks like sin, flee! Whenever I hear people trying to justify something sinful, I get irritated because clearly, this is something to stay away from. Apostle Paul said:<br><br><b>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</b>1 Corinthians 6:12<br><br>If you really want to be intimate with God, you will stay away from even things that, though lawful, would have a negative impact on your relationship with Him. In Daniel 1:3-8, Daniel decided not to eat the king’s meat. It was lawful but he knew that it would defile him, so he refused. It is lawful to be intimate with your legally married spouse or eat three times a day. There is no sin in that at all, but those who want to be intimate with God know that they must fast often. They know that there is a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing so that they can give themselves wholly to God (Ecclesiastes 3:5, 1 Corinthians 7:4-5). Apostle Paul - a man who desperately wanted to be intimate with God, refused to marry so that there would be absolutely nothing to distract him in his journey of intimacy with God.<br><br>The question to you now is: do you really want to be intimate with God? If you do, then there are some things you have to stay away from because they are impediments to the flow of the Spirit of God in a person’s life. You know them yourself; they make you feel filthy and draw you far from the Lord. Stay away from them. In turn, spend your time basking in the presence of God and just fellowshipping with true brethren. As you do this and get closer to God, you would begin to realise that you are becoming more and more like Him, and you will even begin to carry His power to work miracles.",

      "am a holiness preacher. In fact, if you were to cut me into a million pieces, each piece would keep crying, “Be holy”. The reason I keep emphasising the need to be holy is that I have seen the tremendous benefits in living a holy life. I will share some of these benefits with you today.<br><br>First, when you are holy, you become untouchable to the devil. In Job 1:10, the devil said God had put a hedge around Job, making it impossible for him to be harmed. There is a hedge of fire around every true child of God living holy. The devil cannot harm you even if he tries. The devil tried to kill Daniel by throwing him into a den of lions. He however, failed because innocence was found in Daniel 6:22. Throughout Jesus’ lifetime, the devil tried several times to get him killed but consistently failed because Jesus lived a holy life as we see in John 14:30 where Jesus said, <i>“Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.”</i> Jesus however, surrendered His life later so as to fulfill God’s plan (John 10:17-18).<br><br>When I was a Lecturer at the University of Lagos, one of my students came to me one day and told me she had a dream where four men pointed guns at her. When she awoke, she ran to a palm reader who told her she would die unfailingly on the 23rd of March, that year. She decided to go to a witch doctor and a so-called prophet who both said the same thing. When she told me the story, I told her, “If you give your life to Jesus, you will live and not die.” She gave her life to Jesus Christ, He washed away her sins and she left. On the 24th of March, she was still alive and I reminded her that I had told her she would not die. She however, told me that something strange happened the previous night. She said no one was able to sleep in her hostel that night as there were all sorts of strange occurrences. The spirit of death indeed came for her but couldn’t touch her because of the hedge of fire around her.<br><br>If there is sin in your life, the devil can harm you, but when you live a holy life in Jesus, he cannot touch you.",

      "We will progress in our study of the benefits of living holy today, as we look at how holiness can help you fulfill destiny. Nothing can stop you from fulfilling your destiny if you live a holy life. Let us consider Joseph. God revealed it to Joseph in Genesis 37:5-10 that he had a great destiny to fulfil. His brothers envied him, sold him into slavery and he found himself in the house of a rich man called Potiphar, whose wife wanted to sleep with him.  Joseph refused because he did not want to do anything to offend God (Genesis 39:9). He remained holy and at the end of the day, impossible as his dreams seemed, he fulfilled them.<br><br>One major thing that has kept me holy is the fact that I know it is only God who can help me fulfil my dreams. If you really want to fulfil your dreams, then you must live holy. If God Himself gave you a destiny to fulfil, then you can be sure He is on your side, willing to help you fulfil that destiny. Romans 8:31 says if God be for you, who can be against you? Even the devil dares not. The only fellow who can be against you is yourself. When you start sinning, God will turn away from you and then the devil will come in to ensure that you don’t fulfil that destiny. King Saul was destined to be a great king and God was on his side until he started to sin. God took His spirit from him and sent a tormenting spirit to him instead. In the end, he failed in his destiny. Do you want to fulfil your destiny? Live holy.<br><br>Hebrews 1:9 says:<br><br><b>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</b><br><br>If you want to be great, if you know that you need the anointing that will raise you above your fellows, if you want to receive a crown of righteousness at the end of your race here on earth (2 Timothy 4:8), then you must love righteousness and hate iniquity. There are many people I have come across with great destinies; they started well but somewhere along the line, began to commit sin and thus never fulfilled that great purpose for which God created them.<br><br>Beloved, if you love yourself at all, you would stop committing sins and start living holy.

Unfortunately, some people have believed the lie of the devil that no human being can be perfect. That is a lie because Jesus Christ will never ask you to do something He knows you cannot accomplish.<br><br>It is painful to say, but not every Bishop, General Overseer or evangelist is going to heaven, which is why your standard for perfection must be Christ, not man (Matthew 7:22-23). The things you do must be in line with the word of God only. If someone says something that is not in line with God’s word, no matter who they are, reject it. This follows that you must know God for yourself and not only through the lens of someone else. Apostle Paul said, “Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). In other words, Paul was saying that the moment you notice that I am not following Christ, stop following me. The only way to know if your spiritual leader is still following Christ is by knowing Christ yourself and you have your Bible to teach you all you need to know about Him.<br><br>The decision to be perfect is a personal matter. It is not something you do collectively; it is personal. You can be a part of a group of friends who fellowship with and hold one another accountable, but who knows what the others are doing in secret in the middle of the night? Who is there in your thoughts to check you when you are conceiving the wrong ideas? Joshua said, “As for me and my house”. The ‘me’ comes before ‘my house’. He didn’t say ‘As for us’. ‘As for me’, I will do the will of God, not ‘as for us’. It is written in Luke 17:34 that two people will be on a bed, one will be taken and the other left behind. In other words, a husband may go and the wife may remain, or the wife may go while the husband remains. It is a personal affair. Make your own decision today, let Christ be your standard and ignore what others are doing.",

Some people will probably jump at that and say, “What matters is the inside, not the outside.” That is untrue because whatever is on the inside will also show on the outside. When somebody is mad, he is mad on the inside, but the evidence is seen on the outside.<br><br>Many years ago, when we had just started the Redeemed Christian Bible College, I brought some Americans to teach the students, but they began to teach my people that I was too harsh and legalistic. They said God is only interested in what is inside the heart, not outside. When I heard this, I knew I was in trouble and sought the face of God for wisdom to handle the situation. Thankfully, He inspired me to buy two oranges of the same size and present to the students One was yellow and the other green. I asked them to choose one and they all chose the yellow one. I asked why and they said it would be sweeter than the green one. I asked them how they came to that conclusion as we had not cut it open; they said the outside shows what is inside. The message was passed.<br><br>The Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 that in the last days, there will be many people who will have a form of godliness. You may talk and dress like a Christian, but those things don’t make you one. Christianity is being like Jesus from the inside out. Your heart must yearn to be more and more like Him. You must avoid sin in order to please God. It is when your heart is aligned with Christ that every other thing on the outside begins to fall in place. You must study God’s word daily with the intention of getting to know more and more of Him. Spend quality time with Him in prayers and worship. Tell Him you want to have an intimate relationship with Him that will change you from the inside out and you would see Him reveal Himself to you like never before.<br><br>Your purity must start from within you, but it should also reflect on the outside.",

Many people parade themselves as children of God but dress and talk like people of the world (1 John 2:15). When you call yourself light but are looking, sounding and moving like darkness, we know that you are not who or what you claim to be (2 Corinthians 6:14).<br><br>2 Corinthians 5:17 says:<br><br><b>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</b><br><br>Right from the inside to the outside, all things become new when a person receives Christ -  not all things apart from the fashion sense or speech; ‘all things’ mean everything. When you change from the inside, it will show in every aspect of your life because the change is from the core of your being. When you see a Chinese man and a Yoruba man, you can clearly differentiate them by how they look, their language and the food they eat.  You don’t need to be told; you just know based on the fruits you see. When people see you, can they recognize the DNA of Christ in you? If they have to ask whether you are a child of God or not, then check well to see if you are a true Christian.<br><br>Some Pastors think that to convert youths to Christ, they must  dress and behave like them; not at all. The youths want someone disciplined enough to challenge them. They want to show youthful exuberance, with the expectation that their pastor would caution them. Unfortunately, the people they are looking up to for that discipline are the same ones coming down to their level. Check the way the seemingly unruly youths treat the disciplined ones: that will tell you that they value discipline. Why should you now want to be like the unruly ones? That must change.",

Some people even cut their jeans by themselves and call them crazy jeans. Do you now see clearly where their inspiration is from? Why have you made mad people your new role models? That in itself is worrisome.  As a parent, why would you allow your children wear things that portray them as people of the world, rather than of God? It is clear that some parents do not regard God highly; they would rather offend Him than discipline their children. I saw a girl dressed indecently one day; I asked her if her parents had been out when she left the house. She said they were at home and, in fact, it was her mother who had bought the dress for her. I said, “How can you walk through the streets like this? Don’t you know that your dress says that you are available and cheap?”. Surprisingly, she thanked me and said she had always suspected that her parents didn’t really care about her. Parents, teach your children to dress in a way that will glorify God.<br><br>Some husbands allow their wives to dress like harlots. I find this very hard to understand. You cannot enter a private property without an invitation because doing so would amount to trespassing. A wife is not for sale; she is already off the shelf, yet there are wives whose dressing proclaims them as cheap and available. Why would a woman dress in such a way that what belongs to her husband is exposed for the whole world to see? Some women will say they want to look ‘sexy’. Are you public property? The only fellow you should look ‘sexy’ for is your husband - no one else. The problem is that some husbands are so ignorant that they think their wife dressing half naked in public is stylish. May God deliver this generation from destructive mentalities, in Jesus’ name.",

      "To be double-minded is to be a hypocrite - one minute, you act a certain way and the next, you are someone else. You say something here and something contrary elsewhere. That is double-mindedness and a sign of an impure heart, according to James 4:8: <i>“Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.”</i><br><br>Matthew 5:8 says only the pure in heart will see God, so double-minded people will not make it to heaven. To be pure means to be of a single content. When people talk about pure cotton or pure wool, it means it does not contain any other kind of material. Purity, therefore, implies singleness of mind and purpose. One of the reasons I love dogs is that you can tell when they’re happy or angry. They have no pretense at all. Unfortunately, when it comes to human beings, they can smile at you and yet plan to kill you.<br><br>To be pure means no pretense (James 5:12). That is when your ‘yes’ is ‘yes’, and your ‘no’ means ‘no’. If you stand for something, stand for it all the way. In Luke 9:59-62, Jesus Christ gave us an illustration of this when He said the moment you have placed your hand on the plough, there must be no looking back. In Luke 16:13, He puts it another way: <i>“No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”</i> If you are serving one master today and serving another tomorrow, you are double-minded. Choose who your master is and stand by him or her all the way. If you want to serve God, then don’t serve money, or visit a witch doctor in secret; serve God and God alone. <br><br>As for me, I am serving the Lord Jesus Christ and I am going with only Him all the way. I tell you again brethren, whatever God does not do for you, no one else can do it. Many of us have not been getting full benefits from the Lord Jesus Christ simply because we are double-minded. James 1:6-8 says the double-minded should not even expect to get anything from God. Don’t be double-minded.",

      "Purity means ‘No contamination’. This also stems from the definition of purity we discussed yesterday. When something else comes into a material, it is no longer pure. All children of God must love Him with all their heart. Once any part of your heart is given to any other object apart from God, that object is a contaminant and must be removed immediately.<br><br>Every little contamination is dangerous. I gave an illustration many years ago in one of my books <i>As Pure As Light,</i> that if there is a big bucket of absolutely pure water that a group of people want to drink from, then a very little drop of feaces from a baby’s diaper drops into it - even if it is just a bit, would they still drink it? The big bucket of clean water becomes contaminated the moment faeces drops into it irrespective of the quantity. The water would no longer be pure and no one would want to drink from it.<br><br>In John 14:30, the devil came, examined Jesus Christ from top to bottom and discovered that He was pure; without any contamination whatsoever. That is the testimony I want to have also: that when the devil examines me, I will be able to say, “The devil found no contamination in me”. What about you?<br><br>In 1 Timothy 5:22, Paul was advising Timothy:<br><br><b>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.</b><br><br>Don’t get contaminated by other people’s sins; keep yourself pure. You can be contaminated by other people’s sin when you partake in it. For example, anyone who watches pornography is partaking in other people’s sins. When you and some people do something wrong and one of them tells a lie to cover the entire group and you say, “After all I am not the one that lied”, you are partaking in someone else’s sin and that has contaminated you. In Proverbs 1:10, we are advised: <i>“My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.”</i> If sinners entice you to come and be a partaker of their sins, run away. There is a congregation called the congregation of the dead (Proverbs 21:16). If you are found amongst them, you are like them already.",

If he has, you can hit him on that spot to get the upper hand in the match. When the devil wants to bring down a champion, he looks for the greatest weakness in the fellow and keeps aiming at it until he champion fails. This is why you must not allow any weakness in your life, because the devil will capitalize on it. You must destroy the weakness before it destroys you.<br><br>A hunter went hunting and killed a big leopard. He also saw a baby leopard and decided to take it back to the village because it looked harmless. The little leopard began to grow, playing with children in the village, and the hunter’s son was its best friend. Years later, the leopard had the hunter’s son riding on its back towards the village stream. The boy fell and bruised his leg on the ground. The leopard, wanting to help his friend, licked the blood on the boy’s leg.

      "I would like to give a clear illustration of what we discussed yesterday with the story of Moses. Numbers 12:3 describes Moses as the meekest man on earth, but he had the problem of anger. The devil discovered it in Exodus 2:11-12. Moses saw an Egyptian beating up an Israelite and because he couldn’t control his temper, Moses killed the man. Many years later, while leading the children of Israel to the Promised Land, the devil started hitting on this weak spot. In Exodus 14-15, we see the children of Israel complaining about different things; this was the devil throwing blows at Moses to get him angry but he dodged all of them. However, in Exodus 17:1-7, when there was no water to drink and they turned to Moses to complain again, he said in verse 2, “Why are you chiding with me?” The devil said, “Good, blow number 1 has landed, he is now beginning to respond”. In Exodus 32:15-20, Moses had gone to collect the 10 commandments from God; by the time he returned, the children of Israel were already worshipping an idol. When he came and saw them worshipping the idol, the temper in him rose and he took the two tablets of commandments that God gave him and smashed them.  At that point, the devil knew his punches were now landing.<br><br>In Numbers 11:10-15, when the children of Israel were complaining that they wanted meat, Moses turned to God and said, “God, why are you doing this to me? Am I the father of these people?” The devil said, “Good, now I have turned you against your supporter”. By the time we get to Numbers 20:2-13, the people murmured again about water, but this time, instead of speaking to the rock as God commanded, Moses was so angry that he hit it twice. God asked him to speak to the rock, but He decided to strike it. That was disobedience. At that point, the Almighty God said, “Moses, you will not reach the Promised Land”.<br><br>The meek Moses - with only one little contamination called anger, had become, after forty years of ministry, a failure.<br><br>Beloved, kill that little weakness in your life before it kills you.",

      "When gold is found, it is in its raw state. It is undesirable and filled with impurities. Raw gold must first be purified with fire before it reaches its full potential and becomes useful. Our Bible reading for today says that after God has taken you out from the heathen, He will pass you through the process of purification. When you met Christ, you were in your raw state. God cannot leave you in that contaminated state because you can only be useful to Him after you’ve been purified. To purify you, He will need to introduce fire. There are two types of fire God usually uses to purify. The first one is the fire of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Peter was one of the first people called by the Lord Jesus Christ in Mark 3:13-19, but he had one little problem: he was always afraid, and the devil discovered this weakness. That is why, on the day Jesus was arrested, the devil brought three people to test Peter, knowing that he would be too afraid to identify openly with Jesus. Indeed, Peter denied Jesus three times. The devil was happy that he had gotten Peter but thankfully, Jesus had prayed for him so he repented and found his way back to God. Now, if Peter was going to be useful to God, Jesus needed to do something about the fear contaminating his heart, so He purified him by fire. On the day of Pentecost, when the fire fell on all the disciples, Jesus was purifying them to make them useful. Immediately that fire sat on the head of Peter; it consumed the fear in him (Acts 2:1-47). The man who used to be afraid suddenly became very bold. The contamination was removed by the fire of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The Holy Ghost Baptism is a refining fire that takes away impurities in the life of a believer. If you are truly baptised - that is, after sanctification (setting oneself apart for God), then that fire will burn off all impurities in you. Note that a person may speak in tongues, but if he is not yet fully surrendered to Christ, if his heart is still after the things of this world, he cannot be purified. Sanctification must happen first before the fellow can truly be purified by the fire of the Holy Ghost.",

      "Following yesterday’s study, the second kind of fire God uses to purify His children is the fire of affliction. Let us take Job, for example. When you look at Job 30:1, you will be shocked to discover that Job had that little contamination called Pride. After he lost everything, he discovered that God has a way of making a fellow humble by fire. God used the fire of affliction to remove pride from his life.<br><br>Some people have asked me why I am always saying ‘Yes, Sir’ and ‘Yes, Ma’am’ to everybody. I wasn’t like that before. I was one of the proudest persons you could ever meet - even though I was poor, but God taught me a lesson that settled the issue of pride in my life forever. When I got born again, one of the greatest blessings I received from God early on was the ability to hear Him. I was also the interpreter for the General Superintendent of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. One day, for whatever reason, one of the Pastors came to me and asked me to interpret for him during his ministration. I felt offended. “Who does this man think he is? Doesn’t he know that I am the General Superintendent’s interpreter?” I interpreted quite all right, but I was very upset. After the Service, as I was going to my car, I heard God say clearly, “So you are now too big to interpret for my servant”. I stopped hearing from Him and everything became silent. As soon as the devil discovered that I was no longer hearing from God, he tormented me. I prayed, wept and fasted, but God was silent all through. Believe me, honestly, it is better not to have heard from God at all than for Him to stop speaking to you. God will not leave you alone, in Jesus’ name. <br><br>The period God stopped talking was a terrible time for me. In desperation, I told Him, “Lord, I make a covenant with You: if I am going to offend you tomorrow, take me away today”. And then He started to speak to me again. Thus, when you see me saying “Yes, Sir” to the driver or the cleaner, it is because fire burnt pride out of me. <br><br>If God is to use you, one way or another, He will have to purify you because only those pure in heart will see Him on the last day.",

      "There are different types of promotions. When a human being promotes you, don’t rejoice too much because it is temporary. However, when God promotes you, you are really promoted. Even though you become the president of a country like America, you can only hold the position for a maximum of eight years. When man promotes, it is temporary; only God gives real promotion that no one can interfere with.<br><br>Since we know now that the only way to really make progress in life is to be promoted by God, then we need to find out His criteria for promotion. God promoted David from being a shepherd boy to becoming the king of Israel for one simple reason – David was sold out to the will of God (Acts 13:22). David was not a man to argue with God. With David, God’s wish was his command. The reason God gave Jesus a name that is above every other is what He said in John 4:34: <i>“…My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work”.</i><br><br>In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus wished the cup of suffering for the sins of the world could be taken away from Him, but He said to God,<i>“Not my will but yours be done”</i> (Luke 22:42). When Jesus was teaching His disciples to pray, one of the prayer points He mentioned was:<i> “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”</i> (Matthew 6:10).<br><br>God wants His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Therefore, when He sees someone willing to do His will, He promotes that fellow to a position of authority. If God promotes somebody because the fellow started in humility and submission to Him, but along the line begins to disregard His instructions, that fellow would be demoted immediately. That is what happened to Saul in 1 Samuel 15:24-28. Saul started out well, but somewhere in-between, he preferred to please the people over doing God’s will. Some people have been asking God to promote them, but they have no regard for His will. Promotion will only come when you surrender completely to God’s will.",

      "When Jesus died and rose again, God gave Him great influence such that at the mention of His name, every knee bows and every tongue confesses that He is Lord (Philippians 2:10-11). When you read Philippians 2:5-8 and see how Jesus Christ humbled Himself, even to the point of dying on the cross, one thing you will see clearly there is meekness - that is, being so powerful yet acting so weak for the good of others and the fulfilment of God’s will. This is what led to God exalting Him so highly and giving Him such great influence. Matthew 5:5 says: <i>“Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth”.</i> It is the meek that will inherit the earth; they are the ones who will reign and have influence on the earth.<br><br>When you look at the story of Elisha closely, you will see that he was a successful farmer who willingly became the servant of a Prophet (1 Kings 19:19-21). Because he was willing to go so low for the fulfilment of God’s agenda, God gave him so much influence that even the king of the land called him “Father” (2 Kings 13:14).<br><br>I told my children a few years ago when they asked me to talk on The Pains and Gains of Change, that one of the gains is influence. When I joined the Redeemed Christian Church of God, God told me to submit to the General Superintendent who wasn’t even educated, and I did it with all joy. When my Father-in-the-Lord later died and I was to go into full time ministry, it wasn’t a joking matter. I had known the worst kind of poverty and then worked my way through to getting a doctorate degree. I may not have been wealthy, but at least I had enough money to take care of my family and pay my bills. Now God was calling me into full time ministry to head a Church with little to no income. I went through the pain and today, at least if only in Nigeria alone, I can introduce you to many people of influence; above all, I can introduce you to the King of kings.<br><br>Influence comes with meekness.

      "The power of God does not come cheap. I remember asking God to give me power to work miracles and He answered, “Start where Jesus started”. I was excited, thinking I would repeat Jesus’ first miracle, until the Lord pointed Matthew 4:2 out to me – where Jesus started with forty days of fasting and prayers. If you want power from God Almighty, you must be ready to conquer your flesh. When you are ruled by the Spirit, not the flesh, then God can trust you with power. If you can get addicted to fasting, prayer, studying the Bible and holiness, then you are a candidate that God can consider for the possession of divine power. When I talk about holiness and living above sin as one of my major secrets of power, some people think I am only being legalistic, but when you read Hebrews 1:9, you will see that you must love righteousness and hate iniquity for God to anoint you.<br><br>Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:27 that he put his body under subjection. He said also that he fasted often (2 Corinthians 11:27). What was the result of all these? Acts 19:11-12 says that when demons saw his handkerchiefs, they ran; that is power. When I am fasting and emphasising holiness everyday, I know what I am doing. I am seeing the results in my life so I will not stop. Several years ago, the Full Gospel Businessmen’s Fellowship International invited me to preach on ‘The New Anointing’. By the time I had finished speaking, I had to sneak away into the car because everybody wanted to touch me. There was a man running after me with a handkerchief in his hand. Fortunately, he was able to reach the car and he rubbed his handkerchief on it before I drove off. Back at home, there was a little girl who was so demon-possessed that it took six men to hold her down. He arrived on the scene, touched the girl with the handkerchief and she became normal again. <br><br>If you want this type of power, you must be willing to pay the price. You must learn to put your flesh under subjection, and God will give you power to do great things for Him.",

      "Anointing, just like electricity, obeys certain natural laws and can be transferred by way of  conduction.<br><br>Transfer of anointing by conduction is when the anointed fellow has physical contact with the person who needs the anointing. This can be through a handshake or laying on of hands. For example, in Acts 3:1-8, the lame man at the Beautiful Gate didn’t walk until Peter grabbed him. The anointing flowed through Peter’s hands into the lame man. Jesus Christ said in Mark 16:18: <i>“They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover”.</i> Jesus was saying that when we lay hands on the sick, the anointing in us will be transferred to them and the sickness will be gone. Sometimes, it may even be unintentional. For instance, the moment you step on a naked wire, knowingly or unknowingly, the electricity running through it will run through you too. Similarly sometimes, anointing can be transferred by conduction without both parties even trying to initiate the transfer. For example, in 2 Kings 13:20-21, when the dead man’s body accidentally fell into the grave of Elisha, the fellow came back to life.<br><br>A few years ago, I was abroad and decided to go shopping in a bookshop. A man came into the bookshop and made a joke about the large number of books I was buying. He stretched his hand to shake me and I shook his hand without trying to transfer anointing to him. Suddenly he shouted, “Who are you?” because the back pain he had been suffering from for many years suddenly disappeared as I shook his hand. That is transfer of anointing by conduction. Beloved, whenever you have the opportunity to shake hands with an anointed fellow or have them lay hands on you, don’t take it for granted. Your life can change just by that simple contact. This is not to say you should go around trying to touch every man or woman of God you see by force; be respectful and decent about it because the same anointing that heals can kill also, if grieved.",

      "Another way by which the anointing can be transferred from an anointed person to someone who needs it is by convection. Just think of how car batteries are charged. Dead batteries absorb enough power to supply electricity to your car. In the same way, an anointed man or woman can pray on a handkerchief or oil, send it to the place where the anointing is needed, and miracles would begin to happen through that medium. This is because it has become charged with anointing. In our Bible reading today, we see a very good example of transfer of the anointing by convection. Handkerchiefs or aprons that had contacted anointing from the body of Paul were used to heal many sick people and to drive out evil spirits.<br><br>I remember the first time I transferred anointing by convection. I had just returned from a journey overseas and was tired. One of my daughters came to me asking that I come and pray for her grandmother, who had just been operated on, but because of old age, the wound refused to heal. I was too tired to go with her to the hospital, so I prayed on a handkerchief and gave it to her to lay it on her grandmother. She did as I said and by the following day, not only was the grandmother healed, the doctors could not even find the scar from the surgery. The handkerchief transferred the power of healing. You must note, however that this is a higher form of transfer of anointing than conduction.<br><br>If you have just been newly anointed, you may need to spend quality time praying on the medium through which you want to transfer the anointing.  As you grow in the anointing, you would get to the point where you can just pray a simple prayer on the medium and it would become anointed. You can reach the point where the medium becomes charged just by touching it. In Acts 19:11-12, the Bible did not say that Apostle Paul prayed on the handkerchiefs and aprons; he only touched them while using them and they became charged, but that was when he had gotten to the point where God was doing special miracles by his hands.",

      "Over the past two days we have discussed condition and covection as methods of transferring anointing. Toda, we will discuss a third method called 'radiation'. Radiation in this context refers to when the anointing is transferred through the air without any form of physical contact. This is the highest form of transferring of anointing.<br><br>We see the transfer of anointing by radiation in Acts 5:12-16 where Peter did not touch the sick at all; they were only laid on the floor and his shadow healed them. Anointing can be transferred from the preacher on the altar to someone sitting in the congregation or even through a television set, radio, phone and so on.<br><br>With the millions of people who attend our programmes in the Redemptiom Camp, it is impractical to lay hands on everyone, so God increased His anointing upon me and made it possible for me to just wave my hands from the altar and even people at the back of the auditorium would be healed. As the crowd grew even more, God increased the anointing so that it could be transferred through a combination of both radiation and conduction. Now when I wave my hands and pray on people’s handkerchiefs, those handkerchiefs become anointed and the Lord works miracles through them.<br><br>There was a fellow who came to one of our programmes during which, as led by  the Lord, I said “Whatever garment you are wearing today is anointed”. The following week, the man was going to work in his car and there was a crowd blocking his way, so he parked to find out what happened. He saw that a vehicle had knocked someone down and the fellow was dead. He suddenly remembered that the jacket he was wearing was the one he wore on the Holy Ghost night, so he pushed the people aside, took his jacket, laid it on the dead man and the fellow got up. Anointing was transferred to the cloth by radiation, then the cloth transferred the anointing to the dead fellow by conduction.",

To become the king of your industry, you must be the most hardworking person in that industry; you must be so good that you become a force to be reckoned with in your industry.

Martha thought she was doing the right thing and told Jesus to instruct her sister to join her, but He told her that Mary had done the one needful thing, which is to spend time at His feet. He said further, “Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.” Someone can take a position in Church away from you or even deprive you of the opportunity to serve God in a particular area, but no one can take your intimacy with God away from you.

You miss a lot when you don’t take notes. My professor of Mathematics who got his PhD in the year 1928, told us that you have to read something ten times to remember it all. If you did not take notes, how will you read it over again in order to remember?<br><br>Some messages are not very easy to swallow at the time you are hearing them, but one day, the Holy Spirit may take you back to that note and then open it up to you on a deeper level. It is a matter of even more concern when ministers of the gospel who expect the congregation to be taking notes when they are preaching don’t take notes when other ministers are preaching. If you don’t have an actual notebook with you, at least you can use a note taking app on your smart phone or tablet. When a sermon is going on, the Holy Spirit is likely to whisper some things into your ears; they could be prophecies or instructions. You need to write those things down so that you don’t forget. Also, as the preacher is speaking, to help you practice what is being preached, you may need to write down one or two actions you will take in line with the sermon. You need to also write down aspects of the sermon or passages of the Bible that you would like to conduct deeper study on.<br><br>You must understand that these notes are treasures from which you and others coming after you can gain from. At the Open Heavens International Centre, there are some of my old sermon notes from over 30 years ago; they are treasures for many who visit the gallery to draw lessons from.<br><br>In Revelation 1:19, God told John to write the things he was seeing down as a treasure for us today to know what is to come in the end time. We also saw similar instances from our memory verse and Bible reading today. Beloved, you should take notes whenever you are listening to or studying the Word of God.",

      "Whether you realise it or not, people are watching you and tagging you with an identity. The tag they give you is dependent on their observation about what you do regularly. <br><br>If the people around you are to be honest with you, there is something in particular that they know you for and you need to know what it is because that thing is likely a reflection of who you are. You may not like what they call you, but if everyone agrees that a tag or identity fits you, rather than fight them for tagging you that way, you can just take it as feedback and change your character.<br><br>It could be offensive when you can remember your positive attributes but people seem to only pick out your negative attribute and tag you with it. Don’t be offended; God is only using them to sharpen you and make you a better person. Rather than complain, saying, “Can’t you see all my positive behaviours?” take the feedback and use it to improve yourself. Don’t mind the fact that they are not commenting on the things you thought were good about yourself; you just take whatever negative thing they say and turn it to positive so that you can be better person.<br><br>Now, since people will most likely notice the negative traits of a person before the positives, if you want to be known for the latter, you have to do it so much that it will be impossible for them not to notice it. Improve on your strengths. I have always wanted to be known as the man constantly winning souls for God, so I do that at every opportunity and today, people know that if you give Pastor Adeboye the microphone just to greet the people, he is likely to tell them to give their lives to Christ. I love to praise God and I want people to know me for that, so I am not ashamed to carry my tambourine around with me everywhere.<br><br>Begin to repeatedly exhibit those good behaviours that you desire people to identify you with.

      "In our memory verse for today, the words “Let not your heart be troubled” simply mean “Don’t worry”. Whenever the Bible says “Don’t worry” it means there is something that could cause a person some anxiety. Whenever you hear God say “Fear not” it means there is something frightening around. The Bible says in Matthew 6:31 that you should not worry because that is what the heathens do. If you really have faith in God, if you really believe He loves you, then you should not worry about anything. The God that feeds the birds in the air is capable of feeding you too. The God that clothes the lilies in the field so beautifully will clothe you too. If you are sure that He is your Father indeed, then you have no reason to worry. The son of a billionaire is never worried about what to eat or what to wear. Your Father is not just a billionaire- all the gold and silver in the world is His (Haggai 2:8). He promised in John 14:14 that if you ask for anything in His name, He will give it to you; anything means ANYTHING.<br><br>While He has promised to give us whatever we ask of Him, we must however, not be lazy. I have discovered that many Christians are lazy. There are jobs I have given to Christians to do and they charge much higher than the normal fee, yet didn’t deliver on time and did the work shabbily, A similar job given to an unbeliever would not only cost less but would be thoroughly done and delivered within the agreed timeframe. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says God does not support laziness and anyone who is lazy should not eat. Anyone who calls himself or herself a Christian and is lazy is not a child of God, and so the Lord is not under any obligation to provide for him or her.<br><br>There are many people who sit around all day saying they haven’t found a job, that is why they are not working. What a lazy attitude! Get up and find something productive to do with your time. Look within you; there must be one skill you have that you can use to meet other people's needs. if you remain focus and continue to improve yourself, you will definitely begin to some income from it sooner or later. Years ago, there was a man who didn't find a job so he started frying akara (bean cakes) by the road and within months, had bought two motorcylcles and was earning income from them. God has promised to bless the work of your hands (Deuteronomy 28:12), but you must first show Him the work.",

      "There are some people who go beyond worrying about the basic things of life, to fearing the unknown. They worry about if all  they have disappears because Proverbs 23:5 says riches can develop wings and fly away.  The Almighty God says “Don’t worry at all” because He is the All-Sufficient God (Genesis 17:1). The One who gave you what you have now has much more in store for you. Philippians 4:19 says you should not worry because He will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory. Do you know how rich He is in glory? Isaiah 6:3 says the whole earth is full of His glory. He is extremely rich in glory and since He has promised to supply your needs according to His riches in glory, then you know that supply will never run dry. Proverbs 10:22 says: <i>“The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.”</i><br><br>If your riches are from God, then you have absolutely nothing to worry about; otherwise, understand that money gotten in sin comes with plenty of sorrows.<br><br>You can be very rich and have many servants, but if they know you are very old, you can call them and they won’t answer. In fact, the Bible calls old age evil days (Ecclesiastes 12:1-3). Some people, even though they are surrounded by friends, grandchildren, servants and everything they need, still worry. They worry about what is going to happen when they die. They worry about where they will spend eternity. In Psalm 37:25, David said, <i>“I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.”</i>. The same David told us in Psalm 34:10, <i>“The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.”</i> He concluded Psalm 23 by saying that there is only one thing for you to look forward to if you are on the side of the Lord and that is goodness and mercy all the days of your life (verses 5 and 6). As long as you are on the side of the Lord, put your mind at rest, God is working overtime taking care of you.",

      "Isaiah 6:1-3 tells us that the Almighty God, even though He is all-powerful, loving and glorious, wants to be known for one thing above all others and that is that He is holy. He is a holy God and that makes it impossible for Him to lie. Numbers 23:19 says God is not a man that He should lie, neither the son of man that He should repent. Psalm 119:89 says His word is forever settled - in other words, you can rely on His word. Psalm 33:8-9 says once He speaks, it is done.<br><br>Why must we believe in Jesus Christ? John 14:6 says He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. If you believe in God the Father and God the Son, it automatically follows that you will believe in God the Holy Spirit. This is because John 15:26 says the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father. 2 Peter 1:20-21 says the Bible is written by the hands of men who were inspired by the Holy Spirit. In other words, your Bible was written by the Holy Spirit, using the hands of men. Since 1 John 4:6 says the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, then it follows that everything you find in Scripture is the truth.<br><br>Unless you believe the entire Scripture, you are not even saved. John 1:11-12 says:<b><br><br>He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</b><br><br>If you are truly saved and you believe the entire Scripture, then you can go ahead and claim your healing because it is written in 1 Peter 2:24 that by His stripes we were healed – past tense. All that God is waiting for you to manifest divine health is simply your willingness to obey every word of His. You can also claim your deliverance if only you would believe. John 8:32and 36 says you shall know the truth, the truth shall make you free and whosoever the Son sets free shall be free indeed. There are lots of blessings available to the believer. All you have to do is believe in God, believe in His word, and everything He has promised in the Bible will be yours.",

Malachi 3:10 for example that talks about tithing is ignored by such people. They ignore Proverbs 3:9-10 too. Then I ask them, what about Isaiah 54:17 which says no weapon fashioned against you shall prosper? What about <i>“The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want”</i> in Psalm 23:1?

There is instant salvation, the kind that happens when people answer the altar call (Romans 10:13) and then there is the ultimate salvation, which happens when you endure to the end as seen in Matthew 10:22 <br><br><b>And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</b><br><br>The fact that you are standing now is great, but you must stand until the end to be saved.

When you are famous, you cannot even take a stroll outside or play in a public place like every other person.<br><br>One of the dangers of being famous is that people tend to forget that famous people are human beings too.

When He was going to Jairus’ house, He had all the twelve disciples with Him, but it was only those three who He took with Him (Mark 5:35-42). Peter, James and John saw His power; they saw Him raise the little girl from death while the others only heard about it.<br><br>Why did the Lord have a special inner circle amongst His disciples and why did He love one of them specially? Well, the simple answer is that God has favourites.<br><br>Many people say that God has no favorites. This is not true. The question you should be asking therefore is “How do I become one of His favourites?” When you read Romans 9:11-16, the Bible says a woman was pregnant with a set of twins. Before they were born, God said the elder would serve the younger, that He loved one and hated the other even, when they were not yet born.

He said it is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of the Lord who hat showeth mercy.<br><br>In Acts 10:34-35, the Bible says:<br><br><b>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</b><br><br>This passage makes me see clearly that God looks out for certain things in people before He makes them His favourites.

      "In my study of what it takes to become a favourite of God, I saw in Luke 5:1-11, where the Bible tells us that after Jesus paid Peter a visit and performed that miracle of a boat-sinking catch, Peter left all and followed Him. He didn’t sell the fish he caught that day. However, all the other disciples also left everything they had and followed Him (Matthew 19:27), so there must be something extra about Peter, and I saw a little bit of it in Mark 14:54 when Jesus was to be arrested  and the disciples, fled. The Bible says Peter followed after the Lord. I know that people always like to underline the fact that he followed afar off, but at least he followed. Where were the others?<br><br>Peter always followed Jesus because there was a rope permanently tied to Him and the Lord –the rope of love. The love Peter had for Jesus was like a magnet drawing him closer to the Lord daily.<br><br>As soon as Peter recognised the Lord after His resurrection, he jumped into the sea to go and meet Jesus. He abandoned the great catch of fish that he had just gotten - again. Clearly, this shows that Peter was very much interested in the Lord, not what the Lord could give. He was interested in the Lord Himself. Those who become God’s favourites are people who are not after what God can give them but after God Himself. They just love God with all their hearts - whether He gives them anything or not. It is this selfless love that made God choose Peter as His spokesman.<br><br>In Acts 2:14-40, on the day of Pentecost, who preached? Peter. In Acts 3:1-8 at the Beautiful Gate, who spoke to the lame man? Peter. When God wanted to uproot Ananias and Sapphira - the first pretenders in the Church, it was Peter who pronounced their death.  The Lord will not make you His favourite when He sees that your belly is actually your god and not Him (Philippians 3:19). Some people want to be able to command the devil, but he mocks them because he knows that they love the things of the world, so they are under his control, not the other way around.",

      "Further into my study of how to become God’s favourite, I found that there was another disciple who also followed Jesus on the day He was crucified. It was this disciple that helped Peter access the courtyard as we see in John 18:15-16. This other disciple apparently was John the beloved as he referred to himself in the third person all through his account of the gospel. When you read John 19:26-27, you will find that it was John who took the mother of Jesus into his own house. Anyone who look after your mother must be very close to you. <br><br>I’ve always said that when you describe somebody as a Christian fanatic, it simply means he loves the Lord more than you. In John 20:1-8, the Bible tells us that when they brought news to the Apostles that Jesus was risen, John was the first Apostle to get to the tomb. In John 13:21-26 when the disciples sought to know who would betray the Lord,  Peter beckoned to John and told him to ask Jesus, because he knew that John. Even Peter knew that John was the closest to him. Thirteen people were at the table and two of them were speaking in codes the others could not understand. John was so close to Jesus that he could rest his head on His chest(John 13:23). <br><br>In our Bible reading for today, we see that it is only John that Jesus trusted with the identity of who would betray Him. Jesus trusted John with His secrets. When God can trust you with His secrets, you become extremely close to Him. Jesus made John His confidant, that is why you find that in Revelation 1:1-20, it was John the Beloved whom Jesus chose to give the story of what will happen in the end times, Thousands of years ahead of his time. In Revelation 10:4, there are things Jesus revealed to John that He said were for his ears only.<br><br>When you truly love God, you become willing to seek and fulfill his primary heart desire which is to bring souls into His Kingdom.",

The place He is preparing in Heaven is only for those living Holy and are without blemish, spot or wrinkle.He is coming back only for this people as they will be presented to himself as His bride. Ephesians 5:27. <br><br>It is interesting to know however, that Jesus may be preparing a mansion with the name of someone on it, but that fellow may eventually not stay in that mansion while someone else takes his or her place. That is why Revelation 3:11 says <i>“Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.”</i> <br><br>In the days when it was considered a crime in a certain country to believe in Jesus Christ, some soldiers five young Christians. In the peak of terribly cold weather, the soldiers stripped these five boys and sent them into a freezing lake. The soldiers built a fire to keep themselves warm and said to these boys, “All you need to do to come to this warm fire and have your clothes on is to deny Jesus Christ”. After a little while, the boys began to freeze in the water. When they were about to freeze to death, one of the boys raised his hand and told the soldiers he was no longer a Christian. They told him to come to the fire. As he started moving towards the fire, God opened the eyes of one of the soldiers and he saw five angels, each one carrying a crown, just waiting for these boys to breathe their last so they could crown them and welcome them home. As the boy who denied Jesus began to walk out of the lake, his angel turned to go away with his crown. The soldier cried “Angel, wait for me, I will take the crown”. He removed his clothes, jumped into the lake, died with the other four and took the crown of that young man.<br><br>Starting a race is of little consequence; what really matters is if you reach the finish line.",

      "When I became a Christian, I was determined not to be an ordinary one. I wanted to be a Christian with power to do the impossible. I soon discovered that to get power from God, you need to be totally sold out to Him. When you study Paul the Apostle who was so powerful that his handkerchiefs and aprons were healing the sick, you will see that when he beheld Christ on his way to Damascus, as he hit the ground, he said “What do you want me to do Lord?” That is total surrender from the onset. You hear him say in Galatians 2:20: <i>“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”</i><br><br>In other words, He was saying, “Forget the Paul you used to know, forget all you knew about me; the only reason I am living now is that Christ is living in me.” This is why he said in Philippians 1:21, “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”<br><br>By God’s special grace, He has done so many great things through me that make me glad that I surrendered all to Him. These are things that outweigh the pain of total surrender.<br><br>Some people want God to use them, but they still tell lies once in a while. Some want to heal the sick but their money is too precious for God to take from them. Some want to command demons but even the devil is looking at them and saying, “From your sinful mouth? You think you can command me?”<br><br>Take your focus off the things of this world that distract you and surrender your all to God. Pray without ceasing, study your Bible regularly, fast often - just go all in with God. Let Him know that you are His and His alone. Don’t worry about the things you are chasing now -  Jesus Christ promised in Matthew 19:29: <i>“And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.”</i> I can attest to that promise because He has fulfilled it in my life.

However, if the doctor comes, observes the patient and says “You will be going home today”, then the patient can begin to rejoice. The One who gave you promises at the beginning of the year is He, who is called the Truth according to John 14:6. Numbers 23:19 says: <i>“God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?”</i><br><br>This God is called the Most High and the Almighty so there is nothing He cannot do. <br><br>He has shown up at the last minute for many people before.

In Matthew 8:1-3, when He was going to heal another leper, He touched him and he was cured.

      "God’s banking system is a unique one. It is not like the banks we have in the world, where you have to deposit money before you can withdraw. The banking system of the world deducts interests and fees such that you would only be able to withdraw less than the amount you deposited. In God’s banking system, all you need is a relationship with Him - the Owner and you can get permission to withdraw from His bank. For some, He could give unlimited access to withdrawals, for some, He could give as much as they can carry per time, while for yet another set, He would just let them withdraw what they need per time. I don’t know about you, but I want Him to give me unlimited access to withdraw from His bank.<br><br>In 1 Kings 17:8-16, there is the case of a widow who gave her last meal to the prophet of God and from that day on, for over three years, there was abundant supply of food in her house every single day. That was unlimited withdrawal. In 2 Kings 4:1-7, there was another widow who was in serious need. The Lord granted her access to withdraw oil from His bank and as soon as she had filled all the vessels she could had, the supply of oil stopped. That was withdrawal according to her capacity. In Matthew 17:24-27, when some people asked Peter for Jesus’ tax, the Lord told Peter to go fishing and pick money for their taxes from the mouth of the first fish he would catch. That was a case of withdrawal according to the need at hand. <br><br>My Father-in-the-Lord - Pa Josiah Akindayomi, the founder of the Redeemed Christian Church of God told how, one day, he cried to God for provision of food and the Lord said  “Tell your wife that from that pot of soup, she should just go on dishing every day, but she must not look inside”. He told his wife what the Lord had said and from that day, there was unlimited supply of all kinds of soup from the pot, until the day she was overcome by curiosity. She looked into the pot and found it empty. This was also withdrawal according to the need at hand.<br><br>Beloved, to be able to make withdrawals from God's bank, you nust first and foremost establish a relationship with Him by accepting Jesus as your Lord and saviour.",

Daniel was later given the same task and he said “Give me some time; I have a God who can reveal the deepest knowledge that no one else has ever accessed.” He got home, called his friends and they began to pray, then that night, God revealed the king’s dream and the interpretation, to him. This made Daniel say in Daniel 2:21: <i>‘And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding”.</i><br><br>I have good news for any student reading this now: that particular subject that you find difficult is the one in which you will get a record-setting score. Every believer operating in any sphere of life needs God to reveal concealed things to him or her. In 2 Kings 6:9-20, Elisha was the saving grace of the king of Israel. If it wasn’t for Elisha, the king would have run into the ambush set for him by the king of Syria.<br><br>If you are a politician or just someone in governance, you need to pray to God to always reveal concealed things to you. Business men also need God to reveal concealed things to them. In fact, God promised in Isaiah 45:3:<br><br><b>And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.</b><br><br>There are hidden riches in secret places that you need God to reveal to you. He could reveal such to you by way of an idea, but the moment you pursue it, you would discover great riches in it. A man with financial challenges prayed to God for help and the Lord told him to start making honey-coated peanuts. The man obeyed the Lord and now rides around in his own private jets.",

      "Today is Christmas Day and I am sure many christians around are celebrating and planning some Christmas chicken.. That is fine, but please don’t forget to give the Celebrant of the day His own ‘Christmas chicken’ too - something He can also celebrate about. Our memory verse for today says there is rejoicing in heaven over every soul who comes to Christ. If you win a soul, then a feast would be declared in heaven because of you.<br><br>All Jesus wants is for His coming to the world (which we are all celebrating today) not to be in vain. Tell someone about Christ during this season. When you post pictures on social media, add a message there that you know will hit unbelievers. When you give to the poor during this season, chip in a message about the gospel. When you are sending celebratory messages out, put something about salvation in it. I will give you templates you can adopt or adapt here <br><br>For text messages to loved ones: Merry Christmas. Today, we celebrate the first coming of Jesus Christ when He came to give us salvation. Very soon, He will be back again to take His children to heaven. If He comes tomorrow, will you be raptured with Him or left behind?<br><br>For social media: Today is a beautiful day because we are celebrating the birth of the Saviour of the world. I am assured of spending eternity in heaven because I gave my life to Him and I live holy. Where will you be spending eternity when rapture takes place? confess him as your Lord and saviour today. <br><br>For everyone that will send these messages or a variation of them, you will make heaven rejoice today. I don’t think there is a better way to celebrate Christmas than to please the One we are celebrating and believe me honestly, Jesus will smile at you today for doing this. As for me, Christmas and Easter are major periods for evangelism. I am always out giving heaven reasons to rejoice on these days and in return, Jesus has been giving me reasons to rejoice also. Don’t you want th same? Merry Christmas.",

      "A blessing is a manifestation of all the forces in heaven, on earth and under the earth helping someone. When God blesses someone, everything – family, career, finance and so on will be working well for that fellow. If you really want God to bless you, you need to know how to attract His blessings. Psalm 115:3 says God is sovereign, He does as He pleases. He can bless anybody He wants; He can bless the younger more than the elder, He is God.<br><br>In Deuteronomy 28:2 the word of God made it clear: <i>“And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God”.</i><br><br>Deuteronomy 11:26-28 says further: <br><br><b>Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.</b><br><br>The choice you make between living holy and committing sin determines what you attract to your life - whether blessings or curses. If you live holy, you would attract God’s blessings, if you choose to live in sin, you would attract curses. Which one will you choose?<br><br>Blessings don’t come without a cause. In Genesis 27:1-4, Isaac told Esau to go and prepare a very nice meal that would satisfy him, so that he could bless the boy before dying. Though it was Esau that was to be blessed, Jacob who brought the meal first, got the blessing. He provoked the blessing upon himself by doing something to please his father. If you want God to bless you, please Him. The only way to do this is to live a life of holiness. If you refuse to live holy, forget about attracting the blessings of God.<br><br>Don’t mistake money for blessings. A truly blessed man has peace all round.",

      "Believe it or not, you can attract so much of God’s blessings to yourself that at a point, you would say “God this is too much”. Whether you believe that is possible or not, I decree that in the new year coming, you will be telling God “Lord, these blessings are too many”. That is your portion, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>Many years ago, God asked me to sacrifice my first car and I did. After some time, somebody bought me a Mercedes Benz car. In those days, everybody believed that if you are a child of God, you were to remain poor, so  I locked it up  in the garage. After some time, God visited me in the night and said, “Son, why are you delaying the blessings of my daughter who gave you the car? You had better use it now, because a bigger one is coming”.<br><br>At 3 a.m. one morning, a man came and said “I couldn’t sleep; God said I should give you my car”. I came out to see the car and it was this long limousine with six doors. I laughed! After the man had left, I said to God, “Daddy, you know that even if I am dead and they put me inside this one, I will jump out of it, so there is no way I can use this. Will you please allow me to sell it and use the money for something else?” He said “No problem”.<br><br>However, God was not done. In a single day, a man came with three Mercedes Benz cars. He said, “God said I should give these to you”. I said “God what is happening? What am I going to do? These blessings are becoming an embarrassment”. The Lord then said to me “My son, you haven’t seen anything yet. The only way I can stop blessing you is if you stop living holy”. Now, since I cannot stop living holy because I am going to heaven, those who think I am already blessed haven’t seen anything yet; there is more coming by God’s grace.<br><br>You don’t know what you miss when you refuse to live holy. I advise you to try it for at least six months and you would see how things will change for you completely. When God sees holiness in the life of a person, He pours His blessings on him or her in abundance.",

There are many Pastors who preach ‘powerful’ sermons on the altar, but at home, they don’t practice what they preach. Talk is cheap, that is why only cheap people stay on the level of talk.<br><br>If I tell someone that over-speeding when driving is unsafe and then I do the same, does the fact that I talk about it exempt me from its consequences? If you talk about prayer so well and you don’t pray, all the problems that follow prayerlessness will keep following you. This is why we see many people who are sound in Scriptures, yet the word of God does not seem to be yielding anything in their lives. Many a time, it is because they only know the Scriptures, they don’t live by it.<br><br><b>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach.</b><br><br>Acts 1:1<br><br>The above passage shows how Jesus lived.

We who teach the gospel must note what James 3:1 says that teachers will receive the strictest judgement. This is because if you teach it, God expects you to have already been doing it. When you teach what you don’t do, then God has a problem with it. There are many people who are derailed when they see a teacher of the word not practicing what he or she preaches. May people not go to hell because you showed them the wrong example, in Jesus’ name.

The implication of that is this: before your problem started, God had provided the solution. Whatever may be the nature of your problem, the solution is already waiting. All you need from God is guidance on what the solution is and how to use it. Psalm 90:2 says: <i>“Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.”</i><br><br>God has been there before whatever mountain might be blocking you, so He can uproot it easily. <br><br>The good thing is that God is not only the Alpha, He is also the Omega (Revelation 1:8), so He knows the future as well as the past. He knows the things that the devil may be planning for you in 2024 and so will provide all you need to tackle him and overcome in the new year, even from now, in Jesus’ name.<br><br>He has already put in you all that you need to overcome in 2024. Fear not. Before Goliath started terrorising Israel, the stone that would kill him had been formed, waiting for when David would pick it up, put it in his catapult and shoot it at the giant. Before the Philistines came for Samson, the jaw bone of the ass was already there, waiting. Before 2024 arrives, the things you will need to overcome in the new year are already available to you. The tree that will turn bitter water to sweet had been there before the Israelites got to Marah; all that happened when Moses cried unto God is that light shone on a particular tree and God told Moses what should be done with it.<br><br>Isaiah 30:21 says that when you find yourself at a crossroads, you would hear a word behind you, showing you the way. I pray  that the way by which you will walk successfully through 2024 will be revealed to you today, in Jesus’ name.

      "Proverbs 1:17-19 says he who is greedy of gain lays wait for his own blood. He ambushes his own life. God says you are waiting to destroy your own life when you are greedy. Proverbs 15:27 says the one who is greedy of gain troubleth his own house. You create a problem for your family when you are greedy. Children can get into trouble because their parents have been greedy.<br><br>Several years ago when we were starting a parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Zambia, a native who was supposed to be our representative was collecting money for the purpose of building the Church and diverting it to His private use. One day, his daughter was playing with their door – a little one installed to stop goats from gaining entrance into the house while fresh air and illumination can come in from the top. Suddenly the door broke off and a loose nail from it pierced the girl’s eye and plucked it out.  I prayed for the child, reminding the Lord of her father’s service in the Church. The Lord said I should ask him certain things. I did, further telling him about what God would do if he lied. With his head down, trembling, he said “I have not been faithful. I have been misappropriating the money sent to me to build the church”.<br><br>Those who are greedy may show off their ill-gotten wealth and parade themselves as smart, but as the word of God stands sure, their real pain is on its way. Some are already going through their own pain and are hiding it from the whole world. Don’t get tempted to become like them because you don’t know the sufferings they are hiding in the background.<br><br>Greed is an invitation to take unlawfully what is not yours. The interesting thing is, that thing you are greedily desiring can be yours if only you will patiently go through the right process. Those who allow greed to override contentment in their lives will eventually lose what they have. The devil was an archangel but lost it all because he was greedy for what could never be his. A greedy fellow has no gratitude for God's blessings in his or her life and believes in snatching what belongs to others. <br><br>Think about all God has done for you this year and express your gratitude to Him so he can do more for you in 2024",

For example, when the wine finished at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, He didn’t only change water to wine; the new wine was better than what they had before. When Jesus stepped onto the scene, He gave them an entirely new experience, and the governor of the ceremony confirmed it (John 2:1-10). Jesus will do the same for you in this new year, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus can give you a brand-new beginning. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says that if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away, and all things have become new. All that God requires for everything in your life to become new is for you to surrender to Him. This is because, for the new to come, you must do away with the old.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Jacob was faced with the fear of meeting his twin brother, Esau, after so many years, he had a divine encounter that changed his old name into a new one – Israel. That change of name ushered in the miracle of reconciliation that he wanted because as long as he still bore his old name, he couldn’t experience fresh miracles. God also had to change the names of Abraham and Sarah so that His promises concerning their lives would come to pass (Genesis 17:5, 15).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God doesn’t put His new wine into old wineskins of sin (Luke 5:37-38). For Him to make all things new in your life, you must be ready to let go of the old man. You must surrender your old ways of thinking to be able to receive and follow His directions for your life. You must surrender your old traditions for His new culture to take over. When it was time for God to draw the Gentiles unto Him, God gave Simon Peter a trance to shift his old way of thinking. He showed him a sheet filled with the birds and animals he termed unclean and asked him to kill and eat. God wanted to change his old mindset so that he could accept the Gentiles into the church (Acts 10:9-16).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is limitless. He can make all things new, but sometimes, our old wineskins stop Him from pouring out His newness into our lives. Beloved, as we still bask in the newness of this year, ask the Lord to reveal every old and faulty mindset that can hinder His new plans from manifesting in your life.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I’ll be concluding my discussion on letting go of all the old things that can limit God from doing new things in your life. I pray that nothing will hinder the new things God has planned for you this year, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For 430 years, the children of Israel were in captivity in Egypt (Exodus 12:40). They were in bondage under Pharaoh and the Egyptians until one night when God decided to bring them out. God did a new thing, and a nation was born in one day. God is not bound by time or any other limitations around us. He said in Jeremiah 32:27 that nothing is too hard for Him to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can do new things in strange ways that will cause men to marvel at His great wonders. It is in the realm of men that we say that there is nothing new; after all, Ecclesiastes 1:9 says that there is nothing new under the sun. However, God dwells above the sun; He dwells in the heavens and does as He pleases (Psalm 115:3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, when God says that He will make all things new, there are certain things He expects from a fellow who is about to enter into His newness. As I mentioned yesterday, God will not put old wine in new wineskins (Luke 5:37-39). Thus, if you are going to enter into the new things that God has in store for you this year, you must be prepared to reposition yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question, however, is, how can you position yourself for the new things that God wants to do in your life? You can reposition yourself through persistent prayers. Jesus once told the story of a widow who wanted a total turnaround in her life. For a long time, she had been tormented by her adversary, and she kept going to the judge for help. Her persistent visits eventually made the judge to arise and help her. Jesus told this story to emphasise the importance of persistent prayers in changing things (Luke 18:1-5). Prayer births new things or levels; it is like a pot in which new things are cooked before they are served.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t let the adversary keep you trapped in your old level. Cry unto God like the Israelites, and He will surely do a new thing in your life (Exodus 3:7-8). Engage the power of prayer to enter into the new things that God has prepared for you and your family in this new year.</p>",

      "<p>There are people who claim to have been called by God, but when you look closely, you will realise that they are only going into ministry because they failed at everything else. Today, I will be discussing some of the things God looks for in the people He calls into service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who will receive the call of God cannot be lazy. God does not call lazy people. If someone is lazy, that fellow is useless to himself or herself. When you look at everyone whom God called in the Bible, you will discover that they were all busy people. Jesus called Peter after he had fished all night – lazy people don't work all night. When Elisha received the call of God through Elijah, he was on the farm plowing with twelve yokes of oxen before him (1 Kings 19:19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God works with the principle He stated in Luke 16:10:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not faithful in the earthly work that you are doing now, God will not commit souls into your hands. Jesus asked in Mark 8:36, “<strong>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</strong>” In other words, He was saying that just one human soul is more valuable than the entire world. Therefore, souls are too precious for Him to commit into the hands of a lazy person.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is not lazy. Jesus Christ said in John 5:17 that His Father works, and He works too. Since Amos 3:3 says that two cannot walk together except they agree, then you cannot work with God if you are lazy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who are lazy and want to serve God in ministry are people who want to eat without working; this is totally against the will of God. 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says that those who do not work should not eat. After God created man, the first thing He gave him was work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</strong></i> Genesis 2:15 &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Scripture above shows how important work is to God. Beloved, the next time you see lazy people claiming that God has called them into ministry, stay away from them because God does not call lazy people.</p>",

      "<p>Nowadays, many see God’s call as a call to a higher social status. Even though God rewards those who work hard to please Him with influence and wealth, His call to service is a call to put Him first in everything. In Matthew 19:16-24, a rich man, who had been careful to obey God’s commandments, approached Jesus and said, “Lord, I have obeyed all your commands, and I have kept all the law, but somehow, I feel that something is missing. What do I lack?” Jesus replied: “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.” On hearing this, he became sorrowful because he had many possessions and obviously valued them more than following Jesus. Beloved, when God calls you, following Him must be your only focus, and you should be ready to surrender anything He asks of you, including your life (Luke 14:26).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who will heed God’s call must see Him as their only source. This is why in Numbers 18:20, God told Aaron that he would have no inheritance among the Israelites because He would be his inheritance. In Ezekiel 44:28, God said that He would be the inheritance of His priests.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is not against you taking up secular jobs (except He has specifically told you not to); however, He wants you to see Him as your only source. If God calls you, no matter how wealthy or influential you are, He will first take you through a wilderness to be sure that you are serious about serving Him and that you are not just serving Him for material gains. If you lose patience in the wilderness season and start going after material things, you are not fit for the call. This is why we have many half-baked ministers of God today; when God was building them in their wilderness season, they rebelled against Him and found alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who will be used mightily by God must be willing to trust Him wholeheartedly. Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Faith is built when you let go of everything you can rely on and focus on God alone. The good news is, after He has truly seen that your faith is solely in Him, He will begin to raise you up, and when God raises you, there is no limit.</p>",

      "<p>When I see Christians celebrating because they have been promoted to higher positions of influence in God's kingdom, I wonder if they really know what serving God is about. When someone is promoted from leading 10 people to leading 100 people in God's kingdom, such a fellow should be sober. This is because the demons that will be posted to bring him or her down will not only increase in number but also in rank. Also, he or she will become accountable to God for more people. It is tough enough to be accountable for one person, let alone multiple people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Joshua was promoted to become the national leader of Israel, God had to tell him multiple times to be courageous. Why then do people celebrate when they are given greater assignments in the kingdom? Could it be because their focus is not on the work but on the prestige and benefits that come with the new office?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If God puts you in charge of the souls of men, you must recognise that at the end of your life here on earth, you will give account to God for every soul that He put in your care. In John 17:12, Jesus said:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Jesus could give an account of the people in His care while He was on the earth, how much more His disciples? This is why James 3:1 says that the judgement for those who are leaders in His kingdom will be greater than that of others. Therefore, the more people you are teaching the word of God and discipling, the more people you will have to account for. This invariably means that when God promotes you, you have to work, fast, and pray more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was pastoring just a few people within one state in Nigeria, I used to sleep all night. During this period, one day, I saw my Father-in-the-Lord praying all night, and I was worried. In the morning, I asked him if all was well. He laughed and told me that I would understand later. Now, I understand because all-night prayers have also become my lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you serve God, He will promote you, however, you must take the promotion as an opportunity to work harder.</p>",

When people are unserious with their lives, even though they are advancing in age, they are called agba iya.

No matter how much you have achieved in the past, you must keep pushing until you see the Lord in glory (Philippians 3:13-14).

The soldiers started a fire and said that those who would deny Jesus could come out of the pond and warm themselves by the fire. Slowly, the boys started freezing, and at a point, one of them called out to the soldiers and said that he was ready to deny Jesus. As one of the soldiers went to get him out, the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw five angels holding crowns, one for each of the boys. However, the angel holding the crown of the boy who had denied Jesus was turning back to return with the crown.

Jotham had escaped being killed by his brother, Abimelech, who had killed seventy of his brothers, and he responded by placing a curse on Abimelech and the men of Shechem who helped him. Three years later, God allowed an evil spirit to execute the curse, leading to chaos and destruction in the land and, ultimately, Abimelech's death.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I heard a story when I was young that helped shape my actions as I grew older. It was reported that a young man who was travelling on a journey passed by an old man and laughed mockingly at him for no reason. The old man responded by saying, “I may be too weak to do anything, but the basket is never satisfied with water.” After saying this, he continued on his way. Suddenly, the young man felt an intense thirst, so he rushed to the nearest hut to drink some water before continuing his journey. Shortly after, he became thirsty again, and he stopped at another hut to drink more water. After many more similar stops, some people sensed that something was amiss.

The power of a blessing or a curse is dependent on the spiritual authority of the fellow who is placing the blessing or curse. Since God is higher than the highest, a curse from Him is so potent that nothing can break the curse except God Himself. Since there is no remedy to a curse from God, any wise fellow will avoid anything that will make God curse him or her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since God placed a curse on the ground after the fall of Adam (Genesis 3:17), man has had to toil and sweat on it with limited returns. I pray that you will make it to the millennial reign of Christ because by then, we will be having robust harvests monthly and not the little yearly harvests we are having now (Revelation 22:2-3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you read the story of Cain in Genesis 4:9-15, you will notice that the moment God cursed him, everyone he encountered wanted to harm him, even without provocation. When you read the Scriptures and come across something that God forbids or that would attract a curse from Him, you should stay away from such a thing. For example, He said in Malachi 3:8-10 that those who don’t pay their tithes are robbing God, and they will attract a curse on themselves. Even without the promise of overflowing blessings for paying your tithe, the curse alone should make you pay your tithes faithfully. Also, in Deuteronomy 28:15-20, God said that if the children of Israel did not hearken to His voice and obey His commandments, certain curses shall come upon them and overtake them. This is why you must ensure that you live a life that is in total obedience to God’s commandments and principles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, when you meet a true Christian, a descendant of Abraham by faith, don’t try to place a curse on such a fellow because the result will be that you will attract God’s curse on yourself (Genesis 12:3). Beloved, God’s curses are very terrible, and they are irreversible except if He has mercy on you. Do all you can to avoid God’s curses.</p>",

The best thing that can happen to anyone is for God to bless him or her. When God blesses you, every force in heaven, on earth, and underneath the earth will work to favour you. Also, there will be no sorrow added to the blessing (Proverbs 10:22).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are several passages in the Scriptures that talk about the blessings of God and how you can attract them. Unfortunately, many Christians just read about the blessings and claim them without paying attention to what to do to attract them. Owing to my training in mathematics, whenever I see a blessing in the Bible, I always want to know what the condition of getting that blessing is. I know that if the conditions are not right, no matter how hard I try, I will not get the desired result. Therefore, I always pay more attention to the conditions needed for God’s blessings than the blessings themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deuteronomy 28:1-14 is filled with many blessings that God has promised us.

If God looks at you and sees no sin, you are already blessed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</strong></i> Romans 4:8&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To attract God’s blessings, you must live a holy life. You cannot continue going against God’s word and expect Him to keep blessing you. When you start living a holy life, you will discover the real meaning of God’s blessings. I thought I was successful before I met Christ; I was a young lecturer at the university, growing steadily in my career. However, no matter how much my salary was, by the middle of the next month, I would be borrowing money from my driver to fuel my car. Then, I met Christ and started living a holy life. He blessed me, and all of a sudden, the same salary that wasn’t usually sufficient became enough to cater for my needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, start living a holy life from today, and you will see the real meaning of being blessed.</p>",

      "<p>God is a jealous God (Deuteronomy 4:24); He never wants anything to take His place in your heart. God wants you to love Him wholeheartedly (Luke 10:25-28), and at different times, He will test you to see if you really love Him as you should. Your response in those moments will show whether you truly love Him or not. The tests may hurt or excite you, but you must not feel so hurt that you deny Christ or become so excited that you forget Him. You must keep Him as your only focus at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If God decides to test you, He might take you through a painful experience to see if it will cause you to deny Him as He did with Job (Job 1). On the other hand, He may decide to bless you with something big to see your reaction. If you are still obedient and submissive to Him afterwards, He will then give you more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, during one of our services, God told me to announce that three breakthroughs were coming for someone. The first was to be given to Him, the second was to be shared equally between Him and the fellow, and the third was for the fellow concerned. After a few weeks, a widow came to me, saying that she had brought the proceeds of the first breakthrough. I knew she was struggling because her husband owed the bank a lot of money before he died, which she had to repay. Therefore, I told her that the prophecy may not have been for her. She insisted, so I collected the money from her and kept it aside just in case she came back for it. Not long after, the bank called her to apologise, saying that they were the ones owing her husband a lot of money, which they paid her. God tested her with a little breakthrough, and when she passed the test, He brought something big her way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you need to note that God will never allow you to be tested beyond what you can handle, and with every test, He supplies the grace that is required to pass it (1 Corinthians 10:13). To pass God’s test, you must use the grace that He supplies to you. May you not fail when your love for God is tested, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>In today’s Bible reading, the children of Israel were close to the promised land, but a mighty wall stood in their way. Joshua knew that their progress would be affected by the wall, and God gave him the strategy to bring the wall down and lead His people into what He had prepared for them. When it feels like something is obstructing your access to God’s promises, you first need to identify exactly what it is so you can ask God for the strategy to overcome what is hindering your progress. If you have not identified what is stopping your progress, you may be fighting the wrong battles while the actual enemy remains unchallenged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, the forces of darkness are the wall of Jericho that hinders the progress of people since the devil’s only job is to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). If you notice that something bigger than you is blocking your way when you are about to succeed in an endeavour, you need to pray against that force. The good news is, Isaiah 54:17 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are a child of God and you’re serving Him diligently, you have the legal right to condemn whatever forces that may arise against you. Some of these evil forces are stubborn and will not stop if you tell them to go just once. Hence, you need to pray and fast persistently before they go. Jesus said in Mark 9:29 that some demons cannot be overcome except by prayer and fasting. If you have done all these and you still cannot see any change, you probably need to find someone who can join you in prayers so you can engage in the prayer of agreement. Deuteronomy 32:30 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also ask a minister of God with higher authority to pray for you. After taking these steps, there is no force that can stand in your way.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue the discussion I started yesterday on the factors that can hinder a person’s progress. Sometimes, the wall hindering your progress could be someone you have a relationship with. Many people don’t know it, but sometimes, even the people you love may be a hindrance to your progress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Genesis 12:1-5, Abraham took Lot with him when God called him to leave his family behind and go to a place that He would show him. However, it wasn’t until Lot separated from him in Genesis 13:14-17 that God spoke and showed him the land He had promised.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spiritual authority a person submits to can also hinder the fellow’s progress (1 Kings 13:1-24). This is why you must carefully choose your spiritual father or mentor with the Holy Spirit’s guidance. John 15:20 says that the servant cannot be greater than the master. Whomever you choose to be your master will determine how far you can go. Prayerfully choose someone who is constantly growing so that there won’t be a limit to your progress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another kind of person that can be a wall of Jericho that is hindering your progress is your friend. To a great extent, those you call your friends will determine how far you will go in life. This was why Solomon warned his son in Proverbs 1:10-15 not to keep company with certain kinds of friends.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I became born again, one of the first things I did was to change my friends. It was painful, but if I had remained in their company, I would never have come this far in life. Amnon would have lived a long and good life as a son of David, but he ended up badly because he had the wrong friend. In 2 Samuel 13:3, the Bible says, <strong>“But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab...”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are some people who pose as friends but are actually like the wall of Jericho. If you have such friends, stay away from them because they are enemies of progress. If you have a friend who you only gossip with, but you never pray or discuss the Bible, that friend will become a hindrance to your progress. If you have friends whose pieces of advice are always contrary to what the Bible says and are always encouraging you to reduce your dedication to God, such friends are a wall of Jericho between you and God’s perfect plan for your life. Beloved, please run away from such friends.</p>",

      "<p>As I conclude my discussion on the forces that can obstruct a person’s progress, I want you to know that the real wall of Jericho hindering people’s progress may actually be they themselves and not necessarily a spiritual force or a relationship. No matter how much support such people get in order to progress in life, if they have certain bad habits or traits, they will still not make progress. Romans 8:31 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer to the above question is ‘we ourselves’. Even if the Almighty God is for you, you must ensure that you are not against yourself. Certain negative traits can make a fellow work against himself or herself in the journey of life. These traits are hindrances to progress. For example, laziness is a great hindrance to progress. King Solomon, considered by many to be one of the wisest people who ever lived, said in Proverbs 6:10-11:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we were building what has now become Redemption City, I knew some people who worked with us who were lazy. If only they were hardworking, considering all the work that was done then, they would have been very wealthy by now. Nobody wants to give opportunities to a lazy fellow. This is because lazy people will eventually waste the opportunities that are given to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another trait that can be a wall of Jericho to a person is talkativeness. Proverbs 29:20 says that a fool has more hope for tomorrow than the one who is always quick to talk.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dishonesty is yet another trait that can be a wall of Jericho to a fellow and hinder his or her success. This is because nobody will trust people who lack integrity to handle sensitive responsibilities. Jesus Christ said in Luke 16:10 that whoever is faithful in a little will have more committed into his or her hands. If you say one thing and turn around to do something completely opposite, it will be difficult for you to have access to the things that you have been asking and trusting God for.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, be wise. Don’t be the wall of Jericho in the path of your progress.</p>",

Rather, they regularly ask the people around them for feedback to know if they are on the right track or not. In Matthew 16:13, Jesus Christ asked His disciples, “Whom do men say that I am?” In other words, He was asking, “Based on my character and words, what is the impression that I give people about myself?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is important that you regularly give people the opportunity to tell you what they think of you, especially when you are a leader.

Jesus Christ spent only three-and-a-half years with His disciples, but by the time He left, they had been so transformed that they were just like people who had gotten formal education (Acts 4:13). When someone has spent some time with you, can other people notice a positive difference in him or her?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible says that if you delicately bring up a servant from childhood, that servant will later become a son to you (Proverbs 29:21). Childhood here refers to a time when a person doesn’t understand much about life. If you have people working with you, raise them like they are your children. Correct them when the need arises, teach them the things they need to learn and don’t give up on them while they are still working on their weaknesses.

However, the Lord helped me to train them. I didn’t give up on them, and after a while, they became like sons to me, handling sensitive assignments. If you want to be successful as a leader, you have to learn to invest in people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Yorubaland, an adage says that the one whose children will be many cannot be short-tempered. Sometimes, the reason people are lonely is that they have driven the children God sent to them out of their lives by their intolerance. There are many people with great potential out there that can become great if someone trains them. However, this is not to say that you should continue to tolerate people who persistently do terrible things or engage in criminal acts. After many warnings and efforts to change such people, if they refuse to change, you can handle the case as Paul did in 1 Corinthians 5:5. However, if people are generally of good behaviour but have some negative traits and are willing to become better, don’t use your impatience to throw them out into the world.</p>",

When she was set to deliver, her husband asked the doctors to perform a Caesarean Section on her.

      "<p>Romans 10:17 says that faith comes by hearing God's word. Revelation 12:11 also tells us that testimonies are powerful weapons that can defeat the devil. This is why I keep sharing testimonies. I have discovered that many people don't often remember the Bible passages I quote during my sermons, but they remember the testimonies. When you look back at the things the Lord has done, you become confident that you can overcome any obstruction that may come your way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Samuel 17:1-51, when David confronted Goliath, his testimonies gave him the assurance that he would win. He said, “The God who delivered me from the lion and the bear will deal with Goliath.” God has kept you alive until now, and He will keep you unto the end, in Jesus' name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bartimaeus, in Mark 10:46-52, was a blind man who was begging by the roadside. He heard that Jesus was passing by and began to cry for help. How did he know that Jesus can open blind eyes? I'm sure it was because he had heard testimonies of miracles that Jesus had performed. So, when he heard that the same Jesus was passing by, he knew that his miracle had come.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Several years ago, I shared a testimony about how my wife delivered a baby naturally after she had delivered three of our children through Caesarean Sections. The doctor had told us, “No more babies,” and we agreed. Thereafter, we became born again, and one day, I read the Bible passage that says, “…with God nothing shall be impossible,” and I believed it. My wife and I agreed that we would have another child, and this time, we would not involve any doctor. The baby was born safely by God's grace. I shared the testimony for the first time in Kaduna, a state in Northern Nigeria, as I preached a message titled, ‘10 steps to your miracle’ (The original sermon note I used can be accessed in the Open Heavens International Centre). A woman who attended the programme wrote all the steps in her notebook. She had undergone two Caesarean Sections and was pregnant with her third baby. When she was about to give birth, she took the notebook and began to follow the steps. While she was still acting on the steps, the baby came.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). If you have heard someone share a testimony concerning whatever situation you are going through, have faith that your miracle will also come.</p>",

      "<p>After Jesus was crucified, Peter thought that it was the end of His ministry on the earth. Therefore, in John 21:3, he told his colleagues, “You know what, if I can’t go forward, at least I can return to where I am coming from. Brethren, I am going back to fishing,” and they decided to follow him. However, while he was fishing, the Lord met him and restored him. The same Peter, who thought that the end had come in his walk with Christ, began to heal the sick with his shadow, as we see in Acts 5:15:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have failed God at one time or the other, or you feel that God cannot use you again because of the sins you have committed, let me tell you, if you repent and forsake your old ways, God can still use you mightily. He specialises in using the most unlikely people in powerful measures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t be like Samson, who disappointed God. He deviated from the path that God laid out for him and started engaging in sin. Eventually, the enemy captured him, and he lost the connection he had with God. However, when he prayed to the One whose mercies are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23), that connection was restored. Not only was the connection restored, Samson also received the power he had lost. In one day, he killed more Philistines than he had killed in his entire life. God had apparently forgiven and restored Samson, but he never forgave himself, and so, he asked to die along with his enemies (Judges 16:17-30). If you are backslidden, the Lord can still restore you if you will allow Him to. Go back to Him in prayers, start studying your Bible, and begin to walk with Him in obedience in fellowship with other Christians. You will see that as you take one step towards Him, He will take 99 steps towards you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen many backsliders completely restored by God. In fact, you will never know that they were once backslidden. When they genuinely repented, God took charge of their lives and used them powerfully. Beloved, if you have strayed from God’s path, He can do the same for you if you repent genuinely and come back to Him.</p>",

Today’s Bible reading says that while it will be well with the righteous, it shall be ill with the wicked. No matter your past, as long as you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour and you’re living according to His will, you have been made righteous, and it will be well with you. Those who aren’t born again cannot be righteous; God sees them as wicked (John 3:18-21), and He has said that it shall not be well with them (Isaiah 3:11).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I always tell my children at the beginning of each year, “It’s going to be well with me this year.” I know this because the One who said that it shall be well with the righteous never discriminates.

Those who refuse to be connected to Jesus cannot see His promises fulfilled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A man once asked me to tell him about his future, and I replied, “That is easy. Are you born again?” He answered, “No.” I then told him that his future would be terrible. He said, “How do you know? You don’t even know me, neither do you know my name. You’ve not even prayed.” I then said, “That is unnecessary. Isaiah 3:11 says, ‘Woe to the wicked, for it shall be ill with him.’” Then, he said, “What if I said I am born again?” I replied, “I would have told you that your tomorrow will be alright.” He then said, “What if I am willing to be a child of God now?” I replied, “Your tomorrow will be alright.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is not a respecter of persons (Romans 2:11); no matter your background, His word is true for everybody.</p>",

Then, one man got up and said, “Brothers and sisters, please give very generously this evening because the total amount you all give is what my wife and I will give.” There were about 17,500 people in attendance. When the offering was counted, it amounted to about $3.5million. He got up again and said, “Brethren, is this all you can do?” I said to myself, “This fellow knows something that I do not know,” so I cornered him after the meeting and asked, “What is your secret?” He said, “Five years ago, I started a business with $500, and I told God, ‘This company is Your company. I will not insult You by giving You 10 percent; I will keep 10 percent, and You will have 90 percent. It is up to You to prosper the company if You want to.’” He continued, “Sir, today, I have a turnover of $50million.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I learnt a major lesson that day. Though I do not give God 90 percent yet, I am on my way, and He has already blessed me beyond my expectations. If you see someone walking in glory, try and find out what their story is. If you see someone prospering much more than you, and you are both children of the same heavenly Father, find out their secret.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible says that God blessed Abraham in everything (Genesis 24:1). He was rich in cattle, houses, lands, and servants. Today, billions of Christians say, “Abraham’s blessings are mine.” However, the same Abraham was willing to sacrifice his only son at God’s instruction (Genesis 22:10). He also obeyed God to leave his father’s house to an unknown land (Genesis 12:4), lived in tents in the land God showed him, refusing to become attached to anything God blessed him with (Hebrews 11:9), and gave tithes to God (Genesis 14:20). Those who will enjoy the blessings of Abraham must do his works.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there’s always a story behind every glory. Don’t just ask God to give you the glory you see on others who are shining today; try to find out what they did to walk in that glory.</p>",

Shortly after that, she embarked on a journey, and highway robbers stopped her and took her car away. Days later, while she was trying to cook, her kitchen caught fire. All these occurrences happened within a week. Interestingly, the following Sunday was Thanksgiving Sunday, and she danced and rejoiced more than everyone else. Everybody stared at her because she was the last person they expected to be dancing like that. However, she told them, “I lost my job, not my salvation. They stole my car, but they didn’t steal my life. My kitchen caught fire, but I am not going to hell. Whatever the devil has tried, I am still here.” That is the testimony of someone who had an intimate relationship with God before challenges came, and He never lets such people down (Jeremiah 17:7-8).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If anyone tells you that you will never face challenges because you are a Christian, that fellow is not telling you the whole truth. Challenges will come, but your response to them will be determined by how much you love God. If a challenge pushes you away from God, then your love is small. Some people confess their undying love for God, singing that they will always follow Him, whether through storms or fires. However, when challenges come, they forget their confession and turn away from Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If telling the truth about a situation at work will cost you your job, will you lie to save your job or tell the truth and bear the consequences? You may claim now that you will always tell the truth, but what will really determine what you will do in that situation is your love for God now. Your love for Him must be built from today if you will remain standing in the face of challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Daniel 3, the three Hebrew boys were confronted with the option to either bow to an idol or be thrown into fire. They chose fire, and that shows real love for God. That love was not cultivated on the day the king gave the command for them to bow; they had been cultivating it long before then.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, build your love for Christ now. Study your Bible diligently, pray without ceasing, and keep fellowshipping with other Christians so that when the day of adversity comes, your love for God will keep you standing.</p>",

      "<p><i><strong>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</strong></i> <strong>Mark 9:23&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometime ago, we had a Holy Ghost night in Canada. After the programme, some people rushed to touch the chair I sat on. However, one particular woman didn’t bother; she just went to my wife’s chair, knelt there, and prayed to God. The doctors had told her that she had no womb and that she shouldn’t bother trying to have children. While on her knees, she said, “Lord, the woman who sat here has a womb, and she doesn’t need it anymore. Transfer her womb to me.” By the time she came to testify, she had given birth to five children. She miraculously had a womb transplant by just touching the chair of the original owner of the womb. This is just one of the little things that God can do. He resurrected a dead man after four days in John 11; there is absolutely nothing that God cannot do. One major thing that can limit His ability to work wonders is unbelief. As powerful as Jesus was during His earthly ministry, He could not perform many miracles in His own hometown because of their unbelief (Matthew 13:58).</p><p>During Jesus’ earthly ministry, He would often say to those that He was about to heal, “Your faith has made you whole” (Mark 5:34). In other words, without faith, they would have remained sick.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That big challenge in front of you can be easily solved by God if only you believe. Praying about a problem is not enough; the real question is, “Do you believe that God can solve it?” I have seen many people pray without believing that they will receive answers to their prayers, and because of their unbelief, they miss out on their miracles. James 1:6- 7 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing is impossible with God; all you have to do is ask Him in faith. Philippians 4:6 says that when you are praying, you should present your requests to God with thanksgiving. In other words, as you are making your request, you should thank Him simultaneously because you know that He has done it already</p>",

      "<p>I became the General Overseer of RCCG about 45 years ago. At that time, the total income of the church was less than my monthly salary from the university I resigned from. The church had 39 other members of staff, and after paying them, there was usually nothing left for the General Overseer. As a human being, I turned to God and said, “Lord, I told You to leave me alone where I was lecturing, afterall, I was already pastoring. After collecting my salary, I always deduct money for food and fuel for my car, and the rest goes to Your work. Now, what I am getting from the government is no longer available, and this is the income of the church. What guarantee do I have that I will survive?” Then, God made me a promise, “Son, I have only one guarantee to give you; wherever you go, I will be with you.” Truly, God hasn’t failed me: in 45 years, I have neither borrowed nor begged. Indeed, God provides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you see someone who cannot testify to the fact that God provides, it is likely that you have found someone who is stingy, even to God. If you pay attention to my story in the first paragraph, you will see that even when I was a lecturer, almost all my money was given to God. Hence, whenever I am in need, He has never failed me. Luke 6:38 says that it is when you give that it shall be given unto you. The widow of Zarephath understood this, so when God, through Prophet Elijah, asked for her last meal, she gave it. In return, she had more than enough food to last her throughout the famine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God has been so gracious to many people such that giving Him all their money is not enough to say ‘thank you’ to Him. Despite this, when He asks them for just a little of what they have, they would say ‘no’. Apart from being stingy to God, a lot of them are also stingy to people around them, especially the less privileged. Proverbs 21:13 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you want God to provide for you, don’t be stingy to His work, men and women of God, those around you, or the poor. The liberal soul will surely be made fat (Proverbs 11:25).</p>",

      "<p>While I was studying for my PhD, I was faced with 186 simultaneous equations, which I had been trying to solve for 18 months. With no solution in sight, it looked like I would have to pick a new problem to solve, meaning that my 18 months of efforts would go to waste. One night, around 10pm, after battling the problem and still not making progress, I decided to read my Bible and go to bed. I was reading Exodus 14, where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, and I heard God’s voice, “That is the solution to your problem.” It didn’t make sense to me that the story of the crossing of the Red Sea would be the solution to a PhD thesis problem. However, God said further, “Go and bring your equations.” I obeyed, and He started teaching me, instructing me to put some equations on the left and some on the right. By the time I finished, I realized that all the ones on the left had something in common, likewise the ones on the right. Then, God said, “Now, solve the equations on the left together and those on the right together. Then, bring the two together.” God taught me Mathematics with the parting of the Red Sea, and after five hours, my thesis was ready. It was so good that the external examiner said that he had no questions for me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God teaches His children through His word. If you are an ardent student of the Bible, every now and then, as you study, He will teach you things that will make difficult situations become easy for you. David said in Psalm 119:105:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, the solution to your problem may come from just simply reading the Bible without necessarily having a man of God lay hands on your head. Unfortunately, many Christians don’t read their Bible, and that is why they continue to struggle with simple problems for many years. Jesus said in John 8:32:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Having a knowledge of the truth through God’s word will ensure that you live victoriously. Students know that if they don’t study their textbooks, they will fail their exams. Your Bible is the textbook of life; study it so that you will not fail in life.</p>",

Today, I want to share with you another dimension of how God teaches His children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During my postgraduate studies at the University of Lagos, my supervisor, an Indian, gave me an assignment just before he travelled. When he returned, I had made significant progress, which made him ask me, “Enoch, I know that you are a Christian, so you wouldn’t lie. Who helped you?” He didn’t believe in God, but he knew that Christians do not lie. I knew that if I said ‘Jesus’, he would laugh at me, so I said, “Professor Emmanuel,” referring to one of the names of Jesus (Matthew 1:23).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you become intimate with God, you will start operating on a level of wisdom and understanding that is above your peers. The closer you are to God, the wiser He will make you. You will begin to answer questions in such a way that it will be obvious to people that you are being taught by God. You will look at difficult situations, and God will impress their solutions in your spirit. By the time you execute the solutions that God gives you, people will think that you are very smart, whereas you only have a teacher who is greater than all teachers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>&nbsp;In Galatians 3:27, the Bible says: For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Yorubaland, where I come from, there is a saying that when the leaf stays long with the soap, it also becomes soap. Being baptised into Christ signifies that you are now one with God. As you grow in Him by praying regularly, fellowshipping with other believers, studying your Bible, evangelising, and so on, you will start living the same way Christ would have if He were still physically on the earth. You will start operating on a level of wisdom that is higher than that of those around you because you have surrendered to God and are completely sold out to Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God is the greatest teacher of all; in Him lies all wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:2-3). If you put your trust in Him and lean not on your understanding (Proverbs 3:5), He will be your teacher.</p>",

He promised to protect you such that not even a strand of your hair will be lost (Luke 21:18).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn’t be alive today if my God is not a protective father, and I can tell you a lot of stories about the numerous times He has protected me from danger. When I moved into the camp that has now grown to become Redemption City with my family, there were snakes everywhere. Some of those snakes were so big that they would fill up the trunk of a Mercedes Benz car. I remember, on one occasion, I entered my children’s room and found a snake there. I don’t know exactly why I went into the room; I just know that God moved me to go there because He wanted to protect my children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God also protects against spiritual forces. So many times, the devil has tried to attack me, especially in the early days of my ministry when we were just learning to deal with a lot of spiritual attacks from the kingdom of darkness. On one occasion during a Holy Ghost Service, there were two witches in the congregation planning to attack me. One spoke to the other and said, “It is time; let us attack him now.” Though there were thousands of people in the congregation, God opened my ears, and I heard them. I stopped the service immediately and asked them to come out if they did not want to incur God’s wrath. To everyone’s surprise, they came out and confessed. If God had not revealed it to me, the story might have been different.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a child of God, you must walk in the consciousness of His protection over you. Don’t be afraid of the arrows of the enemy; they cannot come near you because God protects you. I am so conscious of God’s protection over me that if I am walking and my leg hits a stone, I will turn to Him and say, “Lord, I hope I have not offended you in any way. If I have, please forgive me.” This is because His word says that He will give His angels charge over me so I wouldn’t dash my foot against a stone (Psalm 91:11).</p>",

I have gone through many tough times, and God has always been there to comfort me. Many years ago, I used to know a fantastic young boy; I was very proud of him because of his passion for the things of God such as evangelism and Bible study. During his mandatory National Youth Service programme, he died. When he died, the other Christian Youth Corps members came together and started praying for him to return to life. After a while, he came back to life, sat up and said, “God asked me to come and tell you that you are disturbing Him,” and then he died again. When I heard of his death, I was very sad for weeks. Then, one day, God asked me, “Why are you so sad?” I responded, “Because you took this boy from me.” God replied, “No. You are sad because your boy went to heaven ahead of you. Tell me, if you are going to a new country that you have never been to, wouldn’t you like someone you know to be there, waiting to receive you?” I said, “That is true.” Then He said, “Your boy has only gone ahead of you to receive you when you also get to heaven.” Immediately after that conversation, my spirit was lifted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God said that He will never leave you nor forsake you in Hebrews 13:5, the purpose of that statement is so that you can have comfort in the knowledge that He is with you all the way. If you are currently experiencing heartbreak from any sad occurrence, I can tell you assuredly that Jesus is sitting right beside you, putting His hand around your shoulder and comforting you. You only need to open up to Him so that He can heal your broken heart. He loves you more than you can imagine, and He doesn’t want to see you sad. Allow God to comfort you.</p>",

I was preaching in a town called Warri when suddenly, I saw an open vision. In the vision, I saw that a young boy, who was born blind, received his sight. As I wasn't as mature as I am now, I didn't wait for God to give me the details of the vision before I said, “There is a young boy here who is blind, God wants to open your eyes. Come quickly!” Nobody moved. I continued, “I know what I saw. Maybe it’s your son, and he's at home. Go and bring him quickly; I will wait.” Still, nobody moved. I knew that my God doesn't lie, so I said, “Okay, I will wait for one hour after the service. Maybe you don't want to miss what's going on now. After the service, go and bring the boy.” I waited after the service, but no one brought any boy to me. Sadly, after the time elapsed, I left for Akure, which was my next stop. Because I waited an extra hour for the blind boy, I got there late, and someone else was already preaching when I arrived. Suddenly, while the sermon was going on, an elderly man got up. He had a young boy with him, and they began to move towards the altar. The boy was blind, and as I looked closely, I saw that it was the boy in my vision. The father wanted prayers for his son, but I knew that the protocol officers were going to turn him back, saying, “You can't go to the altar while the preacher is preaching.” I ran towards the officers to say, “Please don't turn them back. I saw this boy in a vision; he is about to receive a miracle.” However, before I got to them, the boy heard my footsteps, turned towards me, and his eyes opened.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God proved Himself mighty in my days of little beginnings, and He has remained faithful up to now.

However, at the end of the day, He turned to her and said, “Woman, great is thy faith.” In other words, He was saying that even if He had not wanted to grant her request, He would grant it because of her great faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you can only have faith, all things are possible to you. When you read through the Bible to study those whom Jesus healed of their sicknesses and diseases, you will notice He often makes this statement – “Thy faith has made thee whole.” In essence, what made them whole was their faith in the fact that Jesus had the power to heal them. Those who didn’t have faith didn’t get many miracles (Matthew 13:58).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you come to Jesus for something, I want you to have it at the top of your mind that the One whom you have approached is the creator of the entire universe. He can snap His fingers, and the whole world will disappear. He once brought water out of a rock. There is absolutely nothing that He cannot do. What you consider as a very big problem is too insignificant to be a problem to Him; just rest in the fact that you have brought the matter to the Almighty God who can do all things (Jeremiah 32:27), and start rejoicing.</p>",

      "<p>A major characteristic of mountain-moving faith is that it also moves the believer. In other words, when you have faith, you’ll begin to make moves in line with your faith. David had faith in God that he would kill Goliath, therefore, he boldly went to meet the king for permission to fight the giant. When Goliath charged at him, David didn’t back down; he ran towards the giant and eventually had Goliath’s head in his hand (1 Samuel 17:51-54). If you truly believe, you’ll start moving towards the outcome you want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I was down with malaria on a day we were to have a Bible study in church, so I stayed back at home. I lay in bed and decided to listen to a sermon. The sermon was about faith, and as if the preacher could see me, he said, “What are you doing on the bed if you know that Jesus’ stripes have already healed you? Get up!” That stirred my faith, so I got up and decided to go to church. My entire body ached, but somehow, I made it to church and sat at the back. During the praise and worship session, I ignored the pains in my body and danced. After a while, I felt the urge to urinate, and by the time I left the toilet, the sickness had vanished.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My Father in the Lord once conducted a revival in our church in Ilorin, a state in Southern Nigeria, and God moved him to say, “If there’s anyone here trusting God for the fruit of the womb, go and buy the appropriate clothes for the gender of the baby you want.” A woman heard this, and when she got home, she bought a cot and clothes for a baby boy, which she displayed for everybody to see. Her neighbours laughed at her, saying that she had gone mad out of her desperation to have a child. She ignored them, held on to the word of the man of God, and nine months later, when the baby boy arrived, it was her turn to laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, start making your own move of faith now. Whatever you are trusting God for, make moves towards it as if you have gotten it already, just like the woman I mentioned in the paragraph above. I declare that the Almighty God will give you a miracle that will surprise everyone around you, in Jesus’ name. However, you have to take a step of faith.</p>",

You would be opening up your heart for demons to come in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A young fellow once went somewhere he shouldn’t have gone to and came back loaded with demons. He couldn’t sit or stand; he could only lie down like a vegetable. He was brought to the RCCG Headquarters, and when I saw him, I was led by the Holy Spirit to say to him, “I want to pray with you. Kneel.” He said, “I can’t kneel.” I then said, “I command you to kneel.” He replied, “In whose name?” I responded, “In the name of Jesus.” He then said, “That’s different” as he knelt down. I prayed for him, cast the demons out of him, and said, “Get up.” He said, “I can’t stand up.” I replied, “I command you to stand up.” He then said, “In whose name?” I responded, “In the name of Jesus.” He again said, "That’s different” and got up. I then told him, “You can go home, have your bath, and go to work.” He replied, “I can’t walk.” I said, "I command you.” He replied, “In whose name?” I responded, “In the name of Jesus.” He walked home by himself and was free from that day on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people are demon-possessed today because they went to the wrong places and associated with the wrong people.

When we did, she said that she stopped coming because ever since she started attending services, she lost the ability to fly in the middle of the night to her coven of witches. Just by attending our services, the spirit of witchcraft in her became paralysed. Just as I mentioned yesterday that people can contact demons by associating with demon-possessed people and staying in demonic environments, people can also become spiritually vibrant by associating with godly people and staying in Spirit-filled atmospheres.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The quality of your association will impact the state of your life. If you are surrounded by people who despise godly things, you can’t expect to enjoy freedom in life. 2 Corinthians 6:14 says you must not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. Anyone you will call your close friend must also be a friend of Jesus. However, if your friends love God and desire His presence fervently, you cannot remain spiritually lukewarm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, what you listen to, watch, and read plays a huge role in how much liberty you will enjoy in all areas of your life. You cannot study the Bible diligently every day and remain in Satan's bondage. As you read God’s word, His light will fill your heart, and you will receive life-saving directions and instructions. As you fellowship with God’s word, you will become enlightened in His ways (Psalm 119:130). Enlightened people cannot be easily deceived or swayed by the devil’s lies. They are not ignorant of the devil’s devices, and therefore, he cannot take advantage of them (2 Corinthians 2:11). Apart from God’s word, you should also fellowship with godly materials, songs, and videos. Let your eyes be fixed on things that will always uplift and strengthen you in God. Fill your environment with godly things that will push you to seek God more and more. As you do this, you will enjoy greater spiritual freedom, and everyone who encounters you will perceive and receive the fresh breath of heaven.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, spend time with people, things, and places where God’s presence abides, because in His presence, there is freedom, joy, and all-round peace and prosperity.</p>",

This does not give you the liberty to sin; rather, it gives you the responsibility to reflect Christ in a perverse world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I once travelled from Ilesa, a town in Western Nigeria, to visit my Father in the Lord in Lagos. As I was driving to see him, I remembered that I shouldn’t visit a man of God empty-handed. When I got to Surulere in Lagos, I saw an orange seller by the roadside and stopped to get some. When I arrived at his place, I presented the oranges, and as he ate the first one, he said, “Ha! This orange is sweet. Did you buy it on the road?” I replied, “Yes sir.” I understood the question; he wanted to know if I bought the oranges on the way before I got to Lagos. I should have told him that I bought them in Surulere, but I said “Yes.” Immediately, I became uncomfortable because the Holy Spirit convicted me. Consequently, I cleared my throat and said, “Papa, the question you asked; the answer is ‘no’. I bought the oranges in Surulere.” The old man looked at me, smiled, and said, “Holy Spirit.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the righteousness of God in Christ, you cannot enjoy sin any longer. You cannot lie conveniently or steal without remorse. Just as Papa knew that it was the Holy Spirit who convicted me, people must see a change in your actions and attitude if you truly carry God’s righteousness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: Matthew 3:8&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John the Baptist made the statement in the Scripture above to the Pharisees and Sadducees who had come to his baptism. He told them that it wasn’t enough to claim to be righteous when their actions contradicted their claims. This applies to you too; your actions should not contradict God’s word. Righteousness means right living; therefore, your lifestyle must reflect God’s standard pattern for life. It must reveal God’s truth, peace, and love to the world. God has a standard which is summarised with this bold message: <strong>“…Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity”</strong> (2 Timothy 2:19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God wants you to be filled with all the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the praise and glory of His name (Philippians 1:11).

Being in prison is just like being a fish in a well. Prisoners are fed, but usually not with the kinds of food they would love to eat. Also, when they are sick, they are treated. I know this because I go to prisons to preach. Prisoners are taken care of and appear to live a seemingly normal life, but their freedom is limited within the walls of the prison.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are in a group or association that you cannot dare to come out of, you are in prison. It may seem like being a part of that cult is giving you some privileges. However, when you look closer, you will see that you have given more than you have gotten from the group. Most times, they will ask you to give things or make sacrifices that would hurt you greatly, including sacrificing your loved ones. Worse still, no matter how terrible what you might be asked to give is, you cannot leave. You may have seen examples of people who tried to leave but died, became mad, or encountered something worse. Often, such associations hold firmly to their members and violently go after those who leave; this is why you need the Great I AM on your side. Beloved, the only way to get out of a prison is when a superior force comes to rescue you. If you are in bondage spiritually, you need Jesus to get you out. Just as the Israelites needed God’s mighty hand to bring them out of Egypt, you also need to cry out to God to bring you out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are neck-deep in any evil association, God can save you when you cry out to Him and repent genuinely (Psalm 79:11). He doesn’t ignore a sincere cry, neither does He despise a broken and contrite heart (Psalm 51:17). He wants to save you now so you can enjoy the true freedom that comes with being a part of His Kingdom. Genuine repentance means giving up everything you have received from the association and denouncing everything about them. You cannot hold onto the devil’s lies and receive God’s freedom.</p>",

In 1 Kings 19:1-8, when things were not going the way Elijah expected them to go, he asked God to kill him. However, in 1 Kings 21:1-24, you will see in verse 20 that Ahab, whom he had been running from, said to him, “Have you found me, my enemy.” The one who was pursuing Elijah was now the one running away from him. In the name of the Lord of hosts, all those who have been pursuing you will run when they see you. Don’t let anybody tell you that your case is hopeless; they are not your God, and they are not the ones who brought you this far.

God is the One who controls times and seasons, and He didn’t bring you this far to abandon you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s word is a treasure chest of hope. Whenever a situation seems hopeless, declare His word. He has said that though your beginning was small, your latter end will greatly increase (Job 8:7). His word also says that nothing is impossible with Him (Luke 1:37). Since God is involved in your life, every impossibility becomes possible, in Jesus’ name. He has promised to bless and increase you and your children greatly (Psalm 115:14). He also said that as long as you follow Him uprightly, your end will be peace (Psalm 37:37).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

He knew that God had helped Israel in Exodus 12:1-51 when He humbled Pharaoh, their oppressor, and set His children free. In the name above every other name, every force that has been holding you down will let you go. If they don’t want to let you go gently, they will release you by force, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel knew that God had helped Israel to cross the Red Sea in Exodus 14. He knew that the Lord spoke through Moses and told him that they would never see the enemies they had seen that night again. He knew that God had helped them in Exodus 15:22-26 when they got to Marah, and they couldn’t drink the water because it was bitter. The Lord had prepared help ahead of time and He turned the bitter water to sweet. Whatever has been causing you to weep will end now, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel also knew that God had helped Israel in Exodus 17:1-6 when they were thirsty; the Almighty God brought water out of the rock. He brought something good out of nothing. Things may be hard right now for many people, but I have good news for you; this year, you will experience God’s help more than ever before, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ebenezer signifies hope. I don’t know how far the journey is, but everything is going to be alright. As long as you are connected to the God who has brought you thus far, He will keep helping you. Ecclesiastes 9:4 says that as long as you are still breathing, there is hope for you. God has not brought you this far to abandon you. He is too faithful to leave you now.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you discouraged, sad, or anxious for a breakthrough? Lay your fears, anxieties, and sorrows down, and put on the garment of hope because Ebenezer is here; He has come to help you.

Begin to laugh and rejoice because your help has come.</p>",

      "<p>The name Jehovah Jireh was coined by Abraham after his experience with God on Mount Moriah. He had gone there to sacrifice Isaac, but God had already provided a lamb for the sacrifice instead of Isaac. He called the name of the place Jehovah Jireh because he was basically saying, “God meets needs before they even arise.” In that passage, Abraham had no idea where the ram came from. In the same vein, you also do not need to know how God will provide for your needs. All you need do is trust Him and know that He will provide.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can send help to you from anywhere, even from places you are not aware of. When I became General Overseer, I visited my village, and a local businessman said to me, “You are a General Overseer now, and there is no house here in the village for your guests to stay in. I will supply you with blocks to build a house, and you can pay me whenever you have the money.” I thought to myself, “Oh, what a miracle from God.” I then built a very small house. However, the day the house was roofed, the businessman sent a messenger to demand immediate payment for the blocks. I didn’t have any money, so I cried to God, “Father, I was not ready to build a house. It was this man who brought the idea to me, and now, I am in trouble. Please help me.” I prayed all night and then fell asleep. In the morning, I had a visitor who said that God told her to travel all the way down from the North to the Redemption Camp to give me an envelope. When she saw me, she asked, “I am looking for the head of this church.” I replied, “That is God.” Then, she said, “I know, but I am looking for His representative.” I said, “That is me.” She then said, “God told me yesterday to bring you this envelope.” I had never met her, and I haven’t seen her again since then. I opened the envelope, and it was the exact amount that I owed the businessman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our God is truly Jehovah Jireh – the Great Provider. You may not know where, when, or how your needs will be met, but rest assured that He will always provide.</p>",

There’s a story I love to tell about three little but distinct fishes that were being terrorised by a mother shark and her baby in the ocean. One day, they called a prayer meeting and invited the Lord to come. When the Lord came, He asked them what the problem was and what they wanted. The first fish said, “I want to have eyes all over my body so I will be able to see the sharks when they are approaching from any angle.” The second fish said, “Lord, give me powerful wings so I can fly out of the ocean when the sharks are pursuing me.” The Lord granted the two fishes their requests, and when He turned to the last fish to ask what it wanted, it said, “All I want is for you to be with me everywhere I go.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the Lord left, the sharks came again, and the fish with many eyes was their first target as it looked beautiful because it had eyes all over its body. The fish saw them coming and swam towards a beach. It saw a pool of water on the beach and jumped into it. Unfortunately, when the sun rose, the pool dried up, and the fish died. When the sharks went after the fish with wings, it flew out of the water, but an eagle that was flying by quickly grabbed and ate it. The third fish remained safe because whenever the mother shark and her baby approached it, they always saw the shadow of a man following it, and this scared them off. The fish that asked for God’s presence survived and thrived in the midst of danger.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God’s presence is your only guarantee against the terrors of life. He alone can keep you safe. Jehovah Shammah means ‘the Lord is there’, and when God is there with you in your office, business, family, or any other area of your life, nothing evil done against you will prosper</p>",

      "<p><i><strong>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Psalm 23:1&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before David confronted Goliath in 1 Samuel 17, he was a shepherd boy in charge of his father’s sheep. One day, a bear came to attack the sheep, and he killed the bear. On another day, a lion came and took a lamb out of the flock; he went after it, delivered the lamb, and killed the lion. David didn’t allow predators to take any of the sheep; he protected them fiercely, even when it meant endangering his life. If David, a mere man, could be so protective of his sheep, how much more the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ? As long as the Lord is your Shepherd, you are assured of supernatural provision, protection, restoration, healing, abundance, and many more divine blessings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the Lord is your shepherd; you are His responsibility. This is why He said in Matthew 6:25-33 that you shouldn’t be worried about what you will eat or wear; just seek Him first, and all the things that people chase after will be added to you naturally.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You must, however, note that only sheep can have the Lord as their shepherd. Matthew 25:32 says that God will separate His sheep from the goats. In that particular Scripture, Jesus used ‘His’ when referring to sheep, but when referring to goats, He used ‘the’. Goats are not for God; only the sheep are His. The question is, are you a sheep?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In John 10:27, Jesus said that His sheep hear His voice. When was the last time you spent time with God to hear His voice? Do you even know His voice? Psalm 100:3 says that the sheep do not belong to themselves; they are like clay in the hands of the potter. According to Matthew 25:33-40, the sheep have love in their hearts; they feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and visit the lonely. Also, the sheep enjoy the Shepherd’s protection when predators attack. Are you a sheep in God’s fold?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The height of a shepherd’s love for his sheep is when he gives his life up for their sake, and Jesus did this when He died on the cross (John 10:11, John 15:13). Beloved, have you accepted the everlasting provision of the Good Shepherd for your salvation? If you haven’t, you need to do so right now. When the Lord is your Shepherd, you have everything you need. Being a sheep in God’s flock is the best thing that can ever happen to you.</p>",

He consulted some occultic people, and they said that there was a man in the Redemption Camp (now Redemption City) whose prayers would not let that happen. The military ruler then instructed soldiers to come and arrest me. In those days, whenever they arrested anyone, that fellow was not likely to return alive. Fortunately for me, I got to know of the plan, and to be honest, I was afraid. I went out to pray that night, and after praising God for a few minutes, I said, “Lord, about this matter,” and God said, “Don’t worry about that; I have settled it. On Friday, during the Holy Ghost Service, tell everyone to wish each other a happy new year.” Even though we were in June, I did as God instructed, and by Monday, the whole country heard the news that the powerful military ruler had died. God rose to fight for me, and I didn’t need to lift a finger. I decree in the name of Jesus, anyone plotting your downfall will fail and fall. No plan of the enemy will prosper against you, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, no weapon formed against you shall prosper (Isaiah 54:17).

Just as He fought for the Israelites and defeated the Amalekites in Exodus 17, He will fight for you. He will save your children from the hands of the enemy and preserve all that concerns you.</p>",

Jehovah Shalom lifts that load off you and gives you peace. Jesus described this in Matthew 11:28:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<i><strong>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What has been troubling you?

The more you know Him, the greater your peace becomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalm 119:165 says,<strong> “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”</strong> This is a promise; as you follow God, you will enjoy great peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Isaiah 54:13, the Almighty God says that He will teach your children, and they will enjoy great peace.

When she checked them, she exclaimed, “Oh God!” She then said that both ears had growths inside, and she encouraged me to go to the hospital. I smiled and told her to give me seven days, after which I would allow her to do whatever needed to be done medically if the growths were still there. I knew that I have a Father who is the Doctor of doctors, so I spoke to Him after she left. I said, “Father, please give me new ears because I need to be able to hear people say ‘amen’ when I pray.” When she returned on the seventh day to look into my ears, she exclaimed again, “Oh God!” But that time around, her exclamation was a positive one because Jehovah Rapha had healed me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you know that it is possible to live without falling sick? Do you know that healing is your bread if you are a child of God? However, for God to be the Lord that heals you, you must diligently hearken to His voice (Exodus 15:26). You must do whatever He tells you to do and obey Him promptly. When the ten lepers saw Jesus and cried out to Him for healing, He asked them to go and show themselves to the priests (Luke 17:11- 14). Doing that was risky because if they got to the priest without being healed, they might have been stoned to death. They took the risk to obey Jesus, and they were healed. Likewise, the man who was born blind received his healing when Jesus asked him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam (John 9:7). He chose to obey Jesus, and he returned with his sight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is God’s will for you to enjoy healing in all areas of your life.

What has He asked you to start doing? Be prompt to obey Him, and you will enjoy healing</p>",

      "<p>Seeds have the potential to become harvests, but not all fulfil that potential. John 12:24 says that except a seed falls to the ground and dies, it abides alone. Every seed remains alone if it is kept in a bag or on a shelf; it can be eaten as it is, but it won’t be multiplied. Isaiah 55:10 says that God gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater. Beloved, you can choose to either be a sower or an eater. If you keep eating everything that comes to you, what then will you sow in order to have a greater harvest?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wise people set apart good seeds to be sown into good soils, and they get great harvests. Money that is put aside for investment is a seed, while the place, person, or business that it is invested in is the soil. The better the soil, the better the harvest will be. You must learn to recognise good soils and water your seeds to ensure they yield the best harvest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next few days, I will discuss the different kinds of soils and the ones you should invest in or avoid. Today, however, I will explain some vital keys to financial wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Job 36:11 tells us a secret to accessing God’s wisdom for financial prosperity: obey and serve Him. When you obey God, He will show you the treasures of darkness and hidden riches in secret places (Isaiah 45:3). How obedient are you to God concerning your finances? Do you honour Him with all He has given you? Do you pay your tithes faithfully? Do you give to the needy and poor?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you obey God, He will give you supernatural ideas that will make you thrive in the midst of famine, just as He gave Isaac. Isaac wanted to relocate when famine hit the land, but God told him to stay put, and he obeyed. His obedience gave him access to God’s wisdom, and despite the famine, he reaped a hundredfold that same year (Genesis 26:1-12).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Job 36:11 also talks about service as a key to God’s wisdom for financial prosperity. How you serve God matters. If you serve Him grudgingly or carelessly, He will not trust you with the wisdom to make wealth. Jesus told us not to cast our pearls before swine (Matthew 7:6-7); He won’t cast His before swine too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, serve God acceptably in reverence and godly fear (Hebrews 12:28), and He will bless you with financial wisdom, among other things.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I explained that the quality of soil determines the level of harvest that a seed can yield. When a seed is planted in some soils, it will not even germinate. In today’s memory verse, we see that some seeds that fell on the wrong kind of soil did not germinate because birds ate them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some scholars have suggested that the wayside refers to money spent on regular wild parties and other similar vices. When people throw parties, people will come, eat, drink, and say ‘thank you’; however, that is where it all ends. Such people might say, “Others will invite me to their parties also.” This is true, but we do not live by parties; we live by daily bread. If you want God’s wisdom for financial prosperity, you must be prudent with your spending.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. Proverbs 21:20&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only fools spend everything they have at once. Some people spend all their earnings recklessly. For example, some unbelievers drink and buy alcohol for others. Such people are unwise because, like the prodigal son, they will eventually be abandoned by those they lavished their money on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The wayside can also refer to actions that expose people’s finances to satanic attacks. In the parable of the sower, the seeds that fell by the wayside were eaten by birds, and as Jesus explained in today’s Bible reading, the birds represent satan. When Christians do not pay their tithes, they are robbing God and throwing their finances on the wayside for satan to devour. Paying your tithes makes the Lord rebuke the devourer for your sake (Malachi 3:8-11).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When believers, including ministers of God, steal God’s money or take anything that doesn’t belong to them without permission from the owners, they are exposing themselves to the devil’s attacks. Someone once said to me, “I learned that your Festival of Life programme in the UK has become very big.” I said, “Yes, sir.” Then, he said, “How much is the church’s income from the service?” When I told him that I didn’t know, he didn’t believe me. I told him that the UK pastors were in charge and that they know that the Bible is clear that anyone who acquires wealth wrongly would die suddenly (Jeremiah 17:11). Those who steal God’s money are inviting satan to feast on their lives and finances.</p>",

      "<p>In continuation of my discussion from yesterday about the different kinds of soils, I will examine stony grounds today. The major problem with a stony ground is that it does not retain water sufficiently for the seeds planted in it to grow. Water is needed for seeds to germinate, even though it is God who will determine the increase (1 Corinthians 3:6-8).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Amos 4:7-8, the Lord said that if He decides to withhold the rain, a city will soon go into famine and will start begging another city, where it has continued to rain, for food. When people invest in ventures that God is not involved in, they are planting seeds on stony grounds. When you consider such ventures carefully, you will realise that they are designed to attract and fool only greedy and desperate people. In my lifetime, I have seen many Ponzi schemes come and go, and I warn those close to me to desist from them. Some listen, but others do not, and they suffer when they lose their money .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is and remains our Supplier; when we apply Biblical principles and work diligently with our hands, He will prosper us. Any investment that goes against Biblical principles, such as hard work, diligence, faithfulness, patience, and contentment, is a stony ground. Those who hasten to be rich will not be innocent, and such people will end up piercing themselves through with many sorrows.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. Proverbs 28:20&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 1 Timothy 6:10&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must guard your heart against greed and covetousness. You must be content with what you have while working diligently so that God can bless the works of your hands. Gehazi, Elisha’s servant, allowed greed to rule him, and he ended up inheriting leprosy. While he could have inherited a double portion of Elisha’s anointing, he subjected himself and his lineage to a lifetime of shame, seclusion, and frustration (2 Kings 5:20-27).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, greed, impatience, and not following God’s instructions can lead you to sow on stony grounds. Sowing on stony grounds cannot produce good harvests; it will only lead to frustration. I pray that the Lord will show you the right places to sow, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my discussion on the different kinds of soils by examining thorny grounds. Thorns are dangerous, and they choke everything they come in contact with. When people lead lifestyles that drain them financially because they want to show off, they are sowing on thorny ground. For example, such people may rent apartments that their income can hardly sustain, buy expensive clothes and jewellery that they cannot afford and get into unnecessary debt just to sustain their fake lifestyles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you live an extravagant life, you are putting your money in thorny ground. An adage says, ‘Cut your coat according to your cloth.’ Beloved, you must learn to live within your means and not make lifestyle decisions based on resources you do not have – some people fall into this trap because of their circle of friends. The Scripture says that blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly (Psalm 1:1). If you have friends who spend lavishly without counting the cost, you might follow suit and end up in debt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thorns can also refer to things that cause pockets to have holes. When the Israelites returned from exile in Babylon, they started building the temple, and at some point, they stopped and concentrated only on building their houses and empires. Haggai rebuked them for becoming self\u0002 centred and neglecting God’s house, telling them that they will never be satisfied with the things they have because of their attitude (Haggai 1:4-6).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God will not release His wisdom for financial abundance to those who will consume the wealth He gives them on their lusts. If all you care about is yourself, you are filling your ground with thorns because selfishness chokes God’s blessings upon a man’s life. Many people pray and fast for financial breakthroughs; however, few receive financial wisdom for such breakthroughs because God cannot trust them not to waste the wealth He gives them on their lusts. Can God trust you to continue to put Him first after He has blessed you financially? Will you still care for His kingdom when you arrive at your desired financial destination?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, ask the Lord to remove any attitude that tends to choke His blessings in your life and promise Him that you will always put Him first so that He can pour His blessings on you.</p>",

This implies that they did not fall by the wayside, they were watered by God, and they were not suffocated by thorns. For you to sow on good ground and reap bountiful harvests, you must do the following:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Honour God with your resources and obey all His principles for financial success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. Proverbs 3:9-10&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Cheerfully support God’s work financially. Giving towards God’s work can be by supporting a kingdom project, blessing a church, or sowing into the lives of God’s servants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 2 Corinthians 9:7&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Give to the poor and the needy. When you stretch out your hands to bless the less privileged, God blesses you in return.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed. Proverbs 19:17, ESV&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Be generous. Generosity attracts God’s blessings; whatever you give to others, you will receive in multiple folds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Proverbs 11:25&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. Wait for God’s instructions before making financial decisions. When you seek His face before making decisions, He will guide you along the right path, but those who hastily make deals or investments without seeking God get their fingers burnt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Proverbs 3:5-6 &nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have been sowing your seeds by the wayside, on stony ground, or among thorns, the good news is that if you change your ways and start living by the principles above, you will experience the harvest that comes from sowing on good ground. I pray that the Lord will restore all that you may have lost from sowing wrongly, and your seeds will produce great harvests from now, in Jesus’ name</p>",

      "<p>The first thing to understand about harvests is that they ultimately come from God. 1 Corinthians 3:6 says, <strong>“I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.”</strong> Also, harvests come in different levels, which Jesus identified as thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold (Mark 4:20).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some Bible scholars believe that a thirtyfold harvest results from giving to the household of faith (Galatians 6:9-10). When you help a fellow Christian, you are sowing into a soil that will bring forth at least thirtyfold. When Dorcas was sowing into the lives of the people in her church, she didn’t know that she would reap a harvest of resurrection. Her seeds were so precious that they sent for Peter to raise her from the dead (Acts 9:36-42).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are Bible scholars who also believe that you will reap a sixtyfold harvest when you sow to a minister of God (Matthew 10:41). When you do something for your pastor, and he or she says, “God bless you,” your seed will return at least a sixtyfold harvest, just as we see in 1 Kings 17:10- 16. The widow of Zarephath and her son had given up on life before she honoured Elijah with their last meal. She experienced a massive turnaround, and throughout the grievous famine, her jar of flour never ran out, and her jug of oil never became empty (1 Kings 17:16). Furthermore, apart from material blessings, when her son died, God brought him back to life (1 Kings 17:17-24).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some Bible scholars also believe that giving to the high priest will yield a hundredfold harvest. Hebrews 5:1-4 tells us that the high priest is someone God has chosen to represent men before Him. The highest spiritual authority God has ordained over you is a representative of Jesus Christ, our Great High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16), and if you give to such a fellow, you can rest assured that God will bless you a hundredfold and more in return.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where and how you sow your seeds play a significant role in determining the level of harvests you can get from God. You should, however, ensure your sowing is done out of love to honour God and not just because you want a harvest from Him. God wants you to give cheerfully and sacrificially (2 Corinthians 9:7, Mark 12:41-44), and He judges the intent of your heart (1 Samuel 16:7). I pray that you will experience bountiful blessings as you honour Him with your giving, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

He wasn’t pleasing men or trying to get their approval; he wanted to please the God of wonders. Today, people are still talking about Solomon because of the great things that God did in his life. God prospered him physically – throughout his life, there was no war because God silenced all his enemies (1 Kings 5:4). God also prospered him mentally and materially – his wisdom and riches were so great that God said that no other king will ever be like him. If you read 1 Kings 3:15- 28, you will see an example of how God blessed Solomon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you please God in your sowing, He will give you multiple wonders so that long after you are gone, your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren will still be reaping from the harvest. I pray that God will open the eyes of your understanding to know that harvest is a wonder; all you need to do is sow in such a manner that pleases God and leave the rest to Him. Very soon, the world will come to you and ask why you are so successful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a person’s ways please the Lord, He summons forces on earth, in heaven, and underneath the earth to come to that fellow’s aid. As we read in today's memory verse, even those who do not like the fellow will have no choice but to bless him or her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Isaac asked Esau to prepare him venison so that he could eat and bless him before his death, Jacob brought a delicious meal to him, and Isaac began to rain blessings on him because he enjoyed the food so much. Isaac was so pleased that he blessed Jacob with the dew of heaven, the fatness of the earth, plenty of corn and wine, and the gifts of men (Genesis 27:28-29). If an earthly father can bless his son who pleased him with such blessings, how much more our heavenly Father who owns all silver, gold, and the cattle upon a thousand hills (Haggai 2:8, Psalm 50:10)?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When your ways please God, and He blesses you, nobody can hinder your blessings. No human being, demon, witch, or wizard can oppose you when you please God. Abraham was too blessed to be cursed or hindered by any evil power. Beloved, please God in all your ways, and His blessing will rest upon you and your household, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

I was also serving as the pastor of the RCCG parish in Ilorin then, so our living room was constantly filled with people. One afternoon, after eating, I lay on the couch in the living room to rest before returning for my evening lectures. I closed my eyes so people walking around would think that I was sleeping and not disturb me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While lying down, someone grabbed my hands and legs and bent as if to kiss me. Initially, I thought it was my wife, but then I realised that whoever could hold my hands and legs at the same time must be much taller and stronger than her. I opened my eyes immediately, and the being (I really couldn’t make out what it was) vanished. I wondered what had just happened as I felt a cold sensation run down my spine. I shook it off and went for my lectures. While I was on the campus, I started experiencing a terrible stomach ache, which led to severe stooling and vomiting. On returning home, I had to practically crawl from my car to the bathroom. Then I asked, “Lord, why is this happening to me?” and He responded, “I just wanted you to get a glimpse of the battles I fight for you that you are not aware of.” Immediately He said that the stomach ache, stooling, and vomiting stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You have no idea how much God protects you as you go about your daily activities. You may think that you go and come safely because you are very careful or because you are a good driver, but believe me, your carefulness or driving skills cannot get you out of an accident that the devil has planned; only God can guarantee your safety. If you think that you are surrounded by security personnel, what will happen if they face a terror group with more sophisticated weapons than them? This is why Psalm 127:1 says that the watchman watches in vain if the Lord is not watching over the city.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, some people have plied the same routes you ply and gotten kidnapped or killed.

      "<p>God created the heavens and the earth in the beginning (Genesis 1:1-3). Today’s memory verse also says that He made all things for His pleasure. Thus, He can control all things, and this is why the wind and the sea obeyed Him (Mark 4:35-41).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You were made for God’s pleasure, but He cannot get any pleasure when your body is sick. In Mark 3:1-5, Jesus saw a man with a withered hand in the temple and must have thought to Himself, “Hand, I didn’t make you to be withered; I made you for clapping.” The man with the withered hand didn’t pray or ask for healing; the Lord healed the hand because it wasn’t giving Him pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was once an elderly man who was driving his Ford car when it suddenly broke down by the roadside. As he stood by the car looking confused, a rich man stopped right next to him and asked if he could help. The rich man got out of his car, opened the trunk of the faulty car, touched a few things, and attempted to start the car. Immediately, the car started. Amazed, the old man turned to the rich man and asked, “Why did you stop to help me?” The rich man replied, “My name is Henry Ford. I made that car to run, not to stop by the wayside.” Beloved, the One who made you is passing by now, and He will deal with everything in your life that is not giving Him glory, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When something is not as God created it to be, it doesn’t give Him pleasure. If there is any part of your life that is not revealing God’s purpose, rather than complain, begin to speak God’s counsel over it. God does all things after the counsel of His will, and when you stand on His will concerning anything, that thing must align to give Him pleasure (Ephesians 1:11).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, a blind man was brought to Jesus. Jesus led him out of the town, spat in his eyes, and put His hands on him. When He asked the blind man if he saw anything, the man replied, “I see men as trees walking.” Even though he could now see, his eyes were not working optimally. Jesus didn’t leave him to ‘manage’ the eyes; He laid His hands on him again, and he saw clearly. God wants every aspect of your life to perform optimally; nothing less than this gives Him pleasure.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I discussed how every part of your life was created to give God pleasure. Today, I want to show you that you were also created to give God glory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In John 9:1-7, the disciples asked Jesus about what was responsible for a blind man’s situation, and He replied that it was not a question of sin but that God’s glory might be revealed. The Lord spat on the ground, made some mud, put it on the blind man’s eyes, and asked him to go and wash. The blind man came back seeing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Glory belongs to God; He is the Father of glory (Ephesians 1:17). God is very jealous of His glory (Isaiah 42:8), and everything you do must give Him glory. If you try to hinder God from getting glory, He will only use you to get even more glory, as He did with Pharaoh. Even today, God is getting glory from the destruction of Pharaoh and his army because he tried to hinder the Israelites from worshipping and giving God glory (Exodus 15:1-4). Those who try to take God’s glory will bring God’s judgment upon themselves if they don’t repent. When Nebuchadnezzar’s heart was lifted because of his accomplishments, God made him roam the forest for seven years like a wild beast (Daniel 4:28-33). After eating grass like an animal, his understanding returned to him, and he gave God the glory He deserved (Daniel 4:34). It took a terrible experience for Nebuchadnezzar to give all the glory to God – do not be like Him. Always give God the glory that is due to His name. Herod also learnt to give God the glory the hard way. However, unlike Nebuchadnezzar who got a second chance, he was eaten up by worms until he died because he didn’t give God the glory (Acts 12:20-23).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a terrible and fearful thing to fall into the hands of our God, who doesn’t share His glory. When God does something for you, don’t act like you did it all by yourself; acknowledge Him and give Him the glory. Some men of God have allowed the power God gave them to deceive them into thinking they are very important. Stop stealing God’s show because you are absolutely nothing without Him. When God does anything through you, He does it for His name's sake. Don’t ever forget that you are what you are by the grace of God. God deserves all the glory, and He must have it all.</p>",

      "<p>In today’s Bible reading, Ezekiel found himself in a valley that was full of dry bones. When God asked him, “Can these bones live?” The prophet, considering the seemingly impossible situation before him, answered, “Lord, only You can tell.” In other words, he was saying, “This is beyond my faith.” God asked him to prophesy, and as he did, the dry bones came back to life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most ministers of God know that He can do all things. However, sometimes, the faith of even the greatest ministers can be terribly shaken. Sometimes, God will ask me to do something, and despite my faith in Him, I will say, “Daddy, this is beyond my faith.” He will ask me to prophesy all the same, and I will just obey and leave the fulfilment to Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you hear a minister of God prophesy, and it is beyond your faith, please don’t speak against the prophecy. Even if you don’t believe the prophecy, control your mouth not to speak against it because the consequences may be severe. In 2 Kings 7:19-20, a top government official said it was impossible for Elisha’s prophecy to be fulfilled; he saw the prophecy come to pass, but he died before he could partake of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Mark 9:14-27, Jesus’ disciples were unable to deliver a demon-possessed boy, and his father had lost hope. When Jesus arrived at the scene, the boy’s father’s request for compassion was filled with doubt. I know this because Jesus said, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.” Instead of sinking further in unbelief, the man cried out, “Lord, I believe; help my unbelief,” and he received his miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When situations are beyond your faith, cry out to God for help to believe. He can increase your faith to help you cooperate with Him to birth the impossible. Don’t hinder your miracle because of unbelief. God wants you to be willing to do whatever He demands, like the servants at the wedding in Cana (John 2:5-8).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when God brings situations that are beyond your faith your way, He wants to glorify Himself. At such times, it is not about what your faith can do but what God can do with your obedience and whatever measure of faith you have.</p>",

You are not just touching His body and blood, you are ingesting Him, and you can boldly say to anyone, “Greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was an interpreter for my Father in the Lord, I usually looked forward to Holy Communion services. Then, we partook of the Holy Communion once every year, and I was always excited because I knew that my spiritual battery would be recharged. Papa would be preaching, and I would be interpreting, thinking to myself, “Papa, please hurry up so we can get to the Communion.” By the time we finally got around to drinking the wine, I usually had to control myself from dropping the cup because I would be shaking from head to toe. I cherish partaking of the Communion so much because I always experience a new infilling of the Holy Spirit every time I drink the wine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Holy Communion is not an ordinary meal; the moment God’s minister blesses the bread and the wine, using the words of Jesus Christ in 1 Corinthians 11:24-26, they become sacred. The wine in the Communion represents the blood of Jesus, and this blood cleanses from all sin. The blood also causes every evil to pass over us as it did with the Israelites on the night the destroyer killed all the firstborns in Egypt (Exodus 12:21-30). This means that the blood of Jesus protects us and grants us victory over the enemy (Revelation 12:11). This is why those who drink it unworthily (in sin) fall sick and die (1 Corinthians 11:27-30). Those who drink it worthily experience a resurrection power from within, producing healing, deliverance, intimacy with God, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you take the Holy Communion, you have come to dine at the table of the King of kings, and it is important that you do not have anything that will mark you as an enemy of the King as you approach His table. Ensure that you examine yourself and get rid of anything that would expose you to the wrath of the King. Get rid of sin, doubt, and everything that would not allow the power in Christ’s body and blood to manifest in your life.</p>",

When he got married, and his wife became pregnant and was about to deliver, he said the same prayers, but the baby did not come out. After his wife had been in labour for three days, he fell on his face and said, “God, just have mercy on me.” When he went back to see his wife, their baby had been delivered safely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is rich in mercy (Ephesians 2:4); His mercy is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him (Psalm 103:17). In Mark 1:40-42, a leper came to Jesus and said, “I know you can heal me if you are willing.” Jesus, moved with compassion, said, “I will,” and He did.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when your prayers don’t seem to be answered, just ask God for mercy; He hardly ignores such a plea. In today’s Bible reading, Jesus told the story of two fellows who went to the temple to pray. One of them, a Pharisee, told God about all his good deeds; the other, a publican, bowed his head and said, “God be merciful to me, a sinner.” The man who cried for mercy was the one who returned home justified. When you ask for mercy, you acknowledge your helplessness before God, and He will respond to you with help. Bartimaeus’ cry for mercy reached Jesus’ ears, and he got his miracle. He didn’t only receive his sight; Jesus made him whole (Mark 10:46-52). The woman from Tyre and Sidon cried for mercy on behalf of her demon-possessed daughter, and Jesus helped her (Matthew 15:21-28). Those who ask God for mercy never leave empty-handed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You need God’s mercy when things are good and when they are not so good. You need mercy when you are in need and when you are satisfied. When in need, God’s mercy will bring you answers to problems, and in good times, His mercy will preserve your blessings. The cry for mercy shouldn’t only be on the lips of those who are in trouble and need urgent help; even those who live in abundance and believe they don’t have problems must ask for mercy so nothing will tamper with their blessings.</p>",

God does different kinds of miracles, but today, I will focus on His creative miracles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God performs creative miracles when people have concluded that a terrible situation is beyond remedy – nothing is impossible for Him. In today’s Bible reading, Jesus and His disciples passed by a man who had been born blind, and the disciples asked Jesus about whose sin was responsible for the man’s predicament. Jesus told them that it wasn’t a question of sin but that the man’s condition was intended to bring God glory. Jesus spat on the ground, made some mud, and put it on the blind man’s eyes. He then told the man to go and wash, and after he washed off the mud, he came back seeing. That is what I call a creative miracle – a miracle involving the act of creation. If the doctors have said that you have an irreversible medical condition, God will recreate the part of your body that is affected, in Jesus’ name. This was what God did in 2 Kings 5:1-14 when He healed Naaman’s leprosy and made his flesh become like that of a newborn baby.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen numerous cases of women who didn’t have a womb but who gave birth to babies. Some of them had multiple births more than once. God is able to handle genetic issues, change blood groups, replace missing body parts, and even increase or reduce people’s weights and heights. A man who had childlike faith once sat listening to me. As miracles happened around the altar, he struggled to see all that was happening because his sight was blocked by people who were taller than him. He then said in his heart, “If only I was taller.” God heard him and told me that there was someone in the congregation who wished he was taller. He told me to tell the person to look down, and if he finds that his trousers have become shorter, he should know that there is nothing wrong with them because he is the one who has grown taller. When it was time for testimonies, he came forward with his wife, who testified that her husband had indeed grown taller. How do you explain that? God’s creative power was at work to make the impossible possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I pray that God will give you creative miracles, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

He wants you to cast all your cares on Him because He cares for you (1 Peter 5:7). He owns you, so He will take care of you. The question now is, does Jesus really own you? Does He own the thoughts of your heart, the direction and focus of your eyes, and your resources? If He truly owns you, then you have nothing to worry about. However, if there are parts of your life that you haven’t surrendered totally to Him, then there’s cause for worry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My Father in the Lord taught me that it is what your father has that he will take care of you with. If God is your Father and owner, then He will take care of you with pleasures forevermore because they are abundant at His right hand (Psalm 16:11). However, if the devil owns you and you do his will, he will take care of you with lies and torment because that is his speciality. When the devil owns a fellow, that fellow will always be I need, because true satisfaction can only be found in God. The devil has nothing good to offer his own. While he has slaves, God has sons, and as a son of the Most High, all things are yours (1 Corinthians 3:21). God is extending a great invitation to you today, just like the one Jesus extended to the crowd on the great day of the feast in today’s Bible reading. He is calling you to come and drink and to come and buy wine without money and without price. He is calling you to a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost (Romans 14:17).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>I call heaven and earth to record this day…that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: Deuteronomy 30:19 &nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ball is in your court.

In John 6:5-13, Jesus fed 5,000 men, not counting women and children, with a boy’s lunch. To show that He truly cared, He multiplied the lunch until everybody was fed and there were twelve baskets of leftovers. These and many more stories show that Jesus truly cares.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus also cares about us, not just our needs. He knows how fragile our human bodies are, and He wants us to be in good shape to do what He has called us to do. Years ago, there was a day I attended to people from 8:00 am until 6:00pm when I managed to eat a little before attending our Bible study service. When I returned to my office, people were already waiting to see me. I kept praying for people until 10:30pm, and I was told there were ten more people waiting. By that time, my body was aching, and I was very tired. I asked God for what to do, and He said, “You don’t need to stand to pray for them. Sit down, touch their head, and let them go. They will receive their miracle.” I was surprised, and I said, “God, you mean I can talk to You, the Almighty, sitting down?” He replied that He has walked on the earth as a human, and He knows what it means to be tired.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus knows our weak frame and cares deeply about us (Psalm 103:14). He is our High Priest who is touched with the feelings of our infirmities because He faced the same issues we now face (Hebrews 4:15). In today’s Bible reading, we see how God cared for His prophet throughout the famine; he wasn’t stranded at any point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, put all your trust in God. He truly cares for you, and He will never leave you stranded.</p>",

      "<p>In Exodus 14:13-30, Pharaoh’s army pursued the Israelites as they camped before the Red Sea. The Israelites knew that unless something happened, they would either all be dead or be driven back into bondage. Moses, their leader, cried to God, and He delivered them with His mighty hand. In Mark 5:1-15, the man who was possessed by a legion of demons was set free with just one word from the Great Deliverer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A woman once had a strange problem; anytime an electric appliance was switched on around her, instead of the appliance working, the electric current would flow through her. For example, if a fan was turned on, instead of the fan rotating, the woman would start rotating. If a fridge was switched on, instead of the things in it to get cold, the woman would start getting cold, and if an electric iron was switched on, she would start getting hot. Consequently, they dared not use any electrical appliance in her house, and as such, the house was in darkness. When I sent for her, I was told that she couldn’t travel in a vehicle because one day, people tried to take her to the hospital in a pick-up van, and as the driver switched on the engine, the current flowed from the engine to the woman, picked her up, and threw her out of the vehicle. Since she couldn’t travel in a vehicle, I had to go to her house, and I told her that all she needed was to give her life to Jesus because He would deliver her from the power of darkness. She gave her life to Jesus, we prayed a simple prayer, and she was delivered immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus died and rose again to save man from satan’s grip (1 John 3:8). It doesn’t matter if many forces of darkness are troubling you; if you call on Him, He will set you free. The man with the unclean spirit in the synagogue had one demon (Mark 1:23-26), Mary Magdalene had seven (Mark 16:9), and the madman of Gadara had a legion (Mark 5:1-15), and Jesus delivered all of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I declare your deliverance from the forces of darkness that might be tormenting you or anything that concerns you, in Jesus’ name.

In today’s Bible reading, a woman came to Jesus, asking Him to heal her daughter. Jesus initially refused to answer her, then later on, told her ‘no’. She, however, persisted, and He eventually turned His ‘No’ into a ‘Yes’.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During a church programme, God’s word came that someone who was applying for a US visa had just received it. A young lady, who had an interview at the US embassy the following Monday, was so excited because she believed the prophecy was for her. Her visa application was, however, declined. Surprised, she told the visa officer, “But my daddy said the visa has been granted.” The officer looked at her and said, “Who is your daddy?” She replied, “My daddy is Pastor Adeboye.” The officer laughed, “I thought you were going to say the president or governor, but a pastor? Please leave.” As she turned to leave, the visa officer said, “Wait. Because you made me laugh, I’ll give you the visa.” It wasn’t laughter that turned the situation around; it was because there is a God who can change a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, God changes the ‘No’ of His children’s enemies to a ‘Yes’. Pharaoh kept saying ‘No’ to Moses’ demands to let God’s people go, but God arose in His mighty power to change that ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’. In one night, He dealt with all the firstborns in Egypt because Pharaoh refused to allow His firstborn, Israel, to serve Him (Exodus 4:22-23). I pray that every ‘No’ from a boss or someone in authority who has prevented you from making progress in life will be turned into a ‘Yes’ now, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have faith in God and keep trusting Him. Like the woman who persistently asked Jesus for healing for her daughter and got it eventually, your persistent faith will open doors that have remained shut against you. Moses kept going to Pharaoh until God forced him to change his ‘No’ into a ‘Yes’.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as you keep trusting in God, I decree that every door that has remained shut and has prevented you from fulfilling your destiny will be opened now. Every ‘No’ that is not in line with God’s will is turning into a ‘Yes’ for you, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will explore how God can change a ‘Not yet’ to ‘Now’. In today’s Bible reading, Jesus went to a wedding in Cana, and His mother told Him, “Son, they are out of wine,” implying that He should remedy the situation. He initially said, “My time is not yet,” but before long, what was ‘Not yet’ became ‘Now’.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was once in the USA for ministrations, and throughout my stay, a brother volunteered to drive me. I was impressed by his humility and kindness, and when I was leaving the country, I gave him a gift to give to his children. He didn’t tell me that he had been married for 19 years with no children. Not long after that, he came to our convention with his wife and child to testify of how God turned a ‘Not yet’ of 19 years into a ‘Yes’. He said that immediately I gave him the gift, he sealed it with faith and told his wife, “Daddy gave us a gift for the children; we will keep it for them.” God is still in the business of turning ‘Not yet’ to ‘Right now’, and your case will not be different, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, a young graduate was searching for a job. He had sent countless applications but was unable to land one. Finally, he made up his mind, saying, “I will be at the Holy Ghost Service. When I get there, I’m going to wrestle with God until I get my result. My time must come NOW.” Because he had no money, he walked 46 kilometres from Lagos all the way to Redemption City. He arrived just as I was about to begin my ministration. After a while, I noticed a little disturbance in the congregation; the young man had fainted because he was very tired, and the people around him were trying to revive him. I said, “What’s wrong? Bring him.” When he revived, he told his story, and when the congregation heard that he walked 46 kilometres to get a ‘Now’ answer from God, he got six job offers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t postpone what God can do for you now until tomorrow because of a lack of faith or disobedience. When Jesus said His time had not yet come, to change that narrative to ‘Now’, Mary told the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” Just as persistent faith in God will turn a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’, total obedience to His instructions will change a ‘Not yet’ to ‘Right now’. Take a bold step inspired by God and you will see His ‘Not yet’ becoming ‘Now’.</p>",

However, God intervened, and in a short time, He provided her with so much money that she became debt-free and had enough to live on for her lifetime. In John 6:5-13, He fed 5,000 people with a little boy’s lunch. Afterwards, there were 12 baskets of leftovers. God fed the multitude, and the leftovers were more than what He started with.

I picked it up, and the caller said, “Biyi?” I said, “There is no Biyi here.” When he asked who I was, I answered, “My name is Adeboye.” He asked, “Which Adeboye?” and I said, “Pastor Adeboye of RCCG.” He began to scream, and he eventually came over with his brother. When they were leaving, they gave me £50. After they left, I told God that if I knew how easily He could give me £50, I would have asked for £100. Almost ten minutes after saying that, the doorbell rang. However, before I could get to the door, the person left. Underneath the door, I saw an envelope containing another £50 from a rich miser that I had known for a long time. Again, I asked for another £50, and soon after, I miraculously got it. I became afraid and said, “Lord, I am joking. I am already satisfied with the first £50.” God embarrassed me with much more than I needed because He owns everything.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there is no limit to what God can do for His children.

This is why believers should not delay getting married once they are mature enough, have a stable source of income, and God has shown them the right partners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marriage, however, isn’t an achievement in itself; a man and his wife are to help each other achieve their God-given goals. Believers should not try to achieve everything before getting married; whoever they marry is to help them fulfil their purpose and aspirations. Some of the things people struggle to achieve will become easier when their helpers join them (Deuteronomy 32:30).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The earlier people marry and start having children, the quicker they can finish raising them and focus on God’s work. However, this exempts those whom God told specifically not to get married. I thank God I married early and had children early too. Imagine if I had my first child at age 40; I might have been unable to focus on God’s work as I should, and my wife might have been unavailable to help me. Once I was done raising all my children, I might not have had the same strength I had to do God’s work in the early days of my ministry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people delay getting married until they realise that time is running out fast. Consequently, they hurriedly find someone to marry. Marriage is not an institution to rush into; there is a need to pray and be sure of God’s will concerning it. When people are in a hurry to get married, everything will look like a sign of God’s will, and they may end up marrying the wrong partners. Marrying the wrong person is like driving with someone who isn’t going in your direction. There will always be disagreements, confusion, and stress because both parties are going in opposite directions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lamentations 3:27 says that it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth. In the context of marriage, ‘yoke’ is not a bad thing because marriage means being yoked together with the person that God has ordained to help you. In youth, people have enough strength to conquer mountains and achieve profound things with their spouses. It is unwise to wait for the perfect conditions before getting married because they will never come (Ecclesiastes 11:4). Those who keep waiting to have everything before they marry might end up wasting precious time chasing the wrong things.</p>",

If there are any demonic forces interfering with your life, they will be put to shame, in Jesus’ name. I used to say that the Lord of hosts never loses a battle, but recently, He corrected me and said, “Son, I can choose to lose a battle to win a war. I can never lose a war.” Sometimes, the Lord of hosts, in His divine wisdom, can choose to lose a battle because there is a greater war to win. For example, He allowed the devil to touch Job’s possessions and health because He wanted to showcase the excellency of His power. In another example, Pharaoh’s magicians did the same things Moses and Aaron did when they first confronted Pharaoh. However, it got to a point where they were terrified and declared, “This is the finger of God…” (Exodus 8:19). God permitted Pharaoh to remain stubborn so that He could reveal His mighty hand (Romans 9:17).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Stephen was being stoned, Saul watched, and the devil rejoiced. The devil must have thought that he had won when he eliminated Stephen, not knowing that the agent he used to oversee the task would later become a major general in God’s army. God had a bigger picture; He planned to use Saul to wreak great havoc on the kingdom of hell, and He succeeded. The Lord of hosts wins every war. No matter how terrible things get, when He steps on the scene, everything will align in favour of His beloved children. No wonder Paul said, “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God and who are the called according to His purpose” (Romans 8:28).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the Lord of hosts isn’t just the mighty Man in battle; He is also the only wise God (1 Timothy 1:17). He can rearrange things to suit His purpose – even the worst of situations. Trust Him to use whatever unpleasant situation that exists in your life for your good and for His glory.</p>",

He said that he used to be, and when the pastor asked why he stopped following God, he shared his story. The pastor immediately showed him through the Scriptures that he could be forgiven and restored. Then, he prayed with him, and the young evangelist was restored – joy flooded his heart. The next morning, the pastor didn’t see the young evangelist. When he asked the nurses about him, they told him that he had joyfully passed on. God mercifully allowed the young man to return from his vomit before taking him home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is willing to restore backsliders when they return to Him sincerely; He is not interested in their death or destruction. In Jeremiah 3:13-14, He pleaded with backsliders to acknowledge their iniquity and turn to Him. God will always receive and restore people with humble and contrite hearts. The prodigal son was a backslider who received his Father’s mercy and was fully restored. Despite all he did, when he repented and took the right step to return to his father, he was received joyfully. God delights in welcoming lost sons home. If you are backslidden, don’t allow Satan to lie to you that God can never forgive you. He is waiting for you with wide open arms; return to Him now.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I established that God considers sinners and backsliders as dogs (Matthew 15:21-28, 2 Peter 2:22), and today, I will conclude the discussion on God’s willingness to change them to children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before I became born again, and while I was still single, I had so many girlfriends. Years later, after I had gotten married and given my life to Christ, I became a lecturer at the University of Ilorin. After a while, one of my former girlfriends, who had also gotten married, relocated to Ilorin with her husband. She had a child who was born lame, and somebody told her that there was a pastor who could pray for her child, and the child would begin to walk. When she came to the church, she asked to see the pastor. She was ushered into my office, and when she opened the door and saw me, we greeted ourselves as old flames would. Finally, she said, “I want to see the pastor.” I said, “Yes, how can I help you?” She replied, “I said I want to see the pastor.” I said, “I am the pastor.” She responded, “You? You will pray, and God will answer?” We prayed, and the child began to walk.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible says that if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature (2 Corinthians 5:17). The greatest miracle is the salvation of souls. If you are not yet born again, no matter how grave your sins are, God can save you too as He saved me. Before Saul encountered Jesus, he was a persecutor of Christians. However, after his encounter, he became a great asset to the Kingdom (1 Timothy 1:12-14). God converted cities through him, and a whole continent heard of Jesus through his ministry (Acts 19:26). There is no limit to what God can do in you, with you, and through you because when He transforms a man, He does it completely. As a son, you will have access to divine privileges. You will have the right to call God your Father, and you will partake of His inheritance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul understood what it meant to be a new creature, and as God’s child, he exercised his divine rights and authority. From a former dog, special miracles happened, and many people became transformed. If you are not yet born again, God wants to give you a new identity and make you His beloved child. Surrender to Him now and watch Him make your life a wonder to many (Psalm 71:7).</p>",

      "<p>When God’s seed is in you, sin becomes irritating to you. No matter how hungry a cat is, it will not eat faeces. Today’s Bible reading says that if you are born of God, you cannot sin because God’s seed is in you. As God’s child, no matter the temptation you face, His seed in you will help you overcome it. People who claim to be born again and are still enjoying sin are not truly saved. Sin separates people from God and makes them satan’s lawful captives (2 Timothy 2:26). If you are living in sin, you should cry to God for His salvation that takes away the seed of sin and replaces it with His seed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God translates believers from the kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of His light (Colossians 1:13) and gives them a new identity and DNA. Just as a mango seed can never produce an apple, Christians don’t have the capacity to produce sin because God’s seed is in them. However, if a believer refuses to nurture and grow this seed, he or she will be overpowered by sin. Abiding in God’s word is one way to allow the seed of God within you to bloom and cause you to bear the fruits of righteousness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s memory verse says that you have been born again of incorruptible seed – the word of God, which lives and abides forever. His word is sharper than any two-edged sword and can discern the intents of our hearts long before they become actions (Hebrews 4:12). Christians who allow God’s word to dwell richly in them (Colossians 3:16) will stand strong against temptations and sin. Sin is an operation of darkness, but God’s word brings light and understanding (Psalm 119:130). Knowing God’s word will make you wise and alert; you will be able to foresee the dangers in certain situations and hide yourself (Proverbs 22:3). Joseph discerned the evil in Potiphar’s wife’s request and ran away (Genesis 39:12). Samson, on the other hand, couldn’t discern the evil in Delilah’s request until it was too late (Judges 16:1- 21). If you want to be a great instrument in God’s hands, you must take God’s word seriously. Anything that keeps you from God’s word wants to destroy your soul. God’s seed in you will be preserved from the corruption of sin when you make His word your topmost priority.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t allow yourself to become Satan’s lawful captive.</p>",

      "<p>We live in a world of constants and variables. For example, the heights and weights of humans are variables as they differ between individuals. Wealth is also a variable because some people are rich while some are poor. Even among the rich, wealth remains a variable because a fellow can have riches today, and it could all be gone tomorrow (Proverbs 23:5). In contrast, constants represent things that never change. For instance, men do not get pregnant and give birth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In life also, we have variable constants; these are things that are supposed to be constant but can be subject to changes. For example, adults are supposed to have 32 teeth, but if you check, you may find that some adults have less than 32 teeth. Ecclesiastes 12:3 says that the grinders become few with age, which is the Bible’s wonderful way of saying that you may lose some of your teeth as you grow older. Furthermore, we have absolute constants. For example, a day following a night is a constant. It has been happening since the world began, and it will continue to happen until God says otherwise. Psalm 30:5 says that weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. It is certain that a day will follow a night; therefore, before sunrise tomorrow, all your sorrows will be gone, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our God is an absolute constant. In today’s memory verse, He said, “…I am the Lord, I change not…” He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). Who He was is who He is – He never changes. That is why He introduced Himself to Moses as I AM, not ‘I WAS,’ nor ‘I WILL BE’. If He gave someone a miracle yesterday, you can rest assured that He can give you the same today. The God who healed the sick and made the lame walk is still the same. Do you have a case that looks impossible? Our God is Almighty, and there is nothing impossible with Him (Luke 1:37). Pray and search through the Scriptures for God’s word to you concerning the situation, for the things that were written in the Bible were written for your learning, that you might have hope through patience and the comfort of the Scriptures (Romans 15:4).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God never changes; His word is constant (Isaiah 40:8). Let your heart be filled with hope because His word never fails. Hold on to His word, and very soon, your hope will be turned into testimonies.</p>",

      "<p>In a world of constantly changing laws and policies, I God can be trusted to remain an absolute constant, as I discussed yesterday. His words, principles, and actions are consistent, and they can never change. When politicians campaign for political offices, they make numerous promises, some of which they often fail to fulfil. God is never like that; His promises are constant, and His deeds can be absolutely trusted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many things are constant about God; I will discuss one today – His word – and three more tomorrow. God’s word existed before the world began, and it will remain long after the earth passes away (John 1:1). If He makes you a promise and you play your part as He requires, no matter how long it takes, He will surely fulfil it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One day, I was praying, and God said, “Son, presidents will come to the camp to worship.” At that time, it seemed impossible, but Daddy said it, and as far as I was concerned, it was settled already. Therefore, with faith, we built a presidential lodge immediately, and it was the biggest building in the camp (now Redemption City) back then. Three years passed, and when no president came, some senior pastors said to me, “Daddy, you are our president. Why don’t you move into the presidential lodge?” They didn’t fully understand why we built the presidential lodge, and they felt that I wanted to live in a big house but didn’t know how to tell them. I told them, “No! That’s not my house. It’s for presidents; they will come.” Of course, presidents have come and are still coming. No matter how long it takes, God’s word and promises will come to pass.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to today’s memory verse, the potency of God’s word is constant; no word that comes out of His mouth will return to Him void. This means that you can claim whatever you see in the Scriptures, and you will receive it if you believe. For example, Deuteronomy 28:13 says that you shall be the head and not the tail. If you believe this, then you will indeed be the head. 1 Peter 2:24 says that you have been healed by His stripes. If you believe this, then sickness has no place in your body.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Situations may vary, but God’s word is constant. No matter how bad a situation appears to be, God can turn it around for good because His word is living and powerful, and that will never change.</p>",

In mathematics, constants are numbers or quantities that remain at a fixed value throughout a given discussion, while variables are unstable and are dependent on other factors. God is the only consistent constant throughout eternity, and with Him, there is no variableness or shadow of turning (James 1:17).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Having discussed His word as one of His constant qualities yesterday, I will identify and explore three more absolute constants about Him, and these are: His principles, His love, and His mercy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s principles are His ways of doing things, and they are constant. They are His standards, and they can never change. One of God’s principles for marriage is that it is honourable unto all, and the bed should be undefiled before marriage (Hebrews 13:4). If He says that people should get married before they have sex, that principle remains, it will not change because the world has changed or because government laws have changed to accommodate immorality. God’s principles remain firm and constant, now and always. Another principle of marriage is that it is between a man and a woman, and from the first couple and throughout the Bible, we see God maintain this standard. God’s principle is that a man should leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife (Genesis 2:24). Likewise, God’s principle of sowing and reaping remains constant. Anyone who applies this principle will reap its harvest. God has principles for every aspect of life, and anyone who wants to enjoy His full blessings must learn to live by His principles. His foundation is sure, but you must depart from iniquity to partake of His blessings (2 Timothy 2:19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s mercy and steadfast love are constant. For example, because of His constant love and mercy towards man, He does not want anyone to perish (1 Timothy 2:4). God’s love for you is constant (1 Corinthians 13:8). His steadfast love never ceases, and His mercies never come to an end – they are new every morning (Lamentations 3:22-23). If you experienced an overload of mercy yesterday, expect a fresh dose today because God gives new mercies every morning – He daily loads His beloved with benefits (Psalm 68:19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God is an absolute constant and you can totally rely on Him. Trust Him with all your heart, and He will be an anchor for your soul in the midst of life’s uncertainties (Hebrews 6:19).</p>",

He is the God of all flesh, and nothing is too hard for Him (Jeremiah 32:27). Some diseases are termed incurable, but for God, no disease is incurable. Even if a damaged body part is deemed irreparable, He can replace it. While earthly physicians refer cases to each other when they cannot handle them, the Great Physician never refers a case – He is a specialist in all fields of medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, a wealthy chief, who became paralysed from the waist downwards, was taken to the best hospital in London. After trying their best and he didn’t get better, the doctors gave up. To prove the hopelessness of his case, the head surgeon drove a long pin through the chief’s thigh, and when the latter felt no pain, he told him, “Go home, stop wasting your money, you will never walk again.” The chief was taken back home, and a young girl, who is a member of RCCG, witnessed to him and said, “If you can get to my G.O., you will walk again.” The chief was brought to Redemption City, and because he had a big stature, six hefty men had to carry him into my living room. I told him my God can change the doctors’ report and that if he surrendered his life to Jesus, things would change. He surrendered his life to Jesus, we prayed, and he walked back to his car! What renowned medical specialists termed impossible took God only a few seconds to do!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen God turn hopeless cases into great testimonies.

He turned around the 12-year-old case of the woman with the issue of blood in a second (Luke 8:44). Lazarus’ four-day-old dead body didn’t take him hours to resurrect (John 11:43- 44). The man at the pool of Bethesda with the 38-year-old infirmity received instant healing (John 5:1-9). If you have any sicknesses or diseases in your body, I pray that the Great Physician will step in and turn things around immediately, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

In Psalm 107:20, the Bible says that He sent His word to deliver the Israelites from their troubles. It doesn’t matter how big the opposition you are facing is, the One who is mighty in battle will give you a great victory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus said in John 14:6 that He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In John 8:32, He said that you shall know the truth, and it shall make you free. If you are facing an enemy that appears to be greater than you, my advice is that you surrender your life completely to Jesus now. Once He makes you free, you are free indeed, and no one can oppress you again. In Luke 11:21-22, He said that the only way anyone can steal the goods of a strong man is if he or she is stronger. Since there is no one stronger than God, once you are surrendered to Him and have become His child, no one can take you from Him. This is why Jesus said in John 10:29:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, when Jehoshaphat was attacked on every side by the Ammonites, the Moabites, and the inhabitants of Mount Seir, he called on the One who is mighty in battle.

Nobody escaped after the Mighty Man in battle set Jehoshaphat’s enemies against one another. All Jehoshaphat and his men had to do was gather abundant spoils because the Lord made them rejoice over their enemies. I decree today that any gang or group that comes to attack you will help to utterly destroy one another; the Mighty One in battle will set your enemies against themselves, in Jesus’ name. In the name above every other name, none of your enemies will escape the sword of the Mighty One in battle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, surrender totally to Jesus today if you are yet to do so.

When it seems like there’s no way to solve a problem, He makes a way where there is no way, like He did for the Israelites in Exodus 14:21-22.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Exodus 16:11-17, when the children of Israel were on their way to the Promised Land, God rained down readymade food from heaven. Because they had never seen or tasted anything like it before, they called it ‘manna’. In Numbers 11:1-32, when they were tired of eating only manna and wanted to eat meat, Moses cried to God on their behalf, and God told him there would be meat the next day. As great as Moses’ faith was, he found it hard to believe there could be enough meat for all the Israelites within one day. By the next day, God had provided heaps of quails for them. One day, there was no meat, and the next day, there was an abundance. That is my God; He specialises in bringing something out of nothing. This is why you must never underestimate Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2 Kings 7:1-16, a city was experiencing a severe famine, and God spoke through His prophet that within 24 hours, there would be so much food that nobody would want to buy. There was a top government official who said it was impossible; he saw it come to pass, but he died before he could partake of the miracle. It doesn’t matter how hopeless a situation is; just bring God into the equation, and He will bring something out of nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A woman once asked me to pray for her child, who was dumb and had never spoken since birth. I laid my hand on the child and said, “In the name of Jesus,” and the child said, “Amen!” I had not even prayed yet, and God caused the child who had never spoken before to speak. He put a voice where there was none; I was so amazed, I almost jumped out of the window. I pray for you today; in those areas where the enemy has caused emptiness, barrenness, and stagnation, the Great I Am will cause something good and beautiful to come out of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God specialises in creating magnificent things out of dark and empty places like He did in Genesis 1:1-3. Every nothingness in your life will turn into something bright and beautiful today, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

God is King, and He is King forever.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I say that God is king, I mean that He is King over all earthly kings. No matter how powerful a king is and no matter how much he has achieved, God is greater than him. In Daniel 4:1-37, Nebuchadnezzar thought that he could take the glory that belonged to God. God made him eat grass for seven years, and when he came back to his senses, he said, “God is the Almighty.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a king in your own right, whether in your organisation, family, state, or wherever, your reign is only temporary. You should submit to the One who is King forever if you want to have a good and memorable reign. David submitted to God, and up until today, Israel still recognises him as their greatest king ever.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many years ago, I was invited to dedicate the RCCG national headquarters in a particular country, and I gave the church leaders a date in my calendar. In that country, government permits are required before hosting dedication ceremonies, so the church applied for a permit. However, a man in the government was determined to stop the dedication. He said, “I have heard about this church. You plan to convert everyone and build churches everywhere; that will not work here.” The church leaders called me to report the situation, and to be honest, I didn’t even pray about it. The day the man was to attend a meeting to conclude that the dedication wouldn’t be allowed to take place, he accidentally put both of his legs into the same trouser hole as he was dressing up. He struggled to free his legs until he fell and was rushed to the hospital. He eventually died with both of his legs still in the same trouser hole. Nobody possesses greater power than God; when He decides to do something, it is better to cooperate with Him because He cannot be stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus is King forever, and all power belongs to Him. All souls are His (Ezekiel 18:4), including yours, and He wants you to surrender what belongs to Him. You belong to the King, and it is a blessed thing to belong to Him because you will automatically have access to all that He has.</p>",

      "<p>Many believers fail to share the gospel because of fear. The key to overcoming this, however, is to ask God for boldness and wisdom for each unique occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I recall a time I flew first class because someone gifted me the ticket. I sat next to a man who I could tell was very rich from his appearance. I really wanted to tell him about Jesus, but I was afraid he wouldn’t listen because he would think that he was above such things. Therefore, I decided to go about it with wisdom. I said, “Sir, I’d love to introduce you to my Daddy.” He asked, “Who is your Daddy?” “My Daddy is a great chief. He’s into oil and gas, and He does some silver, gold, and diamonds. He also has a big farm with thousands of cattle,” I replied. Then he asked, “How come I don’t know him? What’s your father’s name?” I knew that if I said Jesus at that stage, I might lose Him, so I said, “My Father’s name is Chief Emmanuel.” That got his attention, and I was able to share the gospel with him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God called young Jeremiah to preach to the rebellious children of Israel, He instructed him not to be afraid of their faces. The same God is with you when you go out to tell others about Jesus’ love. He has given you His Spirit to teach you what to say, just as He taught me on that flight. No matter how tough-faced or uninterested people may look, don’t look at their faces; focus on the One who sent you and deliver His message to them. An adage in Yorubaland says that you shouldn’t fear the one you are delivering a message to but the one who sent you to deliver the message. Don’t allow the fear of men prevent you from preaching the gospel. Keep your eyes on God, do as He has commanded all believers (Matthew 28:18-19), and leave the conviction and conversion to Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once God is with you, nothing else matters. He’ll teach you what to say and how to say it. Preaching the gospel is not about how excellently you can speak and quote the Scriptures but the demonstration of the Spirit and of power (1 Corinthians 2:4).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, surrender your life to Jesus today if you haven’t; He is the only way to salvation. If you have surrendered your life to Him, ensure you share the gospel with others; don’t be afraid of their faces.</p>",

A mother may not be as physically strong as a father, but she has immense strength in other areas. I usually say that I am where I am today because of God's grace and my mother’s prayers. Whenever I did something that impressed her, she would say, “You will call one fellow, and 100 will answer.” What she meant was, ‘You will be very influential.’ Today, God has blessed me with great influence over many people across the world. When a mother is happy with a child, whatever she deeply desires and prays over the child will come to pass.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, Ephesians 6:2-3 instructs you to honour your father and mother (not just your father alone) so that you can enjoy tremendous blessings.

I made sure that I saw her at least once every two weeks so that she wouldn’t miss me so much. If your mother is still alive, or if you have mother figures in your life, ensure that you always honour them by being obedient and caring towards them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a mother, your role in deciding your children’s future is very important. You must ensure that they are disciplined and focused on fulfilling God’s will for their lives. Don’t pamper them; train them diligently. Don’t prioritise making money or partying over spending quality time with them. Also, be willing to make sacrifices to help them grow up in wisdom, strength, and the way of the Lord.

After a while, I noticed a side of the road that was free of traffic, and I moved my car there. Unknown to me, there was a rule that vehicles could only drive on that side of the road after 10am, and that was why it was free. Some policemen stopped my car and said, “Don’t you know that you can only pass here from 10am?” I told them I didn’t know and that I was sorry. I explained that I am a pastor, and I was hurrying to go and pray for the sick. They said, “Well, you know what to do.” I knew they were expecting a bribe, but as a child of God, I couldn’t do it. Therefore, they said, “You will wait here until 10am before we let you go.” As I waited, some street boys who were some distance away recognised me, and one of them said, “That is Daddy Adeboye. It seems the policemen are harassing him; let’s go and help him.” When the policemen saw them approaching, they left me and hurried away.

Jesus had told His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they received the Holy Ghost (Luke 24:49). The day of Pentecost and the events that followed defined Christianity forever. If only there could be a repeat of that day in churches all over the world; oh, what a revival that will be. There was a similar experience in Azusa, USA, in 1906, and up until today, people are still talking about that revival. For the next few days, I will be examining what happened on the day of Pentecost and the implications of the events of that day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One major thing you must note is that the disciples were in an upper room – they were separated from the rest of the world. While everyone around them was enjoying the Passover feast, they were in a different realm, praying, fasting, and yearning to go deeper in the Lord. If we are to experience a repeat of that day, Christians must learn to live separately from the world (2 Corinthians 6:14). You cannot be engrossed in the pursuit of material things like the rest of the world and expect the Holy Spirit to descend on you and manifest through you as He did on the day of Pentecost. You cannot expect to carry the power of the Holy Ghost when your eyes are focused on worldly things. What you behold is what you will eventually become (2 Corinthians 3:18).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You cannot love the world and claim to also love God (1 John 2:15). You cannot keep listening to worldly music and expect to be filled with the Holy Spirit. What you listen to greatly impacts your life, and faith comes by hearing God’s word (Romans 10:17).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the upper room, the disciples were not distracted by mundane things. Their eyes, representing their focus, were single, causing them to be filled with light (Matthew 6:22). Their desire was to wait for the promise of the Father, and they did this wholeheartedly. To receive and manifest the Holy Spirit’s power, you must seek God wholeheartedly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only those who seek God with all their hearts and souls find Him (Deuteronomy 4:29). Only those who separate themselves from sin and distractions will receive the Holy Spirit’s power, like on the day of Pentecost. Beloved, God wants you to be separate because you are His (2 Corinthians 6:17) and not of this world (John 15:19).</p>",

Another thing I must point out is that on the day of Pentecost, the disciples were in one accord. If we want to see the power of the Holy Spirit in action, there must be love and unity in the Body of Christ, irrespective of denominations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalm 133:1-3 says that God commands a blessing when people are united. It didn’t say that God gives a blessing; it says that He commands a blessing. In other words, He says, “Blessing, you must manifest.” When there is genuine love and unity among the members of a church or fellowship, there is absolutely no doubt that every member of that fellowship will be blessed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s power will not manifest in a divided church or family. Unity attracts God’s presence, just as sugar attracts ants. Likewise, if a church is full of strife, jealousy, and all sorts of carnal works, God’s power will be far from that church. Paul had to rebuke the Corinthian church for having factions. While some said that they were for Paul, some claimed that they were for Apollos (1 Corinthians 3:4). Paul called them carnal for their disunity. The Body of Christ is one, and if we want to experience God’s power and presence like on the day of Pentecost, we must lay aside our petty differences and focus on the One whose name we bear – Jesus Christ. We cannot attack one another and expect God to dwell among us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. </strong>Galatians 5:15<strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the Scripture above, we see that when we live in disunity, we will consume one another. Many believers have injured other members of the Body of Christ with their words and actions. We must stop this and live in love and unity so that God’s presence and power can truly be manifested among us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Loving one another and being united is a sure way of showing the world that we are truly Jesus’ disciples (John 13:35). We should not let unbelievers reject the gospel because they do not see love among us as Christians.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The body of Christ must unite. Gossiping, backbiting, and unhealthy competition among denominations must stop if we want to experience a true revival by the Holy Spirit.</p>",

Their hearts were tuned to God, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we truly want a revival in our generation, we cannot watch weak believers remain in their weak states. We must sharpen each other (Proverbs 27:17) such that the ‘weakest’ among us will be working miracles. If we’re really united, we won’t look away when we see a brother dozing when he should be praying; we will hold his hand to encourage him to pray. We will not see a sister dressing indecently and showing signs of backsliding without trying to encourage her faith. If someone’s fire seems to be dying, pray for the fellow rather than use him or her as a bad example to others to make yourself look righteous.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone in the upper room on that particular day received a touch from God because they submitted to Him and to one another – nobody felt superior. In the 70s, I knew a young man called Bro Sam. He wasn’t a member of RCCG, but he was very popular because he was heavily anointed by God. He couldn’t speak English, but he was so anointed and was well sought after. On one occasion, he was invited to preach at a college. When he got up to say that he didn’t speak English and would need an interpreter, Queen’s English began to flow from his lips. He didn’t know what he was saying, but the message kept flowing. After about one hour, people began to rush forward, weeping and crying for salvation. As soon as he left the college, he couldn’t speak English again. There were testimonies of at least three dead people that God resurrected through him. Whenever he prayed for the sick, he would describe how their sicknesses were moving out of their bodies until they were completely healed. However, pride entered his heart after a while, and whenever he was called to go for Bible study, he would say, “Who is preaching? How many dead people has he raised?” Sadly, he ended up in an asylum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if we want God’s power to rest among us, we must shun pride and submit to one another in the fear of God (Ephesians 5:21).

This means that there must be constant thanksgiving and praise to God if we want to experience a mighty move of the Holy Spirit in the body of Christ today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we meet to pray concerning our needs, God will show up. However, when we meet just to thank Him and acknowledge His greatness, He will manifest in a powerful way, and there will be a revival; miracles will become commonplace in our midst, and there will be many testimonies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I promised to visit one of the RCCG elders and told him I would spend just five minutes with him. Before I arrived, he had beautiful hymns and praise songs playing because he had observed that I am always humming songs of praise to God. I didn’t know when I spent one hour with him because I was enjoying the music. If you are God’s child and He always hears praises around you, He will definitely stay with you. God inhabits the praises of His people (Psalm 22:3); He comes wherever He is exalted and extolled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who complain and murmur cannot host God’s presence. When the Israelites murmured, it displeased God, and at some point, His fire fell among them. Unlike the tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost, this fire burnt and consumed them (Numbers 11:1). When Paul and Silas were imprisoned, instead of complaining, they started praising God. God came into the prison and caused a great earthquake such that the foundations were shaken (Acts 16:25-26). When you praise God amidst difficulties, He brings solutions that men cannot deny, giving you blessings that extend to those around you. When the prison was shaken, all the doors were opened, and everyone’s bands were loosed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Beloved, surrender your life to Jesus Christ if you haven’t done so and choose to live a life of praise. The Holy Spirit will dwell in you and manifest mightily around you. He will liberate you if you are in any form of bondage and bless you so much that the blessings will be evident in your life and in the lives of everyone connected to you.</p>",

      "<p>As I continue to discuss the significance of the events of the day of Pentecost, I want you to consider that on that day, there was a sound of a mighty rushing wind (Acts 2:1-2). In Exodus 14:21-28, when the wind blew, a way appeared where there was none before. When a revival like the day of Pentecost happens, every force that is hindering the church will be blown away by the wind, and ways will appear where there were none before.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some years ago, I was invited to preach in an orthodox church, and I preached about the three basic steps of Christianity: salvation, sanctification, and baptism in the Holy Spirit. When I finished speaking about the Holy Spirit, I was expecting some opposition, but an Archdeacon came to me and said, “Sir, thank you for explaining to us that the Holy Spirit is like wind. If the wind wants to blow past somewhere and someone is blocking the way, what will happen?” I said, “The little I know is that the person will be uprooted.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever has been standing against your progress and God’s plans for your life will be uprooted once the Holy Ghost comes. I pray that any power of darkness that might be keeping you from fulfilling God’s will and enjoying His blessings will be uprooted by the wind of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing that happens when the wind blows is that there is divine provision. When God was going to give His people meat, He sent forth a wind that brought quails from the sea, and they fell in abundance around the camp such that the people gathered them until the next day (Numbers 11:31-32). There is always more than enough where the wind of the Spirit blows.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, Job said that the Spirit of God made him, and the breath of the Almighty gave him life (Job 33:4). God’s wind gives life, and where there is life, death cannot stay. When God breathed into man in Genesis 2:7, man became a living soul; he was transformed from mere dust into a walking, talking being. You will experience transformation when the wind of God’s Spirit blows as it did over the formlessness of the earth and transformed it into a beautiful place (Genesis 1:1-3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I decree that you will receive a fresh visitation of the wind of God this season, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, as I continue my discussion on the events of the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, I want to examine the implication of the fire that appeared and sat on each of the disciples. In today’s Bible reading, we see that Elijah’s prayer that caused fire to fall from heaven was majorly filled with praises. In the atmosphere of praise, God answers prayers by fire. When the fire fell, idol worship stopped in the land. The reason the agenda of the devil appears to be thriving in certain places is that the necessary conditions for revival have not been met.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing Elijah did before the fire fell in today’s Bible reading was to repair the broken altar. When we repair our broken altars of prayer, praise, and worship, God’s fire will fall. We cannot be lukewarm and expect God to send His fire. The disciples tarried in the upper room before God’s fire fell – they were busy praying and setting the stage for His fire (Acts 2:1-2). After Elijah repaired the broken altar, he put the wood in order and prepared the sacrifice (1 Kings 18:33). We cannot be disorderly and expect God’s fire to fall.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elijah also asked the people to pour four barrels of water thrice on the sacrifice. Note that it hadn’t rained for three and a half years; therefore, pouring such an amount of water was a huge sacrifice on its own. The people poured a scarce commodity in preparation for rain. No wonder God was in a hurry to send down His fire. Wherever God sees unusual sacrifice, He sends His fire. In 2 Chronicles 5, after completing the temple, Solomon gathered all the Levites, priests, and Israelites, and they sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told or numbered for multitude. After this great sacrifice, God’s presence filled the temple such that the priests could not stand to minister. Then, as soon as Solomon finished praying, fire fell from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices (2 Chronicles 7:1). God’s fire of preservation, increase, and unusual miracles falls in atmospheres of prayer and sacrificial giving.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do you desire God’s fire? Don’t hold back in giving Him your heart, time, and resources. Give sacrificially and pray consistently; you will be visited by the fire of God’s power, provision, and glory.</p>",

I could have asked for anything that day, and He would have given me, but I asked for the power of the Holy Spirit in action among my congregation. He then told me to hold a programme which we called the Holy Ghost Service, and from that time on, we started to see great miracles that we had never seen before in RCCG.

Peter was singled out for something extraordinary.

      "<p>In 1963, while I was a teacher at Ondo Boys’ High School in South-West Nigeria, I was teaching 35 lesson periods every week. Another tutor, who had more experience and qualifications than me, was teaching just 21 lesson periods every week. He was earning four times more than I was earning and was still grumbling about the workload. I went to him and said, “Sir, you are teaching 21 lesson periods while I am teaching 35, yet you are earning four times what I am earning, and you are complaining.” He drew me close, patted me, and said, “My boy, you don’t understand. I’m being paid for what I have already done. I’m being paid for what is in my brain.” While I was labouring and earning peanuts, the other teacher wasn’t working as hard, yet he was earning more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a difference between working diligently and labouring. A manual labourer has to work very hard to get little pay. You can’t call a manager a labourer; both of them go to their workplaces in the morning, but one goes to work, and the other goes to labour. Even though a manager arrives at the office very early every day and works hard, he or she gets paid something worthwhile for his or her efforts. In Genesis 2:15, God gave Adam a garden to tend. Some Bible scholars have described the Garden of Eden to be as big as Lagos, Nigeria. To ask one man to keep a garden of that size requires a lot of work. However, Adam was working, not labouring. After he fell into sin, he began to labour (Genesis 3:17-19), such that when he worked, he sweated – it wasn’t recorded that he sweated before this time. Additionally, after labouring and sweating, the ground yielded thorns and thistles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Luke 5:5, Peter toiled all night and caught nothing – that is labouring. Even though he worked hard all night, he had nothing to show for it. However, Peter’s labouring days ended when Jesus came into his life. If you have been labouring and you want your labouring days to come to an end, rebuild your connection with God, and He will put an end to fruitless labours in your life forever.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if for whatever reason, you are experiencing fruitless labour even though you have surrendered your life to Christ and are living according to His will, I decree that the Lord will step into your situation today and put an end to labouring in your life, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

When I go for Mount Zion Hour at the RCCG Headquarters, where I have to lay hands on thousands of people, it is hard work, but I don’t mind because testimonies follow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a pastor fasts, prays, preaches, and follows up converts with all of his or her strength, yet the church does not grow, it is a terrible experience. I know this because I have experienced it. In the early days of my ministry, God promised that I would lead a mighty end-time army, but I couldn’t see the army. The church congregation would increase by two members in one week and decrease by four the next week. I organised seminars every month, and many people would be in attendance. However, after the seminars, the congregation would remain small. One day, God asked me what I wanted for my birthday. I replied that I wanted a miracle for every member of my congregation. He instructed me to organise a programme where He would be giving out the miracles. We called it the Holy Ghost Service, and that was how God turned things around for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;When God speaks concerning a matter, results that human efforts cannot produce are achieved. For example, when we needed N17,000 to roof the first auditorium in Redemption City, I had only N1,000. At the same time, one of the RCCG pastors was building an accommodation for some members of his congregation, and he needed N1,000 to roof it. He came to me to ask me for the money, and I got upset and said, “I need N17,000, and I have only N1,000, and you want to collect it? Please leave my office.” He got up to leave, but God spoke to me and told me to give him the N1,000. Reluctantly, I called him back and gave him the money. As he went away, God said, “Son, why are you grumbling? There were two problems; I solved one through you, and there’s only one left.” Before the day ended, somebody came from another state in the country and said, “I have just collected rent from my tenants, and God said I should bring everything to you.” The money was exactly N17,000!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you hear God’s voice, obey Him, and leave the rest to Him because your rest from labour and toil lies in your obedience.</p>",

      "<p>There is a difference between working under open heavens and working under closed heavens. Today’s memory verse says that when the heavens are opened over you, they will give the rain in due season; you will get a harvest from your work, and as a result, you will begin to lend to nations. When the heavens are closed, according to Deuteronomy 28:23-24, the rain that falls will be like powder, and your efforts will be useless.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The way to experience open heavens, as seen in Deuteronomy 28:1-2, is to hearken diligently unto the word of the Lord and to observe and do all that He commands. One of His commands is in Malachi 3:10:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the heavens are opened over a person, everything he or she touches will begin to prosper. When you live a holy life and do the will of God, the heavens will open over you. When Peter allowed Jesus to use his boat and then obeyed His instruction to let down his nets for a catch, his obedience led to an overflowing miracle. However, because Peter had operated under closed heavens for so long, he let down only one net. Even with that, he caught a great multitude of fishes (Luke 5:1-7); imagine what would have happened if he had let down many nets as Jesus instructed. In the name that is above every other name, I pray that you will hear God’s voice concerning your next level and obey His instructions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Prayer is another thing that causes a believer to walk under open heavens. When Jesus went to River Jordan to be baptised by John the Baptist, He did what other people didn’t do when they were being baptised: He prayed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Now when all the people were baptised, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, </strong>Luke 3:21<strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While others entered the water and came out under closed heavens, Jesus prayed as He went into the water and came out under an open heaven. Spending time in fervent prayers will give you results that others do not have because the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man has great power and produces wonderful results (James 5:16).</p>",

In the parable of the sower, four soils were identified, but only one brought forth harvests; the other three soils yielded nothing (Mark 4:3- 8). I pray for you today; you will not sow on barren soils, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A barren soil can be a person, an organisation, or even a house. Some people move into a new house, and everything that was working for them suddenly stops working. Some get into a new relationship or start a new business partnership, and everything they have built over the years crumbles. Jehoshaphat is an example of a fellow who entered into partnerships with people who were barren soils. Even though he was a righteous man, he entered into relationships with ungodly people. First, he became friends with Ahab, a sinful and wicked king, and almost lost his life in battle, but for God’s intervention (1 Kings 22:1-33). Then, as we read in today’s Bible reading, he joined himself with Ahab’s son, Ahaziah, another wicked king, and together, they made ships to go to Tarshish. The ships were destroyed, and the planned voyage failed because Jehoshaphat was partnering with someone who was a barren soil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who you partner with in life and destiny matters a lot. If you partner with a wicked man, your efforts will be wasted because God is angry with the wicked every day (Psalm 7:11). I pray for you; may you never partner with someone who is marked for destruction by heaven. May your efforts not be destroyed because of the partnerships you make, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A disobedient fellow is another dangerous person to partner with. When you partner with such a person, you are sowing on concrete ground because disobedience shuts the heavens over a person. Jonah is an example of such a fellow; he put the people on the ship he boarded to Tarshish in trouble because of his disobedience. Although they didn’t lose their lives, they lost their properties because of one disobedient passenger (Jonah 1:1-5). When you join yourself to a disobedient person, you will suffer losses.

      "<p>In Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus invites those who are burdened to come to Him so that they can find rest. However, He said that when they come, they should take up His yoke and learn of Him. It is possible for God to give you rest and bless you so much that you will say, “Lord, this is too much.” However, you must submit completely to Him and learn of Him. Joshua 1:8 says that when the book of the law does not depart from your mouth, you will have good success. Study your Bible diligently so that you can truly learn God’s ways. Once you know His ways and follow Him, you will begin to bear fruits in every area of your life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Deuteronomy 28:1-2, the Bible says that if you hearken diligently to God’s word and observe to do all He commands, blessings will pursue and overtake you. Become addicted to God’s word such that when you face any situation, the first thing that will come to your mind is, “What does the Bible say about this kind of situation?” God’s word shows us His will concerning every situation, and this should be the basis of our decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus said that when you come to learn of Him, you must note that He is meek and lowly. Those who will learn of the Master must also have meek and lowly hearts; they must be teachable. Pride makes people puffed up and become full of unnecessary weights and burdens. To learn God’s ways and enjoy good success, you must be willing to overlook many things and obey His instructions even when they seem foolish. God’s ways are different from the ways of man (Isaiah 55:8-9). When God asked Moses to stretch his rod over the Red Sea as the Egyptian army closed in on the Israelites, it looked like a foolish move, but Moses obeyed because he was a meek man (Exodus 14:16, Numbers 12:3). You cannot be set in your ways and expect God to lead you into good success. In Psalm 32:8, God promises to lead and guide His people, but in the next verse, He warns them not to be like the horse or the mule that must be led with ropes before they can obey.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God cannot lead you into good success if you are like a horse that is so fast and doesn’t wait for instructions or a mule that is so stubborn that it won’t move until it is beaten.</p>",

When I asked why, I was told that it was because the congregation was a mixture of sinners and Christians, and we didn’t want the money of sinners. I wondered, “What about those of us who are Christians? The Bible says give, and you shall be given (Luke 6:38).” Little wonder we all remained poor in those days. So, even though we were not giving offerings in church, I was giving offerings to the pastors privately. Also, in those days, when we sang choruses, we never clapped. I asked why, and I was told it was because clapping is worldly. You could never even bring up the topic of beating drums. There was no guitar, no trumpet, or any other musical instrument except the organ. Everything was solemn. However, I said, “The Bible says clap your hands all ye people (Psalm 47:1).” The first time we started clapping our hands in RCCG, the elders called a meeting to discuss it! You can imagine what happened when I introduced drums and the guitar.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, we allow the traditions of men to dictate how we should live instead of God’s word. God’s word is His perfect blueprint for every area of life, and when you follow His word, you will enjoy life abundantly. Those who fail to live according to God’s word will not experience the exceeding greatness of His power towards those who believe (Ephesians 1:19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus did not respond to the devil’s temptations according to the philosophies and traditions of men. He overcame them because He stood on what was written in God’s word (Matthew 4:1-11). He knew what was written and refused to live by anything less than that. Do you know what is written? Do you know what God has said about your situation? Are you standing on God’s word or man’s report?

It is true that the doctors can see sicknesses, but Jesus has paid the price for your health on the cross.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make up your mind to live only by God’s word, and you will experience His exceeding power in all areas of your life.</p>",

He said, “Get behind me, Satan,” and God replied, “It is not Satan, it is Me, and I am not going anywhere.” He kept trying to silence the voice that spoke to him, but the voice persisted. At last, he decided to give N500, just in case it was God. The next week, a woman came to his office and gave him N50,000. He was excited because it was a lot of money. As the woman was leaving, she turned back and said, “Sir, I’m sorry, but I have to confess this. I was actually supposed to give you N100,000, but something came up, and I had to spend N50,000 out of it.” Immediately he heard that, his excitement vanished. He realised that God wanted him to reap a harvest of N100,000, but he only sowed half of the seed that was required.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we sow something little, we will reap something little in return (2 Corinthians 9:6, Luke 6:38). The harvest of a farmer who sows on hectares of land cannot be compared to that of a farmer who sows on a small piece of land in his backyard. Wise farmers reserve their best crops for sowing because they know that the quality of the seed is a major determinant of the quality of the harvest. Only foolish fellows eat the best of their seeds. Whenever God blesses you, He puts the seed for the next season and the bread for the present season in that blessing. Always recognise your seed and sow it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seeds can be in the form of actions, service, or words. In 2 Kings 4:8-10, the great woman of Shunem sowed the seed of kindness to Elisha, and she reaped a bountiful harvest. Her decision to set aside a space for the man of God to rest whenever he passed by her town was a seed that yielded multiple harvests. First, she reaped a harvest of fruitfulness after a long period of barrenness; then, she reaped a harvest of resurrection when her son suddenly died and was resurrected. Lastly, she reaped a harvest of miraculous restoration after returning to her city following a seven-year famine to find that her land and house had been taken over (2 Kings 4:8-37, 8:1-6). I decree that all your good seeds will yield bountiful harvests, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>After reading today’s topic, you may ask, how do I become a vessel unto honour? The simple answer is that you need the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Samuel 16:1,11-13, God told Samuel, “I am sending you to Jesse’s house because I want to raise a king there.” Jesse didn’t present David initially because the entire family believed that David was not the kind of person who could become a king. However, as soon as David came, God said, “That is him.” Samuel poured oil on David’s head, and the Bible says that the Spirit of God came upon him. When the Spirit of God came upon the shepherd boy, he became who God wanted him to be – a king. God has a great plan for your life, but you need the power of the Holy Spirit over your life to fulfil it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Samuel 10:6, Samuel told Saul that the Spirit of God would come on him and he would prophesy; the Spirit of God turned an ordinary boy into a prophet. In Judges 13:1-25, an angel told a woman that she was going to give birth to a son and that he would be a judge in Israel. After that son was born, the Bible says that the Spirit of God began to move him. When the Spirit of God comes on someone, the fellow becomes who God says he or she will be. In today’s Bible reading, when the angel told Mary, “You will have a son, and He will be the son of the Highest,” she asked, “How can this be since I know no man?” The angel gave her the ultimate solution to impossible cases: The Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit came upon her, she did the impossible; she conceived God and birthed Him into the world. She became a vessel unto honour because the Holy Spirit came upon her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you struggling with sin? Do you find it difficult to spend time in God’s presence? Do you lack the fire and zeal to live a holy life? Do you keep going back to your vomit of addictions? Cry out for the power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is symbolised as fire, and when fire visits a place, nothing remains the same. When the Holy Spirit came upon Saul, the persecutor, he was changed into Paul, the apostle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the Holy Spirit sanctifies vessels for the Father’s highest purposes, and you need Him to become a chosen vessel unto honour.</p>",

Mary said, “That’s wonderful, but are you forgetting that I am not married yet? I have never known a man; how will a virgin conceive?” The angel said, “The Holy Ghost will handle that because, with God, nothing shall be impossible.” Imagine what could have happened if she tried to help the Lord by sleeping with a man, just like Sarah did when she encouraged Abraham to sleep with Hagar so He could have a child (Genesis 16:1-3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, my wife and I were praying for a certain woman who was waiting for the fruit of the womb. After a while, she lost hope and consulted a witch doctor who made some charms for her, and she got pregnant. That was over twenty years ago; up until now, she has not delivered the baby. When you try to help God, you will play into the devil’s hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>King Saul was another person who tried to help God. Shortly after he became king, the Philistines gathered together to fight Israel. It was a difficult situation, and the people began to mount pressure on Saul to act. Instead of waiting for Samuel to present the burnt offering, Saul decided to help God, so he overstepped his bounds into the priestly office and offered the sacrifice. When Samuel asked him why he tried to help God, he came up with excuses that he thought were valid. Those who try to help God always have excuses and reasons to do so, but this doesn’t stop them from bearing the consequences of their disobedience. Saul lost the throne because of this foolish act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not try to help God; just do your part according to His word and leave the rest to Him. If you try to help Him, you will open yourself up to the devil’s manipulations and make grave mistakes. I have noticed from my walk with God that whenever He asks that you wait for Him, it is because there is something glorious on the way. Don’t get deceived by the flashy things the enemy tries to dangle in front of you to distract you or push you to ‘help God’. By trying to help Him, you might end up destroying the very things that you want Him to help you build.</p>",

Being a witness means showing what it means to be a genuine child of God. All parties involved in a court case are expected to invite witnesses who would make statements in their favour. The testimonies of the witnesses are expected to strengthen the argument of the parties that invited them. Your lifestyle as a witness of Christ should strengthen the faith of others, not weaken it. Your life should draw unbelievers to Jesus, not push them away from Him. Your primary task as the Lord’s witness is to follow Him sincerely and use everything He gives you to lead others to Him. Don’t be the reason people vow never to follow Jesus because, as a witness, your life has told lies about God's nature and personality. Whenever your words and conduct speak lies about Jesus, you become a false witness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While false witnesses tell lies about what they have seen, another set of people, whom Paul called false brethren, claim to have seen things they have not. They act as witnesses when they haven’t seen anything.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul spoke about the dangers he faced at the hands of false brethren (2 Corinthians 11:26). Some of them came into the Galatian church and wanted to enslave the true believers there (Galatians 2:4); they came with high-sounding opinions that were contrary to God’s will. You must beware of false brethren because they carry a contrary spirit. They twist the message of Christ and turn the grace of God into a license for immorality (Jude 1:4). Such fellows say that once you have received Jesus, you can live anyhow because the grace of God covers you. They also feign godliness for their personal gain. Paul warned that we should withdraw from such people (1 Timothy 6:5).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as Christ’s witness, you must be careful that your life doesn’t speak lies about Jesus, and you must also take care not to fall into the trap of those who profess to be witnesses of Christ but have never met Him.</p>",

Matthew 27:51 says that when He died, the veil separating the Holy of Holies from everybody except the High Priest was torn from top to bottom. God Himself took the curtain separating us from Him and tore it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 2:12-16 says that the wall between us and God was broken by the blood of Jesus. His sacrifice meant that we could now come in contact with God; His death opened up a new era for humanity. Now, everyone has full access to God through Jesus Christ. It is because of Jesus that I can call God ‘Daddy’. It is because of Him that everyone anywhere, regardless of their skin colour or social status, can experience God’s presence. Jesus died so you can have an intimate relationship with the Father. Is your relationship with God distant or intimate? Jesus died because He wants you to relate with the Father personally. To what extent have you opened your heart to God?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The torn veil signifies the destruction of everything that can keep us from enjoying God’s fullness. Are you sick in your body? Are you in the bondage of addictions? Are you tormented by demons? Jesus tore the veil so that you can access health, deliverance, peace, and freedom. You don’t have to continue struggling through life when you can enjoy all that Jesus’ death has made available to you. I pray that everything hindering you from enjoying good health and peace will be torn like that veil, in Jesus’ name. The torn veil also signifies a new beginning. It means that the old has been taken away. You can now enjoy newness and fullness of life. While the veil remained in the temple, people lived under the old covenant, but as soon as it was torn, mankind was ushered into a new covenant. Hebrews 12:24 says that Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant, and His blood speaks for us. As we celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, may His blood speak better things into your life, and may you experience new beginnings in every area of your life where you need newness, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the veil represents Jesus’ body (Hebrews 10:19-20).

      "<p>In today’s Bible reading, the Spirit of God came mightily upon Samson, and he tore a lion apart with his bare hands. If you have ever come across a lion, you would know that what Samson did was no ordinary feat; it could only have been by the Holy Spirit. In Judges 15:11-15, when He was bound and delivered to his enemies, the Spirit of God came upon him mightily, and the ropes binding him fell off as if they had been burnt by fire. He then took the jawbone of an ass and killed 1,000 men with it. That was only possible because of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David also achieved the impossible with the help of the Holy Spirit. After Samuel poured oil on him, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward (1 Samuel 16:13), and the effect was tremendous. A mere shepherd boy went on to kill a lion, a bear, and a giant who was troubling his people and defying his God (1 Samuel 17:34-50). As great as those things were, they were only the beginning of the wonders God would do in David’s life. At one time, Saul wanted to get him killed, so he asked him to get the foreskin of a hundred Philistines as bride price to marry his daughter. It was a suicide mission, but because the Spirit of God was upon David, he got two hundred foreskins and returned unharmed (1 Samuel 18:25- 27). He did over and beyond what was required because of the Spirit of God upon him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you consider how far God has brought RCCG – from a small church in the corner of a slum in a third-world country to having parishes in over 190 nations of the world and several thousands of hectares of land as campgrounds around the world – you will know that these seemingly impossible feats were only made possible by the help of the Holy Spirit. Just as the Holy Spirit helped Samson, David, and the RCCG as a church, He can help you also. If God has told you about great and mighty things that He intends to achieve through you, or if you are faced with a seemingly impossible task, do not focus on your limitations; instead, ask the Holy Spirit to overshadow you as He did with Mary (Luke 1:35). He will supply you with the strength and wisdom you need to achieve the impossible because, with God, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26).</p>",

      "<p>Why did a whole army choose to wait until morning to attack just one man as we read in today’s Bible text? I believe it was because they were afraid of Samson, and they knew they would need light in case he turned on them and they had to run. Who can make you a terror to the forces of darkness and use you to force open the gates of a city for the light of the gospel to flood in? The answer is the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I recall when we first started to hold crusades across Nigeria in our hunger to do God's work. We would call all the ministers together at our chosen location, feed them, and explain that we wanted to hold a crusade in their city. They would come, eat our food, promise their full cooperation, and on the day of the crusade, they would all fix programmes in their churches so there would be nobody to attend our crusade. After some time, out of frustration, I told God, “Father, I want to do your work, but I’m spending and being spent without getting results.” God replied, “The fault is yours; you’re trying to do my work without the Holy Spirit.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When secret cults were beginning to take over Nigerian universities, the Holy Spirit ministered to me to take the Holy Ghost Service to the universities. I started with the University of Ibadan, and when we told them we were hosting a Holy Ghost Service, all the students, lecturers, and the Vice-Chancellor came out. To make matters more interesting, as I took the microphone that day, the rain began. Although we were in the open, no one left, not even the Vice-Chancellor! When we asked those who wanted to forsake their secret societies to come forward, because the Holy Spirit was there, thousands of people came out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, above all you do, cultivate an intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit, and He will not only empower you but will also transform your life. For example, before I became born again, I lived in fear and could not visit my village because I was afraid of the forces of darkness there. Nowadays, however, I announce my visits ahead because I have been empowered by my intimacy with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will make you a terror to the kingdom of darkness as He did with the early disciples (Acts 17:6) if you surrender your life to Jesus Christ and build an intimate relationship with Him.</p>",

Another wonder happened in Acts 5:14-16 as Peter’s shadow healed the sick. Likewise, in Acts 19:11-12, God performed special miracles through Paul such that his handkerchiefs and aprons healed the sick. Who turned them into such a wonder? The simple answer is the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was a lecturer at the University of Lagos, the dean of my faculty was Late Professor Chike Obi, a renowned mathematician. God later called me into full-time ministry and I resigned from the university system. After some years, Professor Obi, who was now retired, travelled all the way from his hometown to Redemption City to pay me a visit. I wasn’t at home, but he met my wife, and he told her that he would return. The next time he came, he saw me and said, “I just wanted to be sure that it is the same Adeboye that I knew who is now making waves all over the world.” I replied, “I am the same person, but the Adeboye you knew is a mathematician; the one before you now is a carrier of the Holy Spirit, and He makes a difference.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Psalm 71, David praised God for all He had done for him, and in verse 7, which is our memory verse, he testified that he had become a wonder. People who encounter the Holy Spirit become wonders to their world. Just as He turned the disciples, countless fathers in the faith, and even me into a wonder, He can do the same for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before I joined RCCG, I experienced a lot of hardship despite all my degrees and qualifications. However, when I surrendered my life to Jesus and the Holy Spirit came upon me, I began to experience the supernatural wonders of God’s kingdom. Difficult things became easy, and the seemingly impossible became possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of my daughters was told by doctors that she would never give birth because her womb was too small to nurture a child to the point of delivery. She kept having miscarriages, but the Holy Spirit stepped in and decided to make her a wonder unto many. She got pregnant again, carried the pregnancy to the point of delivery, and when she delivered, she gave birth to quadruplets. I prophesy that you will have a life-changing encounter with the Holy Spirit that will transform you into a wonder, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

Years ago, the Nigerian government wanted to ensure that all the people being paid pensions were still alive, so they directed all pensioners to show up in a particular place. I decided to also go since I had retired from the university as a lecturer. While I was there, a woman, who was also a pensioner, saw me and began to scream. She said that she had been pregnant for about 14 years, and she wanted me to pray for her. I laid my hands on her, prayed a simple prayer, and she delivered right there in that office. The people around there began to wonder who I was. When the Holy Spirit comes on you, you will become a wonder.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Holy Spirit releases captives and sets people free to do God’s will. During Jesus’ human ministry, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Him, and he performed many mighty miracles. In today’s Bible reading, a woman, who had been bent over for eighteen years because of a spirit of infirmity, received her freedom and stood upright. She had been limited in what she could see and do, yet when Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, laid His hands on her, she stood upright immediately and glorified God. The people around also rejoiced for the glorious thing that had been done. At another time, Jesus met a man who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years. Immediately, Jesus told him to rise, take up his bed, and walk (John 5:1-9). In another place, He restored a madman who lived among the tombs to his right mind (Mark 5:1-15). He also raised Lazarus, who had been dead for four days (John 11:1-44). Jesus went about doing good because the Holy Spirit was upon Him (Acts 10:38). When He comes upon you, you will also go about doing good, healing the sick, and delivering those who are oppressed by the devil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Holy Spirit, however, doesn’t force people or try to make unwilling vessels a wonder in their world. Are you a willing vessel? Are you willing to do His will and obey His every command? I pray that you will come into an unusual dimension of the Holy Spirit, and through you, He will perform great and mighty wonders, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

At times, however, the laws of nature can be suspended so that they do not act as a barrier to God’s children. Matthew 14:22-32 tells us that Peter walked on water. When he began to sink, he cried out, and Jesus grabbed his hand. After that, they both walked back to the boat on the water. The law of gravity was suspended for Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God gets involved in a situation, the laws of nature can be suspended. In Acts 12:5-11, when the angel came to release Peter from prison, the chains that were used to bind him dropped off by themselves, and the prison doors opened of their own accord. I pray that if there are doors that have been locked against you, they will open of their own accord because of the Holy Spirit, and you will reach heights that your enemies do not want you to get to, in Jesus’ name. If you continue reading that account in Acts 12, you will discover that when Herod sent for Peter to be brought out for execution, the guards reported that they could not find him, and Herod commanded that they should be executed instead.

Nothing limits or hinders her from running on very dangerous grounds. Where other animals will stumble and fall, a hind will run freely without any stress.

There are, however, some testimonies that people will either find hard to believe or conclude that God is partial. Several years ago, one of my spiritual sons visited me and began to share testimonies about God’s blessings over him, his family, and his ministry. At a point, he stopped and said, “Daddy, I’m the only one talking; you haven’t said anything about what God is doing for you.” I said, “Son, if I tell you all that God is doing for me, you will say that God is partial.” I pray, in the name of Jesus, that God will give you testimonies that will make people say, “Are you the only one serving God?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To receive above-and-beyond testimonies, you must be willing to serve God above and beyond the ordinary. You must also be willing to pray and fast often. In 2 Corinthians 11:27, Paul said, <strong>“…in fastings often…”</strong> In 1 Thessalonians 5:17, he advised, <strong>“Pray without ceasing.”</strong> No wonder the Bible says that God performed special miracles through Paul (Acts 19:11-12). God used him for extraordinary miracles because he gave himself to serving God extraordinarily. When you sow your service to God sparingly, you will reap containable miracles (2 Corinthians 9:6). However, when you give yourself to God’s will and work bountifully, you will receive testimonies that exceed what you can ask or imagine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A lady kept trusting God for a husband until she passed childbearing age. During one of our services, I asked everybody to ask God for something. She told God, “I have waited on you for a long time for a husband, but I haven’t gotten one; however, it doesn’t matter because I will serve you all the days of my life.” A few days later, a young man proposed to her. She looked at him and said, “Are you sure? You better go and pray again.” The man said, “I am sure; I have prayed.” The lady said, “Don’t you want children? I have passed childbearing age.” The man said, “I lost my wife, and I already have children by her.” After they got married, she got pregnant and delivered a set of twins! God saw her heart and gave her a testimony above and beyond what she could have asked for. May you receive miracles that are above and beyond your wildest imaginations, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

When God gives you some testimonies, you might pinch yourself from time to time to be sure that you are awake and not dreaming. In Psalm 23:5, David said, “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:…” That testimony was good enough, but then he went ahead to say, “…thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” I am sure that some of the people around him asked, “What kind of testimony is this? Brother, are you sure you are not exaggerating?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll share one of such testimonies with you. While I was a lecturer at the University of Ilorin, my wife and I had this teapot from which we could pour five cups of tea. Whenever we wanted to eat breakfast, my wife and I would fill the pot. After we have both had two cups of tea, the first person to finish the second cup of tea would usually go for the last cup. On one occasion, the teapot was full as usual, and after we had both had two cups of tea, we discovered that the pot was empty! As we looked at each other with a confused look on our faces, the Lord said to me, “When you were praying, you said, ‘Lord, bless this food, join us as we eat.’ I thought you invited me.” I was thrilled to learn that the Lord Jesus joined us for breakfast. However, when I shared this testimony, the brethren looked at me like I had gone crazy because I said that Jesus drank tea. It became an embarrassment, such that I had to cry to God to show me a similar incident from the Scriptures. Then, He showed me that in John 21, after Jesus had risen from the dead, He appeared to the disciples, and they joined Him at the shore and ate fish and bread with Him. The Lord said that after He rose from the dead, He could eat fish and bread, and if they had tea, He could have drank it with them also.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God is able to do exceeding abundantly above your wildest imagination (Ephesians 3:20). I pray for you today that He will give you a testimony that people will find difficult to believe when you share it, in Jesus’ name</p>",

When Abraham took his nephew, Lot, with him to the land God promised him, he didn’t think that issues would arise between them. Lot enjoyed God’s blessings because of Abraham, yet he wasn’t wise enough to tell his herdsmen to honour and respect Abraham’s herdsmen. Despite this, Abraham didn’t get offended. Instead, he settled the issue with Lot amicably. He called Lot and said, “Please, let there be no strife between us, for we are brethren.” Abraham valued his relationship with God and his brotherhood with Lot above the issues they were having. He even humbled himself and asked Lot to choose where he wished to go first. Abraham understood something many people do not understand; he knew that whenever you allow strife, you give room to the devil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During a Festival of Life event of RCCG in London, a Polish couple that had been waiting for the fruit of the womb shared the testimony of how God blessed them with a child. When the husband was sharing the testimony, because English is not his native language, he said, “Last year, I came from Poland to the ministers’ conference because somebody told me that anybody the G.O. touches becomes pregnant.” My wife was sitting next to me, and she said jokingly, “Don’t touch me; I don’t want another pregnancy.” While we were able to laugh about what the man said because we understood his background, it could also have been misunderstood because of what touches in that context could imply. Indeed, there are more complex cases where misunderstandings can arise between two people because one or both of the parties are not taking account of the background of the other party as they relate with them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, learn to consider people’s backgrounds when relating with them; this will help you to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. There are people who, because of where they are from and the fact that I am old enough to be their parent or grandparent, when they come to see me, I expect them to prostrate. Whereas there are others who, because of where they are from, I do not expect them to prostrate; in fact, I will be surprised if they do. What is a greeting to some people may seem like an insult to you, and if you regard their greeting as an insult, you will develop unnecessary anger and strife, which will give room to satan.</p>",

For example, when God sent Moses to Pharaoh to release the Israelites, He said, “Let my people go, so they can worship me” (Exodus 5:1).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thank God for freedom of worship in some nations. To a large extent, in such countries, people can go to church anytime they want and worship God however they want to. In some other nations, however, the government dictates what the church should do and not do. For example, they try to force pastors to join people of the same gender in marriage. One of the RCCG pastors in a particular country was arrested because he addressed some people as ‘Ladies and gentlemen’. They said it was an insult because not all of them were ladies or gentlemen. The aim of all this is to change the way Christians worship God and force them to worship Him the way unbelievers want them to. Beloved, God’s standard remains sure. You must not adapt to ungodly practices, especially within the church, just because the people at the top say so. When you adapt, that’s slavery. Slavery, in its simplest terms, is anything that hinders you from living life abundantly and serving God wholeheartedly. Whenever you see such things around you, guard your heart and your territory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many Christians are already adhering to the ways of the world because of ungodly policies, and you must pray that those chains of bondage be broken speedily. When the chain of bondage was broken in Egypt, the principal thing that Pharaoh said was, “Go and worship God the way you want.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Often, policies that endanger people’s souls don’t appear to be evil at first. This is why we must be sober and vigilant as believers. We must be sensitive and careful about the things we permit within and around us. Many believers keep saying, “It doesn’t matter” until their consciences become seared with the hot iron of immorality and darkness (1 Timothy 4:2). If it doesn’t conform to God’s will, it matters to God, and it should matter to you too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have been chained such that you can no longer serve God wholeheartedly, I pray that God will deliver you today. Your soul escapes like a bird from those shackles (Psalm 124:7), and may you enjoy the freedom to worship God in spirit and in truth, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Several scriptures clearly tell us that God hates disunity, and He loves it when His children are united. He said in John 13:35 that it is by showing love to one another that people will recognise us as His disciples. God is so particular about unity that He said that if you come to Him with an offering and remember that your brother has something against you, you must go and reconcile with him before returning to give your offering (Matthew 5:23-24).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God wants His children to be united because He knows that there is little we can achieve individually. He knows that the moment we begin to operate as separate entities, it will be easy for the devil to gain entry into our territories, and we will not be able to do much to stop him. Ecclesiastes 4:12 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are many Christians and Christian organisations around the world. In fact, Christianity is considered to be the most popular religion in the world. Why, then, are the governments of some nations establishing anti-Christian policies and persecuting Christians? The major reason is that many of us Christians are living in isolation. If we come together and decree a thing, it will surely come to pass. If we can come together and decide to turn the whole world around for Christ, we will be unstoppable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you look at all the times that there have been revivals in the past, one major thing you will discover is that a significant part of the body of Christ was united. At the upper room, when the disciples were all in one accord, the Holy Ghost came down, and three thousand souls were saved on that day. The Bible further says in Acts 2:46-47 that the disciples were united and more and more people were added to the church daily.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Look within your local assembly; is there unity among you? Look at the environment where your church is located; is your local assembly working in unity with the other churches in the community? If we can only put aside our differences and come together to form a united front against the devil, we will discover that nothing will be impossible to us.</p>",

      '<p>On the day of Pentecost, the disciples were gathered together in one room and in one accord when suddenly, there came a sound as of a rushing mighty wind (Acts 2:1-4). This wind shook the entire house, and until now, the world has not recovered from that event. Whether you believe it or not, God is about to shake the whole world. A great revival is here, and you can be a part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1979, I attended a Kenneth Hagin campmeeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with my Father in the Lord and four other brethren. We stayed at Mayo Hotel, and very early one morning, my Father in the Lord sent for all of us. When we got to his room, we saw him praying in the Holy Spirit more deeply than we had ever seen him pray before. It was at that meeting that he dropped a bombshell – he was going to be called to glory soon, and I would be succeeding him as the church’s leader. When he said that, we all began to pray fervently. We were still praying when suddenly, the hotel’s engineer came knocking at the door. As I was standing closest to the door, I opened it. The engineer then asked, “What kind of instrument are you playing?” I replied, "We are not playing any instrument; we are praying.” He didn’t believe me, so he entered the room and looked everywhere. As he was going out, he asked, “What did you say you were doing?” I replied, “We were praying.” Then I asked, "What is wrong?" He said, “The hotel is shaking, and we have traced the source of the vibration to this room.” The building’s foundation was tested in an attempt to trace the cause of the vibration, but nothing was found. After we left, the hotel was shut down because there were major concerns about the vibration. Since they could not detect the cause of the vibration and they couldn’t possibly have believed that it was as a result of our prayers, the hotel had to be shut down for 30 years. That was an event that preceded the revival we are witnessing in the RCCG today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When believers pray together in unity, great things happen; we can influence the world effectively and win many souls into the kingdom faster. Beloved, if you want to be part of a revival that will shake the earth and reveal God’s glory, you must become accustomed to fervent prayers in unity with other believers.</p>',

      "<p>In Genesis 47:7-9, Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How old are I you?” Jacob responded, “I have travelled 130 years; my forefathers travelled longer.” The question, ‘How old are you?’ simply means, how far have you gone in the journey of life? The moment you are born, you begin a journey on earth. However, when you die, that journey ends; then, you face eternity either in heaven or hell, depending on whether you gave your life to Jesus Christ or not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me ask you a question: since you’re on a journey on the earth, are you travelling in the right direction? Do you know God’s ordained destination for you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, many people travel through life without seeking to know God’s will concerning their destination – you cannot afford to do that. You were born for a purpose, and if that purpose is not fulfilled, you will answer to the Giver of the life you are living now. Your decisions, whether small or big, will determine your destination in life. In Genesis 13:10-11, Lot decided on where to settle based on how pleasant the place looked without finding out God’s will. That single decision changed the course of his life and those of his descendants forever.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the One who set you on this journey has a predetermined destination for you and a map for you to get there. He said in Jeremiah 29:11 that He will bring you to an expected end. While God reveals destinations, He does not provide the full details about the journey all at once. He told Abraham, “Leave your father’s house, and I will take you to a land that I will show you.” He also told the Israelites, “I will take you to a Promised Land.” He showed Joseph that he would become a great ruler, and He also told Peter that He would make him a fisher of men. All these people had an idea of the destination, but the map to get there remained with God. The map that shows how you will fulfil destiny is with God; if you stay close to Him, He will guide you. David said in Psalm 119:105:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you lose your relationship with God, you will lose your map, and you will likely arrive at the wrong destination. Stay close to God, and let Him guide all your steps in this journey of life.</p>",

      '<p>When people say, “You can do better than your best,” they mean that a person can still improve on his or her greatest achievement. However, when we talk about excellence, it means that something is so good that it cannot be improved upon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Luke 1:31-32, the angel told Mary that the baby she was about to conceive would be great. In Philippians 2:9-11, the Bible says that God gave Him a name that is above all names. John 3:34 also says that God gave Jesus the Holy Spirit without measure. What determines how great a believer will become is how full of the Holy Spirit he or she is. Jesus was excellent because He did not carry the Holy Spirit in a measure; He was totally full of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of my children once came to me and asked, “Daddy, do you know the Bible very well? Who is Prochorus?” I asked, “Is that name in the Bible?” He then said, “I thought you said you know the Bible.” He asked again, “Who is Nicanor?” I told him I didn’t know. "Who is Timon?" I said, “You mean Simon?” He said, "No, Timon.” I replied that I didn’t know Timon. Then, he told me that all the names he mentioned were part of the first seven deacons. This shows that in a group of selected people with the same qualifications and experience, some of them will still stand out as being excellent. They all had the same qualifications; however, when asked to list the names of the first deacons in the Bible, most people will only mention Stephen and Phillip.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, we see that Stephen was excellent and did great wonders and miracles among the people because he was full of faith, power, and the Holy Spirit. Being full of the Holy Spirit is in different levels, and your level of thirst will determine the level of fullness you will operate in. Beloved, to achieve excellence, prioritise being filled with the Holy Spirit at all times. Spend quality time in God’s presence, praising and worshipping Him. As you do this, you will become full of the Holy Spirit, and you will be empowered to excel even above those who are considered to be the best.</p>',

      "<p>When I got born again over 50 years ago, I had many questions because I was an academic. As a baby Christian, I had a lot of questions, and I believe my pastor would probably have gotten tired of me if I had asked all of them. I had questions like, “Is it true that God knows the end from the beginning? If yes, did He know that Adam and Eve would eat the forbidden fruit? If He knows the end from the beginning, then He should have definitely known that Adam and Eve would eat the forbidden fruit. If He knew that they were going to eat the forbidden fruit, why did He plant it? If He planted it, and they ate it as He knew they were going to, why was it an issue?” I had many such questions, and eventually, I turned to God and said, “Daddy, You see my heart; You know I am not issuing You queries. I just want to understand Your word better. Can You please answer these questions?” Finally, I got an answer from God. I learnt from Him that the whole world is a stage, and all of us are actors, just as Shakespeare, an English poet, had written. There is a play written by the Almighty God Himself, and this is why Hebrews 10:7 says in reference to Jesus:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 15:18 says, “Known unto God are all His works, from the beginning of the world.” Before you were born, God wrote a play, and you and I are to be actors in it.

You can rest assured that His plans for you are great.

Not only did He write the script, He is also the Executive Producer, Producer, and Director of the play. Psalm 33:11 says, “The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.” What God wrote in His play is what we are acting out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Actors aren’t meant to do what they like on stage; whatever the author of a play has written is what must be acted out. If some actors are proving stubborn, all a director needs to do is replace them. There are many examples of people in RCCG who had a role to play in God’s plan, but they either left the church or decided to disobey God. Since God’s agenda must be fulfilled, He simply replaced them, and they lost out on the things He had in store for them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can never be left without options. The moment He calls on one fellow to do something and the person disobeys, He will prepare another person to take over. An example is King Saul; the moment he started to disobey God’s instructions, He sent Samuel to anoint David as king in his stead (1 Samuel 16:1). When footballers are playing on a field, and one of them misbehaves or is not meeting up to the coach’s expectations, that fellow might be replaced immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Disobedience positions people for replacement. In today’s Bible reading, God gave Saul a special assignment and told him exactly how to go about it. He, however, disobeyed God and decided to do things his own way. His disobedience was a sin before God and he got replaced. Another person who got replaced because of his disobedience to divine instruction was Eli. Although God had given his ancestor, Phinehas, the covenant of everlasting priesthood in Numbers 25:11-13, He revoked it when Eli started acting his own script on the stage (1 Samuel 2:27-36). He was eventually replaced by Samuel, his protegee (1 Samuel 3:11-20).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God loves you so much, but if you start disobeying His instructions deliberately, you have set yourself against His will. Those who keep disobeying Him will eventually get replaced if they don’t repent. Do not be like them; follow the instructions of the Executive Producer, Producer, and Director of your life. Play your part in His script obediently, and you will experience His glory in all aspects of your life.</p>",

This implies that no matter what anyone tries, God’s plan for your life can never be changed. Isaiah 46:10 says,<strong> “…My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When things that do not seem to align with God’s plan for your life start happening to you, don’t despair; trust God and be confident that He is able to make all things work together for your good. For example, in the Bible, God showed Joseph a glimpse of His plan for his life in two dreams (Genesis 37:5-9). However, instead of keeping his mouth shut, he announced the dreams to his brothers and parents. His brothers got angry and sold him into slavery. They thought they were destroying him, but little did they know that they were helping Him towards his destiny. After he was brought into Potiphar’s house, tragedy struck again, and he found himself in prison. I’m sure the devil must have mocked him and asked, “Now, what has become of your big dreams?” However, God never fails to bring His word to pass; He hastens His word to perform it (Jeremiah 1:12). The bigger the challenges, the more He will showcase His mighty power.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God had a great destiny prepared for David, but the moment the oil came upon his head and he was anointed as king, it seemed all hell was let loose upon him. He became a fugitive for 13 years, moving from one hideout to another. In his psalms, he recorded how he felt during that season (Psalm 88:15, Psalm 25:16). However, despite all he faced, he still became Israel’s king as God ordained. I am sure that was why he said,<strong> “Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all”</strong> (Psalm 34:19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, no matter how much the enemy tries to stop you from achieving that glorious destiny that God has prepared for you, I want you to know that all things will work together for your good when you love God, and you are aligned with His purpose (Romans 8:28). Loving God means that you must obey all His commands (John 14:15). Don’t lose hope when negative circumstances come your way. Trust in God, obey all His commandments, and He will surely bring you to a glorious end in Him.</p>",

For example, in 1 Samuel 2:30, He told Eli, “I said indeed that you and your father's house will stand before me forever, but now, I change my mind.” That is an instance of God changing the actors that would be involved in carrying out His grand vision.

In today's Bible reading, Jeremiah was in his house when God told him to go to a potter's house because He wanted to speak to him there. If I were Jeremiah, I would have asked, “Daddy, are we not speaking already? Let's continue our conversation here.” Thank God Jeremiah was an obedient fellow, and as I mentioned in the just-concluded series, obedience will keep you at the centre of God's will. He stood up immediately and went to the potter's house, where he met the potter working on a vessel. As Jeremiah watched, the vessel got damaged in the potter's hand, but instead of throwing it away, the potter remoulded it into another vessel. By the time he was done, it didn't look like the vessel had once been damaged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. </strong></i>Jeremiah 18:4&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God can change those damaged portions of your life if you surrender everything to Him. He can remould you into another vessel fit enough to fulfil His original plan for your life. Don't give up on the promises He has made to you or the glimpses of the glorious destiny that He has shown you because of negative circumstances or past mistakes. He can change everything and make your life a beautiful story of His grace – only put your trust in Him.</p>",

      "<p>When God really wants to bless someone, He will go to any length to bless the fellow. In Job 1:8, God asked the devil if he had considered Job. You would think that God just wanted to boast about Job, but by the time you get to the end of Job’s story, you will realise that God was looking for an avenue to bless him with double the things he had already, as we see in Job 42:10: “…the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.” God wanted to bless Job, but He also wanted him to pass through a process that would prove that he was deserving of the blessing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Genesis 32:24-29, the Bible tells us that Jacob was left alone to wrestle with a Man until the break of the day. When the Man (who was actually a representation of God) could not defeat him, He touched his leg and dislocated it. Jacob kept wrestling, and the Man had to beg him to let him go. However, Jacob said that he would not do so until he received a blessing, which he eventually got. Clearly, it was an arrangement made by God, as Jacob could ordinarily not have overpowered the man. When God wants to bless you, He can do certain things that seem strange and might not make sense to you or anyone around you. I pray for you today that God will intentionally determine to bless you in this season, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God wanted to bless me, He led me to a small church in a little corner of Ebute Metta in Lagos, Nigeria. At that time, I was the most educated person in the church, the church auditorium was uncomfortable, and really, I had every reason not to stay. My spiritual father did not go to school, but I was a PhD holder! It looked as if it was only the church that was benefitting from my presence there, but in truth, I was the one who was to benefit by staying where God asked me to stay so that I could fulfil my destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God wants to bless you, the ingredients He will put together to prepare that blessing may not look like it, but if you cooperate with Him, at the end of the day, you will enjoy His blessings in abundance. If you are willing to submit to His process, He will use every opportunity to decorate your life with His blessings.</p>",

      "<p>A person’s lifetime is the period between the fellow’s birth and death. Today’s Bible reading says that there are seasons for everything and a time for every purpose under heaven. Everyone is assigned to a purpose here on earth, and after a while, regardless of whether they fulfil their purpose or not, they die. Once you leave the earth, another generation will come on the scene and play their own part according to God’s design (Ecclesiastes 1:4). The question is, during this period when you are playing your own part, will you make a mark in the sands of time? Will you fulfil your destiny or just pursue mundane things?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David followed after God so much that He called him “…a man after mine own heart…” (Acts 13:22). Little wonder he lived such an impactful life and is still regarded as Israel’s greatest king up until today. Another fellow, Methuselah, was only known for his day of birth and death. He was the oldest man recorded in the Bible, and apart from the fact that he had sons and daughters, nothing else was written about him (Genesis 5:25-27). Enoch, on the other hand, walked with God, and this made his lifetime count (Genesis 5:24). When a fellow walks with God and does His will like Enoch and David did, the person’s lifetime will count. The impact of that fellow will be felt long after he or she has crossed over to eternity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God seeks a generation of people who will fear, love, and follow Him wholeheartedly. David called this generation ‘the generation that seeks God’s face’ (Psalm 24:6). When I was younger, people had shops with small peepholes that could only accommodate a person’s hand. If someone wanted to buy something, the shop owner would stretch his or her hands through the peephole to collect the person’s money and pass the goods out, after which the fellow would leave. However, if the fellow insists on seeing the shop owner, the shop owner would open the door so they can meet face to face.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God wants you to seek His face and not just the blessings in His hands. If you want your life to matter, don’t focus on the things you can get from Him; seek His face so you can have access to Him. Don’t only ask God for material things; ask Him to show you His face so that when the world looks at you, they will see His glory (Exodus 34:28-35).</p>",

      "<p>Many people believe that God only calls individuals into pulpit ministries – this is untrue. If God only calls people to serve Him on the pulpit, then it means that He is leaving other important areas of life to the devil. Every believer has a calling in one area of life or the other. In the Bible, we see God calling people into government. Joseph was called into leadership, and his obedience preserved the lives of his people (Genesis 45:7). Daniel was also called to shine God’s light in the government of idolatrous Babylon, and he obeyed. He served under several kings and fulfilled his calling to reveal the power and presence of God through his roles in the government (Daniel 6:25-28). Also, Nehemiah wasn’t called into the office of a priest; he was called to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, and he did this joyfully (Nehemiah 2:1-5). Esther stayed at her duty post in the government house before God called her into the influential position of the queen in the palace (Esther 2:16- 17). Her submission to God saved the lives of the Jews when Haman, their enemy, plotted to destroy them (Esther 7).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God also calls people into business. Lydia of Thyatira was a seller of purple, an expensive cloth worn by kings and queens. Only very rich people could afford her wares, and God positioned her there so that she could use her resources to advance the kingdom (Acts 16:14).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God calls people to serve in different areas of life. Do you know the area He has called you into? People who live or move outside their places of calling will struggle because they have set themselves against God’s purpose for their lives. In 2 Chronicles 26:16-21, the Bible tells us about King Uzziah, who decided to operate in another office that God did not call him into. As Israel’s king, he enjoyed God’s grace and favour until he decided to operate in the office of a priest. He went into the temple to burn incense and didn’t return the same way; he came out leprous and was isolated. Whenever people operate in places God has not called them into, they become isolated from His grace and provision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if God has called you to serve Him in any area of life, focus on your calling in that area. Do not compare yourself to other people who are flourishing in other areas. Obey God wholeheartedly in your calling, and you will experience His abundant grace and provision.</p>",

In Genesis 12:1-3, He promised Abraham, “Through your seed shall all the earth be blessed.” At that time, Abraham had no child, and 25 years later, nothing had happened. However, one day, Abraham was sitting in front of his tent, and his appointed time came. In Acts 2:1, the Bible says, “…when the day of Pentecost was fully come…” God didn’t act one minute too soon or too late.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there is an appointed time for your miracle. When that day comes, nothing special might seem to be happening, but your miracle will not pass you by. You might just be going about your normal business like Abraham, who was just sitting in front of his tent. Moses’ appointed time met him at the backside of a desert while going about his shepherding duties (Exodus 3:1), and Peter’s time came while he was waiting in the upper room (Acts 2). For Saul of Tarsus, his appointed time came as he was travelling to cause havoc (Acts 9).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I received a prophecy in 1961 that I would be travelling abroad regularly. At that time, travelling abroad was a really big deal in my village, and I had not even been to Lagos State, where the international airport is located. However, when it was time for that prophecy to start manifesting, it was beyond my wildest imagination. Also, when I became the General Overseer of RCCG, I left my wife and children in Ilorin to live in a one-room apartment at Mushin (a relatively poor suburb in Lagos). I wanted to bring my family over to live with me, but I couldn’t do that due to the size of my apartment. I went to God in prayers and explained the challenges I was facing. I told Him to help me get decent accommodation. God’s response to me was shocking. He said, “Son, I have decided to build you a city.” I was asking Him for a boys’ quarters, but He was talking about a city. Today, Redemption City is the manifestation of that prophecy. These prophecies and more looked impossible when I first received them, but God has fulfilled them in my life according to His timing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if God has made promises to you, don’t be discouraged if you are yet to see them come to pass. God is not a liar; if He makes a promise, He will surely fulfil it (Numbers 23:19). Wait for His appointed time.</p>",

The Bible says that the LORD visited him, and he lifted up his eyes and saw three men.

      "<p>I started discussing about divine visitation yesterday, I and I said that people can have a divine encounter with God through His word. Today, in continuing my discussion, I will point out another way by which believers can receive divine visitation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible tells us in Hebrews 1:13-14 that angels are ministering spirits that are sent by God to minister to people. Sometimes, when God wants to visit His children, He sends His angels as divine visitors. For example, in Judges 13:1-25, when God wanted to tell Manoah that he and his wife would give birth to Samson, He sent an angel. Likewise, in Luke 1:8-20, when God wanted to tell Zechariah that he would have a child, He also sent an angel as His messenger. You may ask, “How will I even recognise an angel if one comes to me?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Occasionally, the angel that God will send to you could be a human being. For example, in 2 Kings 5:1-14, the angel that God sent to Naaman when it was time for his divine visitation was a maid. It was the girl who said to his wife, “I know where my master can get his healing.” There are many stories of human beings that God used to bring certain people to the fullness of their purpose. May God send such destiny helpers to you speedily, in Jesus’ name. Beloved, you must be hospitable to everyone you meet. This is because you do not know if the angel that God is sending to you will come in human form. Hebrews 13:2 says, <strong>“Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”</strong> Imagine if Naaman’s wife had maltreated their maid, he would have probably died a leper. Some people have sent their angels away with their terrible behaviours; do not be like them. Apostle Paul reminds us in Galatians 6:10:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must do good to everybody, regardless of their tribe, religion, social or financial status, or age, because you never can tell if they are angels that God is sending to you. Your kindness can open doors of abundant blessings to you. I pray that you will show kindness to the angels God sends your way so that you do not miss your divine visitation, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

In 1 Samuel 1:9-20, Hannah was in Shiloh praying passionately, and God sent His prophet to her. The prophet simply issued a decree, and her womb was opened. In 1 Samuel 16:11-13, God sent another prophet to visit David and anoint him as king. Also, in 1 Kings 19:15-21, when the time came for Elisha to begin to fulfil his purpose, God sent a prophet, Elijah, to throw his mantle on him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever God sends one of His ministers to you, believe what God has sent him or her to say to you. When Elisha decreed God’s word during the severe famine in Samaria that food would become very surplus and cheap overnight, a top government official doubted it. He couldn’t believe how such a terrible famine, during which women ate their children to survive, would disappear overnight. However, Elisha wasn’t speaking his own words; He was speaking God’s word, and it came to pass (2 Kings 7:1-16).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God sends His word through His ministers, anything is possible. The unbelief of the officer described in the paragraph above prevented him from partaking in the overnight miracle. He saw the miracle, but he didn’t partake of it because he spoke against God’s word (2 Kings 7:17). I pray that you will receive every word that God sends to you through His ministers in faith, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s text, we see how three countries joined themselves together against Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah. The situation was terrible, but instead of giving in to fear, Jehoshaphat proclaimed a fast and asked his people to join him. As they prayed and sought God’s face together, His word came through Jahaziel, one of the Levites. God told them to relax because they wouldn’t need to fight the battle. He asked them to stand still and see His salvation (2 Chronicles 20:14-17). Humanly speaking, it was foolish to stand still when enemies were closing in on all sides. However, Jehoshaphat and the people believed God’s word and the prophets He spoke through.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God’s word will sometimes defy human explanation and challenge human reasoning. However, God will always be God. If a genuine minister of God gives you a message from God, believe him or her and act accordingly. Believe God’s prophets, and you will surely prosper and be established (2 Chronicles 20:20).</p>",

Because the governor was going to be passing by, the whole town lined the route. I was standing behind an elderly man who was also a teacher at the school. As Zik was driving by in an open car, somehow, he spotted this elderly teacher in the crowd. Immediately, he stopped the motorcade, came down from the car, and stood before the old man. I don’t know exactly what they said to each other, but the old man began to cry. Eventually, we discovered that the old man was a teacher at the secondary school Zik attended and was responsible for his expulsion from the school.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can turn things around for you such that when your enemies come, you will say to them, “See what the Lord has done.” When the Lord turned the story of the Israelites around after they cried to Him, the Egyptians, who hated them, gave them everything they asked for.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required.

However, one day, as he sat as usual, Jesus came along.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bartimaeus knew that Jesus was the key to his turnaround, so he began to cry for help. As he shouted, people shouted at him to keep quiet. Thankfully, Bartimaeus didn’t obey them. Instead, he cried louder until Jesus attended to him. When Jesus called for him, those who told him to keep quiet were the same ones who said, <strong>“…Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee”</strong> (Mark 10:46-52).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, how hungry are you for a divine turnaround?

      "<p>Phrases like ‘God remembered’, as seen in today’s Bible reading, might look strange because God knows the end from the beginning and cannot forget anything. However, when the Bible uses that phrase, it doesn’t mean that God forgot anything, but at that moment, He decided to pay attention to something in particular. If God has made promises to you in the past, rest assured that He has not forgotten about them. They will surely come to pass at the appointed time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1979, my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, and a few of us attended a Kenneth Hagin campmeeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. The meeting ended on a Saturday, so we worshipped at a nearby church on Sunday. As it was our first visit, we were made to sit in the front row. During the sermon, the preacher suddenly got down from the altar, stood before Pa Akindayomi, and said, “Thus saith the Lord, ‘That which I promised you is about to come to pass.’” Pa Akindayomi didn’t understand English, so he asked me, “What did he say?” Because I didn’t want to miss the rest of the sermon, I said, “I’ll tell you when we get to the hotel, sir.” When we got to the hotel, he asked again. After I told him, he started crying. God had told him in 1952, “I am starting a church through you, and it will be known around the whole world.” At that time, the church was still only in South-West Nigeria. The old man was already preparing to go to heaven, so he thought that God had forgotten His promise. Today, God has taken RCCG to 197 nations in the world and still counting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Has God promised you anything? Rest assured that He will fulfil it. However, His promises will only be fulfilled in His time. After many years of serving God faithfully, Zachariah and Elisabeth remained barren and must have thought that God had forgotten them. The God who does not forget visited them at His appointed time and gave them a son (Luke 1:5-25). God’s plan was to give them a great prophet who would be the forerunner of Jesus. When people thought it was too late for them to have a child, God said, “Now, it is time to attend to this matter.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, men can forget their promises, but God can never forget His promises to you. Keep trusting Him, and He will fulfil His promises in your life at His appointed time.</p>",

This is similar to what many people do concerning God’s assignment for their lives. God has sent everyone on earth to fulfil a purpose. However, many people put God’s purpose aside and start doing whatever they like.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before your birth, God prepared an assignment for you to fulfil on the earth. Everyone created by God has a purpose (Ephesians 2:10), and God has a general plan into which His specific purpose for your life fits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Galatians 1:13-16, Paul said that God separated him unto Himself from his mother’s womb. By the end of his life, He said, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:” (2 Timothy 4:7). John the Baptist knew that God sent him ahead of Jesus to prepare a way for Him and announce His arrival to the Israelites (John 1:29-36). When Jesus came to him, he declared, “…Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world” (John 1:29). Because he did his assignment very well, Jesus gave this testimonial about him: “…Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:…” (Matthew 11:11). What will God’s testimonial about you be? You have a particular assignment on earth, and you must not let anything prevent you from fulfilling it. Determine not to allow anything stop you from becoming who God has ordained you to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While it is commendable for someone to know God’s purpose, it is also necessary for that fellow to fulfil God’s purpose God’s way. For example, Moses was destined to deliver the Israelites from Egypt, but he first attempted to do it his own way, and it almost cost him his life. God had to put him through a refining process that eventually set him on the right path (Exodus 2:11-15).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God has a special purpose for your life, and He also has the blueprint you must follow to fulfil it. This is why you cannot afford not to have an intimate relationship with Him. Your relationship with Him will determine whether you will keep in step with Him to fulfil His purpose for your life or not. I pray that nothing will distract you from fulfilling God’s purpose for your life, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>In today’s Bible reading, a Shunammite woman compelled Elisha to stop by her house for a meal as he passed through her city. She kept on entertaining the prophet at her home every time he passed by, and eventually, she and her husband built him a little room in their house so he could stay and rest during his travels. After a while, Elisha, moved by her generosity, summoned her and told her that she would soon be carrying a baby. She conceived and gave birth to a son according to the prophet’s decree, all because of her hospitality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, when the appointed time for your miracle comes, you will suddenly have a very strong urge to be really generous and hospitable. You will desire to be a blessing to people even more than before. Today’s memory verse says that you should be mindful to entertain strangers as you may be entertaining angels without knowing it. The reason for this is that God can send an angel to deliver your miracle, and that angel can come in the form of a human being. If you are hospitable to the angel, you will get the miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Genesis 18:1-14, Abraham saw three men passing in front of his tent, and he invited them to eat, wash their feet, and rest a little. After they had eaten, one of the men asked him about Sarah and told him that she would give birth to a son. Their barrenness of many years ended that day because Abraham suddenly felt the urge to be generous to complete strangers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you start feeling an urge to be more generous than you’ve ever been, please don’t resist it. God might be trying to push you to do something that will launch you into your miracle. It must have been difficult for the widow of Zarephath to give Elijah the last meal meant for her and her son. Ordinarily, a generous mother will say something like, “I can do without eating, but I cannot give you my son’s meal.” However, she felt the urge to be unusually generous, and she didn’t resist it. In return, she had enough food for herself and her son throughout the famine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you feel a strong urge to give, do not resist it; you might just be launching yourself into your next level. May God reward your kindness and hospitality towards others with abundant testimonies far beyond the imaginations of your heart and all that you are asking Him for, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

Also, Isaiah 3:10 says, “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him…” However, when it comes to decrees, God does not attach conditions. In today’s memory verse, He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There had been many prophecies concerning Abraham, including prophecies that he would be the father of many nations and that his children would be as many as the stars in the sky. However, in Genesis 18:14, God simply said, “In nine months’ time, Sarah will give birth to a son.” That is a clear example of turning a prophecy into a decree.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a child of God, there is always something you need to do to turn prophecies into decrees. When you provoke a blessing from God, He is likely to turn the prophecies He has given you into decrees. To provoke God into doing this, you need to honour Him. Honouring God does not always have to do with material things. Abraham didn’t give his visitors any gifts; he simply honoured them by hosting them in his home. You can honour God by simply obeying His commands, such as His command to win souls (Matthew 28:19-20). You can also honour Him by serving in your local assembly and honouring him with your firstfruits (Proverbs 3:9).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to honour God is by having faith in His word. In Luke 7:1-10, when the centurion sent the elder of the Jews to plead with Jesus to come and heal his sick servant, Jesus was ready to do so until the man sent his friends to say, “Lord, you don’t have to come to my house because I believe Your word is just as powerful as You are. Just speak a word, and my servant will be healed” (Luke 7:6-8). Jesus was amazed at the man’s faith, and his servant was healed immediately. Giving God thanks is yet another way to honour Him. In Luke 17:12-19, ten lepers cried out to Jesus for mercy, and He asked them to show themselves to the priests. They received their healing on the way, but only one of them returned to glorify God. Jesus then decreed his wholeness because he returned to give thanks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as you follow these principles, I pray that every good prophecy you have received will become a decree, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

In those days, I was always down with malaria, and I kept taking medications. One day, I saw an elderly man, whom I had always known to have a bent back, walking perfectly upright in church. I was eager to know what had happened to him, and while sharing his testimony, he said that he had gone to evangelise as usual when someone started insulting him in the neighbourhood. The fellow told him that if his God is so powerful, He would have healed him from his condition. On hearing this, the man said that he got angry and stood straight. He said that even though his back was burning with pain, he stood straight because he couldn’t stand hearing someone talk about his God in that manner. On getting to his house, the pain disappeared completely. When I heard that testimony, my faith was stirred, and I knew that divine health was possible. I allowed Jesus to become my doctor, and by His grace, I have not had to take malaria medications ever since. I experienced a miracle because my faith increased when I heard someone else’ testimony.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have heard a testimony from someone about a kind of miracle that you are believing God for, let it build faith in you.

      "<p>An author once said, “Life is a challenge; meet it.” I would even go further to say, “Rise above it.” Nowadays, however, many young people are seeking a ‘soft life’; there is nothing like a soft life. When I was in secondary school, my teacher taught me that every human being brought a pillow into this world, which must be used before we leave. If some people choose not to use the pillow when they are young, they will definitely use it when they are old. According to my teacher, that pillow represents hardship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If young people choose to put aside pleasures and go through the hardship of discipline to study, work hard, and nurture the right relationships in their youth, they will enjoy their old age. However, if they choose to party and play around in their youth, when they are old, they will either be lonely or have no choice but to work hard to make ends meet. What my teacher called a pillow is what the Bible calls ‘the yoke’ in Lamentations 3:27:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the Scripture above does not say ‘a yoke’, but ‘the yoke’. In other words, every individual has a yoke, and it is good for that person to bear it in his or her youth. People who don’t want to bear the yoke in their youth are lazy people. Some people are born into royal families, but they may never have the opportunity to rule if they are lazy. Who, then, is qualified to rule? Anyone who wants to rule must be ready for hard work. Those who want to rule must be ready to bear the yoke in their youth. If you want to live a soft life in your youth, then you are not ready to rule. Ruling is hard work, and it is only the diligent that will bear rule, as today’s memory verse tells us. There is no easy road to success; the fact that a fellow was born by a successful person does not mean that the person will succeed in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a youth and you want to reign in life, shun laziness. You must also remember your creator in the days of your youth before the difficult days come (Ecclesiastes 12:1). You don’t own your life; take up your cross and follow Jesus so that it can be well with you all the days of your life.</p>",

Believe me, God is fair to all. He will, at one time or the other, present you with the opportunities you need to fulfil your destiny. The rest of your life will then depend on how you use the opportunities He has given you. Today’s memory verse says that time and chance happen to ALL. Everyone will have their time and chance, but some will not seize it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When some people are struggling, especially the elderly, it is likely that they misused their time and chance when they were younger. Many people don’t even recognise an opportunity when it comes. This is why you must always be spiritually alert. Imagine what would have become of me if I did not use the opportunity of being in The Redeemed Christian Church of God correctly, or if I had left the church at the slightest provocation. At that time, I wouldn’t have known it, but I would have walked away from my destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who are easily offended often miss their opportunities because opportunities sometimes come in unattractive packages. For Samuel, his opportunity came in the house of Eli and his wayward sons. If Samuel had gotten offended as a child and told his mother that he wanted to return home, he might have missed the opportunity to become the great prophet whose word never fell to the ground (1 Samuel 3:19). For David, his opportunity came when he obeyed his father’s instruction to take food to the battlefield for his brothers (1 Samuel 17:14-20). I pray that you will discern your opportunities and use them well, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

They also said the house would collapse soon, but it has been standing for over 40 years. Then, they said, “It’s a bungalow. A storey building will take months to build.” However, we built a storey building in 18 days. They moved on to say that it would soon collapse, but it is still standing over 30 years later. In those cases, what we simply did was find a way to double time. Workers were working on the construction site day and night. That way, what should have taken two days to accomplish only took one.

      "<p>Proverbs 22:29 says, “Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.” Diligence means doing the right things to achieve a goal in an excellent, timely, and consistent manner. In Mark 10:46- 52, Bartimaeus didn’t only cry once; he kept crying until Jesus answered him. Likewise, the woman with the issue of blood kept pressing forward until she finally got to Jesus (Luke 8:43-48). If you want to succeed at anything in life, you must be diligent and keep persevering despite obstacles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I once gave a project to someone at the beginning of a year, and I intended to give him another one as soon as he was done. He was meant to complete the first project within three months; however, by September, he was still struggling to complete it, and there was no way I would have given him another one. God had opened a door of financial blessings to him, but he refused to be diligent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, Jesus told the parable of three servants who received talents from their master. Two of the servants were diligent, and they doubled what they received. When the master returned, he commended the two diligent servants and rewarded them handsomely. He said to them, <strong>“Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the same parable, you also see the direct consequences of laziness. The servant with one talent hid it and refused to trade with it. The consequence of not being diligent was not only the loss of his talent but also sorrow for the rest of his life. While the diligent servant who started with five ended up with eleven, the lazy servant ended up with sorrow. Jesus said, <strong>“For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath”</strong> (Matthew 13:12). Anyone who has the virtue of diligence will have more, but those who lack this virtue will lose even what they have.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, diligence is powerful; it will position you for greatness and more abundance. Whatever you do according to God’s will, do it diligently with all your strength. Don’t delay, and don’t quit because of limitations or obstacles. I pray that God will reward your diligence</p>",

That is bondage, and they must not allow themselves to remain under it. Parents shouldn’t depend on any government to teach their children. Rather, they should take charge and teach them God’s values from His word. If a government insists that parents cannot teach their children what is right, they should move out of that place and go where they will not be under bondage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parents should check what their children are being taught in school and ensure they are not influenced to adopt a mindset that is against God’s will. They should also check the games they play and the cartoons they watch because, through them, something evil can be positioned to influence their mindsets. If you take charge of the children and youths around you, it will be difficult for them to be influenced by an evil agenda. If you are a parent, you must intentionally create time to teach your children God’s ways so that they will know Him for themselves as they grow. Let them spend more time with fellow believers, doing things that will make them grow up into godly adults.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I moved to Redemption City with my family, my children were schooling far away, and they had to leave the house before 6am on school days so they wouldn’t be late for school. In order to have a relationship with them, we often ate our dinner in the car together as we drove back home from their school. As they grew older, I began to take them on evangelistic outreaches. Even when they were in the university, whenever I visited them, I ensured we spent quality time together. We would take walks and discuss the Scriptures; then, I’d guide them with God’s principles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parents, take charge of your children; don’t let the enemy win them over. God will hold you accountable for the children He has given you as He did with Eli (1 Samuel 2:27-31). Rise up to the responsibility of nurturing and training them in His ways.</p>",

Even though Abraham probably sensed that there was something divine and powerful about them, he did not begin to burden them with tales of his problems, such as his childlessness. Instead, he attended to their needs and waited on them in case they needed anything else. This is the kind of fellow that God goes all the way to provide for – someone who can truly wait on Him and is willing to attend to His needs first. God is looking for genuine worshippers who can patiently stay in His presence and fellowship with Him without being in a hurry to make demands (John 4:23-24). Are you that kind of worshipper?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In life, people wait for different things at different times, such as waiting in a doctor’s office for consultations and waiting in traffic for hours. However, despite the fact that many Christians do not mind waiting for hours for these things, they are quick to hurry out of God’s presence after spending just a few minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Psalm 100:4, the Bible says that you must come into God’s presence with thanksgiving and praises. In other words, no matter how pressing your needs are, you must not come to God complaining about them; instead, you should give Him thanks and praise first. You must realise that the One in whose presence you are is the King of all kings; you are at His mercy and not the other way around. You must find out the things He wants and attend to them first. What does God want? He loves praises (Psalm 22:3) and thanksgiving (Psalm 100:4). Also, He is looking for people who will intercede for others (Ezekiel 22:30), and He wants souls (John 15:16). When You give Him these things, He will bring laughter to your face.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Waiting on the Lord is the secret to getting instant answers and miracles. When you go to a restaurant, a good waiter doesn’t give you his favourite food; rather, he waits on you to know what you want, then, he delivers it courteously as fast as he can.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, have you tried to find out what God wants? When you go to Him in prayer, are you serving Him His delicacies or just dumping your requests on Him? God seeks waiters who will do what He wants, and when He finds them, He goes all the way to satisfy them.</p>",

He said in Isaiah 62:6-7 that you should not let Him rest until He establishes you and makes you a praise in the earth. Many people don’t get their miracles because they give up too soon. However, people who know how to continually knock on heaven’s doors always receive answers. Jesus told the parable of the widow who didn’t stop demanding justice in Luke 18:2-5. She wouldn’t let the judge rest until he attended to her matter. Although he didn’t fear God or regard men, the widow’s persistence pushed him to help her. In today’s Bible reading, Jesus told another parable of a fellow who went to his friend’s house at midnight to ask for bread to entertain a visitor. Jesus said that even though his friend might not want to respond to him because it was late, he would rise and give him as many loaves as he wanted because of his persistence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every problem you might experience in your life has an expiry date if you don’t give up on God. If you continually knock, the door will eventually open. People who are fainthearted or give up easily cannot get anything significant from life. Such people let go, even when they are so close to their blessing. People who don’t let go are people of great determination. Some of them wrestle all night in prayer and continue knocking on heaven’s door until they receive answers. Be determined; don’t give up on your prayers until you receive answers like Daniel (Daniel 10:2-14), Jacob (Genesis 32:24-28), Elijah (1 Kings 18:42-45), and the widow in Jesus’ parable (Luke 18:2-5).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you can grow your strength by consuming God’s word and waiting on Him in the place of prayer.

Elisha seemed to be a rich fellow because Elijah met him plowing with twelve yokes of oxen when he passed by him. However, Elisha didn’t count this as anything because he returned home, killed a yoke of oxen, gave it to his people, and followed Elijah to become his servant. Within a day, the manager of an apparently thriving agricultural business became a prophet’s servant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elisha ministered to Elijah and was known as the one who poured water on the hands of Elijah (2 Kings 3:11). The blessings Elisha got for surrendering all in service to God are unquantifiable. He received a double portion of Elijah’s anointing (2 Kings 2:9-15), became a father to kings (2 Kings 6:21), and even after his death, his dry bones raised a dead man back to life (2 Kings 13:21). When a man surrenders all to the One who made him, he will live an impactful life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From Elisha’s story, we see that lasting greatness begins with absolute surrender. Any seed that will count for anything, must first enter into the soil and die. It must surrender its beauty and strength so as to rot in the earth before new life can sprout from it. Jesus said:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</strong></i> John 12:24-25&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, surrender all to the One who made you, and He will guide you aright. When you surrender your life to God, you are asking Him to help you because you don’t know the best way to live your life. In John 15:5, Jesus said, “Without me, you can do nothing.” Paul also knew the secret to absolute surrender, and that is why he said, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who surrender all to Jesus will gain more in the end. However, those who keep a part of their lives, like Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-2 end up losing even more than the things they are trying to keep.</p>",

      "<p>Many people are called by names they were not given at birth. They may not be called these names to their faces, but in their absence, people refer to them with those names. Sometimes, these names are not based on their good qualities but on qualities they are not proud of. For example, in Mark 10:46-52, the Bible tells us about a blind man called Bartimaeus whom Jesus restored his sight. To date, however, people still refer to him as ‘Blind Bartimaeus’. I don’t know if people are currently calling you negative names, but I know that my God can change your story for good such that you won’t have those negative qualities the world describes you by anymore, and they will have no other choice than to call you a new name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever God sees that a name is hindering His work in a fellow’s life, He can change the name as He did with Abraham. Abraham was first called Abram, and although this name had a good meaning – exalted father – it didn’t fully capture what God had in store for him. Therefore, God had a conversation with him one day and said, “I want to make you a father of many nations, but your name is hindering Me from doing so. Henceforth, you will no longer be called Abram but Abraham because I have made you a father of many nations.” God also changed the name of his wife from Sarai to Sarah, which was more suitable for the matriarch she was to become (Genesis 17:3-16).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was a lecturer at the University of Lagos, a typist, whom everyone jokingly called ‘Prof’, made a life\u0002 changing decision. He said to himself, “I am a typist, but everyone calls me ‘prof’. I will indeed become a professor.” He started taking evening classes, and after a while, he wrote his exams and gained admission into the University of Lagos. Before I left the University of Lagos, the typist was already studying for his Ph.D. He made up his mind to truly change his name and not to remain a joke.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you can also make up your mind to have a brand\u0002 new beginning by surrendering all to God and asking Him to change any negative name that is hindering His glory from being manifested in your life. I pray that God will turn around any negative situation that men define you by and fill your life with joy and laughter, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>A young fellow once gained admission into a university abroad and celebrated with his friends and family. However, during the celebration, one of his father’s enemies said to himself, “This boy is going abroad; if he succeeds over there, he will return and buy his father a car. I will give him something to carry along that will ensure that he fails,” so he diabolically inflicted the boy with a strange ailment. The boy got to his school and began to feel a terrible pain in his body. Doctors examined him thoroughly and could not diagnose what was wrong with him. After six years of living in pain, he returned to Nigeria and attended one of our programmes that was held at Ibadan Grammar School. While I was ministering, the power of God hit him, and the pain disappeared. He started shouting, “It is gone!” God gave him a new song after six years of torment, and He can do the same for everyone who cries out to Him in faith (Romans 10:11-13).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1994, the RCCG held a programme in Lagos tagged ‘The Battle of the gods’. A man who attended the programme was suffering from four killer diseases: hypertension, diabetes, meningitis, and a heart problem. His doctors had advised him to travel abroad, and while planning to do so, he decided to come for the programme. The power of the Almighty God touched him; he was healed of all four diseases and was given a new song.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion...Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing… </strong>Psalm 126:1-2&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the proofs that God has turned around people’s captivity is that their tongues will be filled with songs of joy. New songs always accompany deliverance, salvation, and miracles. In today’s Bible reading, after the Israelites crossed the Red Sea and watched their enemies drown, they sang a new song to God. Moses and Miriam composed new songs, and everyone sang along to praise God for His wonderful miracles. Deborah also sang a new song after God gave them victory over Sisera and Jabin, the king of the Canaanites (Judges 5:1-31). Hannah was another person who received a new song from the Lord after she birthed Samuel (1 Samuel 2:1-10). I pray that the Lord will fill your mouth with songs of joy and laughter and give every member of your family new songs before the end of this year, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Praise is a weapon that turns situations men have already tagged ‘hopeless’ into joyful ones. In today’s Bible reading, three mighty nations came against Jehoshaphat and the children of Judah. It was a seemingly hopeless situation, but God instructed Jehoshaphat to leave every weapon behind and put the singers at the battlefront to give praises to Him. Interestingly, the enemies destroyed each other, and all the children of Judah needed to do was take away the treasures the three great armies brought along with them to the battle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Paul and Silas were thrown into prison unjustly, they engaged the weapon of praise. As they praised God, their chains fell off, and the prison doors opened (Acts 16:25- 26). I pray in the name above every name, as you engage the weapon of praise, every situation tagged hopeless in your life will be turned around for your good. The Lord will turn your mourning into dancing and fill you with joy, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Joshua 6:2-5, the city of Jericho was shut in as a means of protection from the Israelites, and the only available option was to mount a siege that could last for months. God, however, gave Joshua a strategy that made the wall of Jericho fall down without any physical weapon within seven days. When the people shouted loudly after the priests blew the trumpet, the wall fell down flat (Joshua 6:20). If you are faced with a challenge of any kind and you are yet to get results even after fasting and praying, then you should praise God. When everything else fails, praise will not. Praise attracts God’s presence; He inhabits the praises of His people (Psalm 22:3). When we praise God, we transfer our battles to Him, and He arises on our behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Praise creates a joyful atmosphere around us, and it is with joy that we draw solutions and answers out of the wells of salvation (Isaiah 12:3). As long as the enemy can keep a fellow sorrowful, he can steal his or her miracles. As long as Hannah was in bitterness of soul, her womb remained closed. However, the moment she arose, wiped her tears, and became joyful, the Lord remembered her (1 Samuel 1:10-19).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, are you expecting anything from the Lord? Do you desire a change in your circumstances? Stop whining, complaining, and wearing a sorrowful countenance. Engage the weapon of praise, and my God will remember you and bless you, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

In 1 Samuel 9:1, Saul’s father, Kish, was described as a mighty man of power who was also wealthy. Yet, Saul was obviously very humble because when his father sent him to search for their lost donkeys, he went without complaining. Even during the search, he listened to his servant’s advice to seek a prophet’s counsel concerning the lost animals (1 Samuel 9:6-8). When he became the king of Israel, he was humble in the first two years of his reign until he began to seek the approval of men. Saul forgot that it was God who appointed him king, and he began to chase after endorsements from men. The first time he did this was when the Philistines gathered against him, and Samuel delayed before joining him at Gilgal. When he saw the people scattering from him, he did what he wasn’t supposed to do by offering the burnt offering (1 Samuel 13:7-10). He did the wrong thing because he wanted to gain the people’s attention and approval. It was a costly mistake because it earned him God’s disapproval. When we allow the desire to gain people’s approval to move us into doing the wrong things, we have set ourselves against God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Samuel 15, despite his earlier mistake, God gave Saul a chance to repent. He instructed him to destroy the Amalekites. God’s command was clear: utterly destroy them and spare no one (1 Samuel 15:3). However, Saul, in his blind lust to be ‘a man of the people,’ went against God’s instructions (1 Samuel 15:24). When we seek fame above serving God, we have fallen into the trap of the fear of man because the Bible says that the fear of man brings a snare (Proverbs 29:25).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who desperately seek fame will compromise God’s standards to please people. At the end of the day, such people, like Saul, will lose out because God will not trust a man who desperately desires fame with the precious matters of His Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not chase after the approval of men. Rather, let God’s approval be your primary motivation. When you fear the Lord and serve Him wholeheartedly, He will position you to influence others for Him.</p>",

      "<p>Many years ago, God spoke to me while I was preaching, and I shared it with the congregation. He said, “There is someone here; three breakthroughs are coming for you. When the first comes, 100% of the proceeds should be given to Me. When the second comes, you are to split it 50-50 between Me and you. The third one will be all yours.” Some days later, a widow brought some money to me and said that it was the proceed of the first breakthrough God had mentioned. Because I knew she was struggling financially, I refused to collect the money, insisting that God may not have been referring to her. She insisted that I collect it, and I eventually did. I kept the money somewhere, ready to return it to her whenever she realised that she was not the one the prophecy was about. After some time, she returned and said, “Daddy, this is 50% of the second breakthrough.” I collected it, prayed for her, and kept that also. A while later, she came back to me and said, “Daddy, the bank that said my husband owed them some money before he died called me recently to apologise. You know how I have been struggling to pay back the debt; however, they said that they just discovered that my husband was not owing them. They mentioned that they were the ones owing him a lot of money, and now, they have paid me everything.” She heard God’s message and knew without a doubt that He was talking about her. She obeyed His instruction, even though it was not convenient, and she experienced greater breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some people want to be comfortable financially and have more time before they can serve God. They want to have a better job before they pay their tithes. The widow in today’s Bible reading proved her commitment to God by giving her all when it wasn’t convenient. People who always want to wait until they are comfortable before they serve God often don’t get to serve Him at all. Paul told Timothy to preach the gospel in season and out of season (2 Timothy 4:2). ‘Out of season’ refers to inconvenient moments, and those moments test our commitment to God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you don’t prove your commitment to God when it is convenient for you to obey Him. Honour and obey God in season and out of season, and you will experience His overflowing blessings.</p>",

I need power to do Your work; please give me power.” I would cry out to God in prayer from 10pm to 5am, but nothing happened for months. Then, one night, God spoke and said, “Will you keep quiet and listen? What have you done with the power you already have?” I thought to myself, “If I already had power, why would I be asking for it?” The Lord continued, “Son, what is written in Acts 1:8?” I knew it by heart, so I quoted it. He then asked if I had been baptised in the Holy Spirit, and I said, “Years ago.” He asked me, “Is my word true?” I replied, “Yes, it is.” He asked further, “If you have been baptised in the Holy Spirit, why then are you still asking for power? I said, “But Lord, I don’t feel powerful”. Then He said, “Did I say the just shall live by their feelings?” He told me that the just lives by faith, not feelings, as the Bible says in Romans 1:17. After this conversation, I told myself that I would lay hands on the next sick fellow I came across, and I went to sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I woke up late the following morning to meet a church member with her child in my living room.

Since then, I have not stopped laying hands on people, and I have seen special miracles happen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are baptised in the Holy Ghost, you already have the power of God in you.

Spouses also need to learn how to support each other to achieve their goals and succeed in all aspects of life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are married, understanding your spouse will help you avoid offence, especially when you know his or her weaknesses. For example, a man who knows that his wife struggles with managing time should not be offended whenever she takes her time to get ready for outings. Instead, he should help her to manage her time however he can. Likewise, a woman who knows that her husband struggles to express his feelings should be more patient with him and encourage him to be more open with her. In marriage, you must seek to understand your spouse’s strengths and weaknesses so you can work together to make the best of your union.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I got married to my wife, we made a vow never to be angry at the same time. We agreed that whenever one of us gets angry, the other partner should keep quiet. One day, we were travelling to Lagos from Ilesha, another town in Western Nigeria, when my wife got angry about something and expressed her feelings to me. I knew she was right, but I was also angry. As I was driving, she continued to express her anger, but I could not say anything to her because of our vow. When I couldn’t take it anymore, I parked the car and walked away, leaving her inside. After walking for a while, I stopped at a village and bought some fruits. I returned to the car and gave them to her. My wife was already worried because I had been gone for a while. She accepted my peace offering, and that was the end of the issue. I was able to appease her in this manner because we had taken some time to study each other, and we know what works for us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once some people go through courtship and then get married, they wrongly think they have learnt all they need to know about their partner. They do not realise that they have only just begun. If you are married, you will avoid many misunderstandings if you humble yourself to study your spouse with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>",

      "<p>The first equation in what I call the ‘mathematics of marriage’ states that ‘Love is blind.’ Proverbs 10:12 says that love covers a multitude of sins; therefore, married people should not complain about all of their spouse’s faults. To deflect offences, they must learn to accommodate their shortcomings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some people are known to call their spouses ‘angels’ affectionately. Though I am not against this, another equation states that ‘Angels don’t eat jollof rice.’ This is a humorous way of stating that human beings are not angels and, hence, are prone to human mistakes. It is important that married people do not have unreasonable expectations of their spouses that will keep them in a state of being constantly offended. If you’re married or about to get married, you must understand that you and your spouse will offend each other many times in your marriage. However, knowing how to deflect those offences and turn them around will help you a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I was preparing for a trip, and my wife wanted to accompany me to the airport. I knew she was likely going to delay me, so I said, “A car will move faster if it is not pulling a trailer behind it.” She responded, “Who’s the trailer?” I could sense that she was offended by what I said, so I quickly said, “I’m the trailer; you’re the car. I don’t want to slow you down.” She laughed and said, “You’re not serious.” If I didn’t know how to turn the situation around, a fight could have started from there. It is important for married people to know when to stop talking or say things that will diffuse the tension when their partners are about to get offended.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>James 1:19 is a perfect template for deflecting offences in marriage. When you are swift to hear, you will know how to patiently listen to your spouse without looking for ways to attack him or her or defend yourself unnecessarily. Being slow to speak is knowing that sometimes, it is unwise to say everything on your mind. Lastly, any fellow who is slow to anger will not easily get offended.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you want to have a marriage with fewer fights and offences, you must learn not to have unreasonable expectations of your spouse. You must also learn to accommodate your spouse’s weaknesses while you work patiently with him or her to get better through the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>",

Long\u0002 distance courtships have existed for a long time, but now, we have long-distance marriages. In truth, however, a long-distance marriage isn’t healthy for any family. A couple can have a short-term arrangement for them to be apart for unavoidable reasons, but this should not be for long.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many cases of infidelity in marriage result from the absence of one spouse. Sometimes, even married couples that live together practice long-distance marriages. This might be because one spouse leaves for work very early in the morning and gets back very late at night. Such couples are living separate lives, and one or both of the spouses are likely to form connections with the people they spend most of their time with in their spouse’s absence. Such connections can turn into ungodly affairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a married fellow, if you notice that you prefer talking to other people than talking to your spouse, there is fire on the mountain. When you prefer spending time outside your home rather than with your spouse, there is trouble. When you prefer discussing intimate issues with your ‘friends’ of the opposite sex instead of your spouse, you should retrace your steps and work on fixing whatever issues that exist in your marriage. Don’t deceive yourself by saying, “I’m not doing anything with that fellow; we are just friends.” Most extramarital relationships start from casual friendships, and after a while, the devil introduces temptations that can lead to sinful acts. I pray that you will overcome any temptation that can destroy your marriage, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re married, spend more time with your spouse and make him or her your confidant. Go out to fun places and take frequent walks together. At least once a month, dress up and go on a date. Book a hotel room or a private lodge for a weekend at least once every year so you can spend quality time with your spouse, away from all distractions. After your relationship with God, your relationship with your spouse is the most important in your life because God has designed you both to become one, as today’s memory verse points out. Be intentional about cleaving to your spouse, and God will bless your marriage, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my discussion on why spouses should cleave together. When a married couple live far apart from each other for a long period of time, they will both begin to change according to their different environments without realising it. As people grow older and have new experiences, they change, and if a married couple is not going through these experiences together, they may become strangers to each other after a while. By the time such couples finally come together, they will likely be shocked by their differences.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is difficult to cleave as one with someone you are not living with. What creates strong bonds between some siblings is not just the fact that they were born by the same parents but that they grew up together and went through certain experiences together. This is also why childhood friends have a strong bond. If you really want to cleave as one with your spouse, you need to live through experiences together. You may say, “We talk about our day on the phone every evening,” but that is not the same as physical interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you study the Bible, you will see that couples who relocated did so together. When Abraham relocated to Egypt, he went with Sarah (Genesis 13:1). When Elimelech went to Moab in search of greener pastures, he went with his wife, Naomi (Ruth 1:1). Although their story was tragic, the lesson is that relocation should be a joint venture. When the angel appeared to Joseph to take Jesus to Egypt because of Herod’s murderous intention, the family went together (Matthew 2:13-14). There may be some unavoidable situations that may require one partner to travel to another location first. However, in such situations, the family should not stay apart for more than six months before they come back together again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not healthy for couples to cause a separation in their marriage just because they want to relocate to another location they consider to be ‘greener pastures’. Anything that will affect the unity of a marriage shouldn’t be considered or permitted. Couples should do everything possible to stay together because God commands it (Mark 10:9). When they are together, it is easier to pray and agree on certain matters. However, when they are in different countries with different time zones, it is more difficult. Cleaving to one’s spouse requires being intentional about bonding, being united, and living through experiences together.</p>",

      "<p>I’ll conclude my discussion on this topic by stating that God wants His children to enjoy their marriages, as we see in today’s memory verse. However, for this to happen, they must cleave to their spouses. When you want to glue two objects, they must be in close proximity. When couples live in different states or countries for a long period of time, their children are usually affected negatively and may end up being raised by only one parent or other people. God instructed parents to train their children (Proverbs 22:6), but this cannot be effectively done virtually or by proxy. Parents’ physical presence greatly impacts the quality of training and also strengthens the bond between them and their children. When both parents live in the same house with their children, it is easier for the couple to monitor and correct them as required.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zeruiah’s story is one of the most pathetic accounts about families in the Bible. Zeruiah was David’s sister, and she had three sons - Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Throughout the Bible, I observed that there was no mention of their father (1 Chronicles 2:16), and I’m inclined to think that this was because he was not as involved in the family as a good father should be. Although the boys grew up to become mighty men, they exhibited weaknesses that became their undoing. Asahel was a swift runner, and at one time, he ran until he was killed (2 Samuel 2:12-32). Joab’s hot temper made him go against his boss and uncle, David, until David placed a curse on him (2 Samuel 3:26-29). Abishai was rash in his attempt to kill God’s anointed, Saul, and David had to caution him (1 Samuel 26:5- 12). Another person in the Bible whose children didn’t turn out well was Eli. In my studies, I observed that there was no mention of his wife’s role in raising their children, so I was not surprised that they became sons of Belial (1 Samuel 2:12).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Living in different locations might be unavoidable for married couples sometimes, but this should only be for short periods of time. Single parenting is highly challenging, and I pray that God will give all single parents the strength and wisdom to raise their children according to His will. When both parents are alive and well, it is important that they work together to raise their children in the way of the Lord.</p>",

      "<p>God designed the marriage institution to be sacred (Genesis 2:24), but unfortunately, many people in the world today do not see it that way. Many married couples treat their businesses and careers better than their marriages, and expectedly, the divorce rate has become alarming across the world. God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16); hence, His children should never toy with it. When a couple gets divorced, they go against God’s commandment not to separate what He has joined together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know some people seek divorce because they consider their marriages ‘hell on earth’. While I sympathise with them, the truth is that no amount of pain on earth can be compared to an eternity in hell. Divorce is not God’s will; it is the hardness of man’s heart that made Moses permit it among the Israelites (Matthew 19:3-9).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pain of divorce is also often very deep. It negatively affects families and can be felt for several generations. It opens doors to many vices and a lot of the decadence we see in the world today. Yes, spouses should separate when lives are threatened and then trust God for a full restoration of the family.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Married couples must stay rooted in the basics of marriage (Ephesians 5:22-33) just as successful athletes who want to remain relevant must stick to the basics of their sports. Unconditional love and submission, sacrifice, reverence, and God’s word are the basics of marriage; if couples stick to them, they will experience bliss and peace in their marriages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Married couples must pray together regularly. They must remain vigilant and never be ignorant of the devil’s devices (2 Corinthians 2:11). Sometimes, when the devil is after a married couple with children, his main target is not the couple themselves but their children since he knows that broken homes often, if not always, negatively affect children. Married couples should defend their homes and protect their children with the help of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are married, consistently stand in the gap for your marriage with prayers. God has restored many ‘dead’ marriages because one or both parties prayed and acted according to His word concerning their marriage. If you are planning to get married, you must prayerfully seek God’s counsel before doing so. For Christian marriages to be successful, couples must ensure that their marriage is rooted in God’s word and also ensure that they work together to nurture it with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>",

When you are connected to the Almighty God, no matter how much trouble surrounds you, you will always experience peace and calm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Kings 17:1, rivers dried up, and people suffered. There was so much hunger in the land, yet God provided for Elijah at all times. At one point, God sent ravens to bring him bread and meat every morning and evening. When the brook dried up, God sent him to a widow to sustain him (1 Kings 17:9). When you are connected to the King of kings, your experience will always be different from that of others around you. For example, during an economic downturn, when people are anxious about their finances, a child of God will be calm, knowing that his or her economy is in Zion, where the streets are made of gold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, when Jesus and His disciples were travelling on the sea, a storm arose, but Jesus slept peacefully through it because He is connected to the Father. While the disciples were scared of perishing, He slept like a baby with a pillow (Mark 4:38). Paul also faced a huge storm, and in the midst of it, while the other people on the ship spoke of dying, he spoke of life and deliverance because God sent His angel to assure him of safety (Acts 27:20-25). His connection with God gave him the assurance that nothing evil would befall him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are in a storm and you don’t want to be swept away, you must remain connected to God. What can destroy this connection is sin. Isaiah 59:1-2 says that there is always a gap between sinners and God, and even though His arms are everlasting (Deuteronomy 33:27), they cannot reach the sinners. When people allow sin into their lives, they leave the centre of God’s will where peace and joy reign.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Jonah chose to go to Tarshish in disobedience to God, a storm arose, and he found himself in the belly of a big fish (Jonah 1:1-17). Sin will always bring a fellow into negative situations, and that is why you must not toy with it at all. Economies and nations will fail, but if you want to keep blossoming and flourishing amidst negative reports, you must shun sin and remain connected to God.</p>",

However, I sensed that God wanted to tell me something through the joke, so I allowed myself to think about it. During the conference, I shared the joke, which goes thus: A husband and his wife had been quarrelling for a long time. Things got so bad that they said they wouldn’t talk to each other anymore. One night, the husband, who was a heavy sleeper, wrote a note for his wife, “Darling, I have to catch a plane at 8am. Please wake me at 6am.” He placed the note on his wife’s side of the bed and slept. When he woke up the following morning, it was 8am, and his wife had gone to work. He was furious, and as he fumed, he saw a note on his side of the bed where his wife wrote, “Darling, wake up. It’s 6am.” After sharing the joke, God told me, “Tell My people: I won’t talk to those of you who don’t talk to Me.” God loves it when you talk to Him, and when you do, you invite Him to also speak with you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the disciples asked Jesus to teach them to pray, the first thing He said was, “When you pray, say, ‘Our Father…’” (Luke 11:2). No father loves it when his children don’t talk to him. As a father, I enjoy it when my children spend time with me. 1 John 3:1 says that the Father has bestowed such great love on you by calling you His son. John 8:35 says that a servant doesn’t abide in the house, but a son abides forever. As God’s precious child, you have access to Him at all times. You can call on Him and talk to Him about anything, and He will respond.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a child of God, seek to be more intimate with your Father every day (Philippians 3:10).

I never allowed any negative confession to come out of my mouth because I knew that they would negatively impact our future. When the Shunammite woman lost her son, she never allowed any negative words to come out of her mouth. All she kept saying was, “It shall be well” and “It is well” (2 Kings 4:23,26). She refused to utter negative words that would aid what the devil was trying to achieve. Instead, she kept speaking what she wanted until everything became well indeed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words are very powerful. In Africa, the elders say that they are like an egg, meaning that once they are uttered, their impact cannot be reversed. You must be careful what you say and how you say it. When you speak negative words, the damage they cause may be irreparable, even if you are genuinely sorry about uttering them. Don’t speak when you are extremely angry or very excited because you may say the wrong things. You should also be careful with your words whenever you are sad because there is power in your tongue. The power of life and death lies in the tongue (Proverbs 18:21), and you must be intentional about the words you speak.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 6:2 says,<strong> “Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.”</strong> No matter what happens, always think before you talk.

Jabez was a newborn baby when his mother made a negative pronouncement over him. She set him up for a life of sorrow and hardship because she spoke when she was in pain. Thankfully, Jabez rejected sorrow and hardship by crying to God to bless him, and God turned his life around (1 Chronicles 4:9-10).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, whatever you say is what you will get; therefore, use your tongue wisely. If you have made negative pronouncements over your life or your children’s lives, ask God for mercy and begin to overwrite them with God’s word.

If you must speak, always ensure that you address the issue at hand and not the person.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The devil always likes to fuel quarrels to make people say things that will negatively affect one or more of the parties involved. Playing the blame game and attacking people verbally only worsens problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. </strong>Galatians 5:15<strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When people bite and devour each other with wrong and negative words, they usually end up destroying their relationships. Christians must not be ignorant of the devices of the devil so that he doesn’t take advantage of them (2 Corinthians 2:11). Often, the devil wants relationships to be full of strife so that he can be free to do whatever he wants, and when people say hurtful words to one another, they stir up strife. If you do not want the devil’s involvement in your relationships, you should take out the wood of wrong and negative words whenever there are disagreements because if there is no wood, the fire will go out. Instead of using harsh words when you have a disagreement with someone, your responses should be soft because a soft answer will always turn away wrath (Proverbs 15:1).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if someone close to you has said hurtful words to you in the past, I plead on the person’s behalf that you should forgive him or her. Please don’t let the words bring permanent damage to yourself or your relationship with that fellow. If you are in this situation, I declare your healing today, and if you have lost any God-given relationships, may the Almighty God restore them in the name of Jesus.</p>",

      "<p>Over the past two days, I discussed the power of words; today, I will focus on how words can heal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a Christian, you should always be gracious with your words (Ephesians 4:29). You should be generous with giving compliments and telling people encouraging words. Simply saying things like, “I like your haircut,” can bring people out of sadness and put a smile on their faces. Your compliments must, however, be genuine because God will punish those who flatter others with their words (Psalm 12:3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Ruth 2:1, Boaz was described as a mighty man of wealth. Unlike some wealthy people who look down on their workers and speak rashly to them, Boaz encouraged his workers with his words, and they responded pleasantly (Ruth 2:4). I believe this is partly responsible for Boaz’s successful business. If you are a business owner and you curse or talk down on your workers, you are indirectly also cursing the work of your hands because they are the ones managing it for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nabal, unlike Boaz, was a man who spoke negative words. When David sent his men to ask him to give them something, his response was terrible. He spoke harshly to the men and if his wife, Abigail, hadn’t intervened by going without his consent to soothe David with her words, everyone in his family would have been destroyed. While Nabal’s words stirred up David’s anger and made him gather his men to go against the former’s household, Abigail’s words were seasoned with salt and kept her family from destruction (1 Samuel 25:1-35).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you speak, what effect do your words have? Do they heal or destroy? Solomon said, <strong>“Death and life are in the power of the tongue…”</strong> (Proverbs 18:21). Apostle Paul, in today’s memory verse, tells us to make sure that our speech is always with grace and seasoned with salt. Seasoning makes food more enjoyable. A fellow whose speech is well\u0002seasoned will always attract others to himself or herself because people go to places where they are appreciated and motivated. When the woman caught in the act of adultery in today’s Bible reading was brought to Jesus, in the midst of many condemning words from other people, His words, “Go and sin no more,” brought her the liberty that she needed (John 8:11).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, let your words bring unbelievers to Jesus and show them His grace. Do not let your words be the reason people reject the gospel.</p>",

      "<p>While I was a lecturer at one of the universities in Nigeria, there was a man who was not promoted for 12 years because somebody hid his file. When God was going to restore all this man had lost, the head of his department was changed, and his replacement asked to see the files of all staff in the department. They searched for this man’s file until they dug it out from where it had been hidden. When his file was opened, they discovered that he should have been promoted at least twice, so they gave him a double promotion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can restore all the years you seem to have lost. He can reverse the irreversible and bring back the opportunities you missed in the past. In today’s Bible reading, Jesus entered the temple and found a man with a withered hand. Before Jesus left the temple that day, He ensured that the man’s withered hand received life and was divinely restored. In the name that is above every other name, if there is anything that is withered in your life, it will receive an instant restoration today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some Christians’ walk with God can also be described as withered. For example, when a Christian who used to spend hours in God’s presence can hardly spend up to thirty minutes with Him in prayer, such a Christian’s walk with God is withered. Some Christians could heal the sick and cast out demons in Jesus’ name in the past, but now, they have become victims of sicknesses and demonic oppression. If you are reading this devotional and your walk with God has withered, I pray that you will experience a divine restoration today, in Jesus’ name. The Lord will breathe afresh into you and cause you to experience a greater realm of glory than the former days (Haggai 2:9).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Job said that no matter how badly a tree has been cut, as long as its stump is in the ground and it can perceive the scent of water, there is hope for it (Job 14:7-9). Beloved, since you are still alive to read this today, it means that there is hope for you concerning any withered situation that might exist in your life. All you have to do is submit completely to the Great Restorer and seek His face for help. He will step into your situation and restore all that you might have lost, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Years ago, when my Father in the Lord was alive, he sent a pastor to start a parish in Osogbo (a town in Western Nigeria). The parish began to prosper, and the pastor felt that since he planted it, he could turn it into his own ministry. He removed the signboard of The Redeemed Christian Church of God and put that of his new ministry. When Papa heard about it, he appealed to the pastor to retrace his steps, but he refused. He said, “What do you mean? I am the pastor here. I started the work. The people are my sheep.” Papa said, “But we ordained you, and sent you here to start the work in the name of The Redeemed Christian Church of God. More so, you are not their saviour. The church belongs to the One who saved them. It is not yours or mine.” However, the pastor stubbornly insisted. Then, Papa said, “No problem, shall we pray?” As they prayed, a wind blew as if it was going to rain, and by the following morning, the pastor was covered in leprosy from head to toe.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the King of kings owns something, don’t take it as yours. When you do, you are toying with fire. The pastor in the story I shared above thought he could take what belonged to God and go scot-free. When someone has exclusive rights to something, no other person can claim ownership of that thing. God has exclusive rights to the earth, its fullness and all its inhabitants (Psalm 24:1). This means that He is in charge of the earth and oversees all that happens in it. In Luke 12:16-20, when the man that Jesus called the rich fool talked about his soul as if he owned it, he lost his life that same night.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as God doesn’t share His ownership of the earth, He doesn’t share His glory. His glory belongs to Him, and anyone who tries to steal it from Him will get into big trouble. When God does anything through you, be quick to return all the glory to Him because it does not belong to you. In today’s Bible reading, Nebuchadnezzar attempted to attribute God’s glory to himself, and he became a beast in the forest for seven years. God touched his heart and replaced it with a beast’s heart, and all his boasting stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God is jealous about what belongs to Him;</p>",

I once visited a small country where the total number of policemen in the country was twenty. That nation is recognised by the United Nations, so when nations gather at the United Nations General Assembly, the president also shows up. However, you cannot compare that president to the president of a country that has over 40,000 policemen. In the same way, you cannot compare Jesus to any earthly leader. He is the President of presidents (Revelations 19:16).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel 4:32 says that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men. If you want doors to open to you, you should befriend President Jesus. He has a name that is above every other name, and all things in heaven, on earth, and underneath the earth should bow when His name is mentioned (Philippians 2:9-11). No matter how powerful a president is, if he or she pronounces a curfew, it will only be effective within his or her territory. However, Jesus has influence all over the world, in heaven, and even underneath the earth. You should aim to be so intimate with Him that everywhere you appear, doors will open unto you as though President Jesus Himself is the One who has appeared.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can become intimate with God by loving His laws. David, the man after God’s heart, said, <strong>“O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day”</strong> (Psalm 119:97). When you love someone, you will always want to spend time with that person. God’s laws are His principles, and they can be found in His word. As you meditate on them and allow them to fill your heart, you will become more intimate with His person, abilities, and power. David also said that those who love God’s law have great peace, and nothing shall offend them (Psalm 119:165). If nothing offends you, it means that nothing shakes or moves you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>President Jesus is the Prince of peace, and those who are intimate with Him will always enjoy peace no matter the situations surrounding them. No matter how terrible the economy of a nation gets, those in a president’s household are confident that they will always have something to eat. If this is true for earthly presidents, how much more with President Jesus, who presides over an unshakable kingdom and economy (Hebrews 12:28)?</p>",

A year later, we had to double the size of the auditorium, and in the year after that, we had to expand it further. We keep expanding because I can’t settle for less than what God has in store for us. A fellow with an excellent spirit never settles for mediocrity, and I know what God has shown me.

It doesn’t matter how wealthy, intelligent, famous, or influential you are; if you are afraid, you are living in constant torment and are in bondage (1 John 4:18).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Jesus sets anyone free, He gives the fellow all things that pertain to life and godliness; everything the fellow needs to establish his or her freedom (2 Peter 1:3). Jesus came to deliver us from the fear of death (Hebrews 2:14-15). The moment a fellow comes to Jesus Christ, he or she does not have to be afraid of death anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible says in Psalm 112:1:<strong> “Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.” </strong>This Scripture clearly states that the people who fear God are blessed indeed. A fellow who fears God indeed will delight greatly in His commandments. You can’t claim to fear God and despise, disrespect, or disobey His instructions. When you fear God, you love His laws and obey them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there is no need to be afraid of anyone or anything; God is the only one you should fear. Trust in Him, and He will deliver you from all forms of fear. Put all your focus on God, delight in His word, obey His commandments, and He will keep you in perfect peace all the days of your life (Isaiah 26:3).</p>",

      "<p>Wisdom and knowledge are very important in the life of every human being. They are so important that Proverbs 4:7 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom is the correct application of knowledge. If you have everything in this world and also have vast knowledge about many things but fail to apply the knowledge correctly, you are still in lack. Hosea 4:6 says:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Scripture above tells us that God’s people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; that is how important wisdom and knowledge are. The question now is, how can you get wisdom and knowledge? To answer this question, we should first and foremost identify the source of wisdom and knowledge. Daniel 2:20 tells us that wisdom and might belong to God. James 1:5 also tells us that God is the One who gives wisdom, while Colossians 2:3 says wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Him. God is clearly the only source of wisdom; He is the only wise God (1 Timothy 1:17).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During my postgraduate studies at the University of Lagos, my research supervisor travelled out of the country for a while. Before he travelled, he gave me a very difficult assignment. By the time he came back and saw how much progress I had made within the short period he was away, he looked at me and said, “Enoch, I know you’re a Christian, and you won’t lie to me. What I am seeing could not have been done by you alone, so tell me, who helped you?” Even though my supervisor knew that Christians do not lie, he was Hindu and didn’t believe in Jesus Christ. Hence, if I had told him that Jesus Christ helped me, he wasn’t going to take me seriously. So, I said to him, “Professor Emmanuel helped me.” However, I got into trouble when he asked, “Professor Emmanuel? Of which department?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best professors in the world are only experts in a few disciplines because man is limited in wisdom and knowledge. However, God knows all academic subjects and everything else in the world. When you partner with Him, He will grant you access to unusual depths of wisdom and knowledge that will help you live an excellent life.</p>",

      "<p>When a fellow or organisation is under an insurance cover, the insurance company must ensure that such a fellow or organisation is duly compensated for any losses that have been provided for under the insurance cover. However, unlike insurance covers, God’s cover is absolute because it totally prevents evil from happening.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone is under God’s general cover, whether they are born again or not. In Matthew 5:45, the Bible says that God makes the sun to rise on the evil and the good and the rain to fall on the just and the unjust. If unbelievers are not under God’s general cover, they wouldn’t even be able to breathe. When unbelievers receive a miracle, it is always on credit, and it is a sign that God loves them and wants to be their Father.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are, however, some special covers that are for God’s children only. For example, Jesus said in Mark 7:27 that healing is the children's bread. Likewise, protection against evil forces can only happen when a fellow is in Jesus’ camp. Colossians 1:13 says that God has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. If anyone really wants to live under the special cover of the Almighty God, He or she must be His child indeed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with insurance companies, believers must pay a premium to abide under God’s cover. Anyone who subscribes to an insurance package must pay his or her dues regularly to have access to the full benefits. For example, if someone subscribes to a car insurance plan and opts for a monthly payment plan but pays only once a year, such a person will not enjoy the benefits of the policy if the car becomes damaged. To fully enjoy the benefits of insurance, subscribers must fulfil their part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, your access to God’s special cover is an intimate relationship with Him. This means that you must study your Bible and pray daily, fellowship with other brethren, and serve God wholeheartedly. Many Christians have fallen victim to the devil because they lost their spiritual sensitivity after staying far from God for a long time. It is in your constant fellowship with God that you remain under His special cover. Are you abiding in His secret place, or have you been going in and out? If you want to enjoy the full benefits of being under God’s cover, you must constantly remain in His presence.</p>",

      "<p>Today’s Bible reading tells us the story of the wedding in Cana of Galilee. When wine finished at the wedding, Mary informed Jesus about it, expecting Him to provide a solution. However, Jesus replied that His time had not yet come. Mary must have smiled and said to herself, “Son, your time will come tonight.” She told the men confidently, “Do whatever He asks you to do,” and before the end of the day, ‘not yet’ became ‘now’.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also command a miracle from God. You can pray in such a way that you will know that God has heard and your miracle is on the way. Jabez was a man who prayed such a prayer. For many years, he was labelled as a cause of pain and sorrow until he said, “Enough is enough.” He called on God to turn his situation around, and He granted his request.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. </strong><i>1 Chronicles 4:10&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t know how long Jabez prayed for, but we know the result of his prayer: God turned his story around. In the name above every other name, whatever you have long waited for will come speedily.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To command your miracle, you must know how to engage in fervent prayers and be persistent with them. James said that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much (James 5:16). During a Holy Ghost Service at Redemption City, I waved my hands as I stood on the altar, and miracles started happening. It is possible for some pastors who saw that happen to wonder, “Why can’t I also wave and have miracles happen? I serve the same God this man serves; I also pray and fast regularly.” However, they may not know that before that day, I had been praying that miracles should happen just at the wave of my hands for about fifteen years. Some of the things people see happening now in RCCG are the result of my persistence with God in the place of prayers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t be tired of waiting on God. Command your miracles by remaining persistent in the place of prayer. As you pray, take heed to the Holy Spirit’s instructions. Obey them, and you will receive your miracle before long.</p>",

      "<p>In today’s Bible reading, the Shunamite woman sowed into Elisha’s life continuously until he was inspired to find out what he could give her in return. Eventually, she got a blessing that transformed her life. I learnt from this story that if you bless a genuine man of God, you have entered into a covenant partnership with God, and you won’t have to pray about some of your needs before God meets them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have a group in RCCG called Covenant Partners. These are people who quietly lift up my hands financially. I meet with them once every year, and at one particular meeting, I was led by the Holy Spirit to say, “Those of you who have been lifting up my hands, if there is any of you in debt, God will pay your debt.” One man among them shouted “Amen” loudly. He was about 50 years old and was heavily in debt. The following week, the bank that he owed called him to meet the Managing Director. The MD asked him, “Sir, how are you going to pay off this debt? Give us a plan so we know what to work with.” He looked at the MD and said, “Even if I pay you a million naira for every day that I have lived, I can’t finish paying this debt.” To his surprise, the bank later informed him that the loan had been written off. I pray that my Father, who owns the cattle upon a thousand hills (Psalm 50:10), will do exceeding abundantly above your wildest imaginations, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abraham understood covenant partnership with God. After he went to war against the five kings who fought against Sodom and Gomorrah and conquered them, he gave Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High God, the tithes of all (Genesis 14:18-20). This covenant partnership shifted Abraham into an unprecedented realm of abundance such that when he was old, the Bible said God had blessed him in all things (Genesis 24:1). Joshua’s service to Moses positioned him as God’s choice to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land (Exodus 33:11, Joshua 1:1-2). Also, Elisha’s service to Elijah made him a candidate for a double portion of the anointing (2 Kings 2:1-15).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God wants you to come into a covenant partnership with Him through the genuine spiritual leaders He has placed over you. Honour them by giving to them and supporting them, and like the great woman of Shunem, God will meet your needs even before you ask Him.</p>",

He put you where you can fulfil His original purpose for your life. I pray that God will speak to you concerning your purpose and why He has put you in the family you were born into.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone has a specific purpose for which they were born into a family, state, and country. For example, in Exodus 3:1-12, God specifically told Moses, “Your purpose is to bring my people out of Egypt to come and worship me on this mountain.” In Joshua 1:1-8, God told Joshua that it was his assignment to divide the land among His people. In 1 Kings 19:19-21, He let Elisha know, “What you have been doing thus far is farming, and you are doing well, but the work I have for you is to be my prophet.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you stop focusing on money and you begin to do what God put you on the earth to do, you will not only get money, but you will also get much more than that.

Whom do you want me to talk to for you?” You must trust God that He will not put you in this world to suffer.

      "<p>Many people ask God for blessings; however, if God answers many of them at the time of their requests, the miracles may destroy them. For example, a responsible father, even if he is a billionaire, will decline the request of his four-year-old son to drive one of his cars because the boy cannot handle a car at such a young age. Similarly, God only gives His children blessings they can handle and blessings that wouldn't destroy them. Beloved, you must expand your capacity so you can accommodate the blessings you are asking God for. If a believer wants to be the president of a nation but cannot effectively manage the people and resources within a department as the Head of Department, the fellow will be a disaster waiting to happen if he or she becomes the nation's president at that moment. As a president, there are greater consequences for mismanagement; therefore, to save such a believer from them, God will not allow him or her to become the president at that moment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God calls people and shows them His vision for their lives, He always takes them through a process to prepare them for the vision He has shown them. When God showed Joseph that he would become a leader (Genesis 37:5-10), He took him through 13 years of training to prepare him. In those years, Joseph found himself in different leadership positions that prepared him for the place God was taking him to (Genesis 39:1-4, 21- 23). If he had become the leader of Egypt immediately after he had his dreams, he would have been inexperienced and incapable of making the wise decisions he made.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At 40, Moses knew what God wanted him to do, but because he had not developed the capacity to execute his assignment, he went about it the wrong way (Exodus 2:11- 15). God had to withdraw him from Egypt and redeploy him into the wilderness to learn patience and wisdom as he took care of his father-in-law's sheep (Exodus 3:1). Likewise, David started as a shepherd boy and went through God's preparation process for 13 years after Samuel anointed him as Israel's king.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, train yourself to be the kind of person who can handle the blessings you are asking God for. Submit to God's process, and allow Him to help you build your capacity and eliminate the weaknesses that can hinder you from fulfilling His vision for your life.</p>",

They must consecrate themselves as led by God; if not, God will lift the anointing off them because the anointing attracts spirits. If a fellow carries a measure of the anointing and doesn’t embrace the consecrations that are attached to it, the anointing will do more harm than good to the fellow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many years ago, I didn’t fast the way I normally would have done before a particular Holy Ghost Service. During the service, I ministered with the anointing all through the night because God had already given it to me. However, after I retired to my room in the early hours of the morning, I could hardly stand up from the bed. The best way I can describe what happened to me is that my bones were like rubber. I had to beg God to give me the ability to at least attend the next meeting I had that afternoon. Fasting was not what I needed to flow in the anointing, but without fasting, the anointing could have really harmed me. God will not let you walk in the anointing that will be bigger than your capacity because it will destroy you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want more of the anointing, then you must expand your spiritual capacity. God will not place a heavier weight of the anointing on a fellow beyond what he or she can manage.

Having consistent fellowship with God is the key to building and enlarging your spiritual capacity. The closer you are to God, the bigger your spiritual capacity becomes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as we see in today’s Bible reading, God requires His children to grow so that He can give them more of what He has already prepared for them.

Since she had been brought a day earlier, she attended the Holy Communion Service, which is always held on the eve of every Holy Ghost Service. She took the communion, and after the programme, she was helped back into the car she came in. As she sat in the car, she suddenly noticed many ants coming out of her body and dropping dead. She looked down and saw that the car was full of dead ants, even though there were no ants outside the car. She was totally healed that same night!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Holy Communion is a sacred meal, but it is also a very dangerous meal. This is because there is mighty power in the blood and body of Jesus Christ.

However, if you harbour anger and bitterness against your fellow brother and take the Holy Communion, you may die. If you eat the bread worthily, it can heal, and if you drink the wine worthily, it can deliver.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A woman was once possessed by a demon who was always talking with the voice of a man, blaspheming God and saying horrible things about Jesus Christ. She didn’t know how the demon entered her or how to get rid of it. She came to one of our services, and anytime she tried to pray, the demon would want to take over her voice to say horrible things about God. When it was time for the Holy Communion, she heard me say, “When you eat the bread, which is the body of Christ, you will be healed. When you drink the wine, you will get victory over the devil.” The demon in her screamed, “Don’t you dare drink that wine.” She began to rejoice, and the moment she took the wine, the demon screamed, left, and never returned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the Holy Communion is powerful, and you should ensure you partake of it as prescribed by Jesus Christ. However, you must avoid unforgiveness, bitterness, and any form of sin if you don’t want its power to work against you.</p>",

      "<p>In today’s memory verse, Paul said that although all I things were lawful unto him, he would not be controlled by any earthly thing. Paul went further to say in 1 Corinthians 9:25 that believers should be temperate in all things. These Bible verses show that God has a standard for everything His children do, including how they talk, dress, and relate with others. Unfortunately, many believers have allowed social media, people’s opinions, and societal trends to set the standards for how they dress, eat, sleep, and even worship God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The devil will always try to use people’s desires to destroy them. It is not a sin to like some material things, but you must put your fondness for them under control. For example, Samson’s uncontrollable desire for sex eventually led to his downfall (Judges 16:1-31).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, even if the material things you like are legitimate and good, you must still put your fondness for them under control. The things that you consider good and legitimate can lead to sin when they exceed lawful bounds. For example, although there is nothing wrong with eating good food, gluttony, which is excessive eating, is a sin because it goes against the divine instruction to be temperate in all things (1 Corinthians 9:25). For many people, their excessive eating has led them to poverty (Proverbs 23:21).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a child of God, you must be moderate in all aspects of life. You must be moderate in your speech because when you talk too much, you are bound to sin (Proverbs 10:19). For example, when the rich fool’s business prospered exceedingly, he became so excited that he began to talk too much, showcasing the pride in his heart and this led to his untimely death (Luke 12:16-20). You must also be moderate in your appearance. It is good to dress well; however, focusing excessively on fashion and being driven by every fad is a sign of spiritual immaturity. Believers are admonished to set their affection on things above and not on things on the earth (Colossians 3:1-2).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, to live in moderation, you must have self-control. Solomon said that a fellow who has no rule over his own spirit is like a broken-down city that has no walls (Proverbs 25:28). You must make no provision for the flesh to fulfil its lusts (Romans 13:14). When you walk in the Spirit and set your heart on things above, you will not fulfil the lust of the flesh (Galatians 5:16, Colossians 3:2), rather you will live a moderate life that will be pleasing to God.</p>",

      "<p>A husbandman is someone who tills the ground and takes care of crops. In church, the husbandmen are the workers who ensure that everything goes well in Christ’s vineyard. When worship rises to God from His vineyard, He pours down blessings, and the first partakers are usually the husbandmen (2 Timothy 2:6).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I joined The Redeemed Christian Church of God, the workers in the church were called Children of God. This is because it is children who ensure that everything goes well in their father's house; only visitors come and go without care. Hence, no good father will see his children hungry and prefer to feed strangers; children are usually the first partakers of a household’s blessings. When a Canaanite woman came to Jesus, pleading with Him to heal her demon-possessed daughter, He told her that it was not fair to give what belongs to the children to dogs (Matthew 15:26). Some privileges belong to children alone, and similarly, only God’s children who worship and serve Him wholeheartedly have access to special privileges from Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2 Timothy 2:6, the Bible says that the husbandman who labours should be the first partaker of the fruits. This implies that there are some husbandmen who do not labour. God expects certain things from husbandmen. First of all, He expects them to be diligent as they tend to the responsibilities that He has given them in His vineyard. These can be within a department in the church – it can be arranging the chairs, washing the toilets, taking care of children, or serving as ushers. If you are a husbandman, whatever your duty is, do it diligently. When you labour diligently, you will be a first partaker of the fruits of God’s blessings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God also expects faithfulness from husbandmen (1 Corinthians 4:2). When God gives you a task, He wants you to do it faithfully. Being faithful is proving yourself worthy of trust. It also involves managing resources efficiently. When you are faithful, God can trust you with people, ideas, and resources; He can trust you to do His will. When you are faithful in the little God gives you, He will trust you with more (Luke 16:10-11).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, ensure that you labour diligently and faithfully as a husbandman in God’s vineyard so you can be a first partaker of His blessings. If you are not yet a worker in your local assembly, now is the time to take up some responsibilities in your church.</p>",

Going to church, working in a church, fasting, and praying can all be mere religious activities if you don’t reflect Christ in your daily life. Some people grew up in the church and are used to Christian religious activities but actually live in sin like unbelievers. The way to really know if you have Christ in you is through the changes that have happened in your life since you became born again. If after two years, for example, the Holy Spirit has not influenced a change in some of your character traits, then you have probably just been playing religion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some people pray for hours, yet they lie habitually. Some even work miracles, yet they have unforgiveness in their hearts. While activities such as praying, fasting, evangelising, and so on are important, you must not forget the most important thing – being like Christ. All those activities are a means to an end and not the end in themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Child of God, if you want to truly be like Christ, soak yourself in the word of God by studying your Bible diligently. When you study the Bible, you are fellowshipping with Christ Himself because He is the Word (John 1:1). John 17:17 says that sanctification comes by the word, Ephesians 5:26 says that we are cleansed by the word, and Psalm 119:11 teaches us that when we keep God’s word in our hearts, it will keep us from sinning against Him. True transformation happens when you fellowship with God through His word. James 1:23 likens God’s word to a mirror. When people check themselves in a mirror, they don’t do it for mere formality but because they want to check their appearance and make changes or adjustments where necessary. When you study God’s word, your desire should be for Him to transform your thoughts, attitudes, and character through the power in His word. If you were short tempered before you started reading the Bible, God’s word should take away your angry nature and transform you into a patient and calm fellow. If you were sad and sorrowful, His word should take away that garment of heaviness and replace it with praise and joy (Isaiah 61:3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must allow God’s word to dwell richly in you in all wisdom (Colossians 3:16) so that y</p>",

Many people have become so obsessed with their physical appearance that they spend lots of time and money on artificial hair, make-up, cosmetic surgery, and revealing clothes, thinking this will make them more attractive. This sort of obsession is not befitting of Christians. For example, applying heavy cosmetics and undergoing cosmetic surgery is a way of telling God that He has not created you the right way. Wearing tight and revealing clothes is also a way of saying that you’re cheap and available. As a genuine Christian, your true beauty is not determined by your outward appearance but by the things that lie within you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should only give moderate time and attention to your looks. If a believer spends three hours dressing up every morning, I wonder if he or she has a quiet time with God at all. Colossians 3:2 says that your primary focus should be on things above, not things on the earth. Matthew 6:21 also says that where your treasure is, there will your heart be. If you are spending so much resources on your outward appearance, it shows where your heart actually is and what you are really focused on. Some Christians go as far as getting cosmetic surgery to enhance certain parts of their body. Some of them cannot sacrifice their comfort for the sake of the gospel, but they are willing to risk their lives to enhance their appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is good to look good, but please pay more attention to looking more beautiful on the inside than you are on the outside. What makes a person really beautiful is his or her character and good deeds. Dorcas was full of good works and generosity. She was vibrant in her relationship with God and fervent in her love for humanity. When she died, the people in her community refused to let her go. They sent for Peter to come and wake her up because her impact was truly powerful (Acts 9:36-42). If all she was known for were her face and body structure, nobody would have gone the extra mile to get Peter to wake her from the dead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you live for God, your life will be truly beautiful, and long after you have crossed over to eternity, people will still be blessed by your impact.

This means that any food a person eats that weakens or shortens his or her life is not good for the fellow. In today’s Bible reading, God gave the Israelites instructions on what to eat and what not to eat. Modern day scientists have discovered that the foods God allowed them to eat are good for our health, while the ones He said they shouldn’t eat are bad for our health. I believe this contributed to their unusual strength and vigour in the wilderness (Psalm 105:37).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God cares about your health. He doesn’t want you falling sick all the time because sickness doesn’t glorify Him. Don’t eat junk foods that endanger your health and then run to God to seek healing when the doctor’s report comes out. You should glorify Him with your body by eating only foods that will keep you healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, many crops are grown and preserved with chemicals. This is why you should have your own garden and grow some of your own food if you have the opportunity to do so. When people contract diseases, they hardly trace them to the food they eat. However, some of the foods they eat are silent killers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As good and important as food is, it can also make a fellow weak spiritually and physically. When you see people who have become obese because they eat whatever they like whenever they like, you will notice that they are usually weak. If you notice that getting up from a seat takes longer and requires more effort than it should, you should check your diet. Besides checking what you eat, it is also important to check when you eat. You cannot eat very heavy food late in the night and expect to wake up in the middle of the night to pray. Those who eat for strength don’t just eat anything; they eat what will make them strong. Fruits and vegetables will provide you with strength, therefore you should eat a lot of them. Also, avoid eating excessive sugary foods as too much sugar, like any other thing, is harmful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God needs you to be fit and healthy so you can express His glory on the earth and fulfil your destiny in Him.

The flesh and the spirit are constantly at war (Galatians 5:17), and only soldiers – those who live a life of discipline – can win. Therefore, as a Christian, you should always be spiritually alert; if you’re a glutton, you’ll likely be spiritually dead because you’ll find it difficult to discipline yourself to fast. In Matthew 6:16, Jesus said, <strong>“…when ye fast…”</strong> He said ‘when’, not ‘if’, implying that every Christian is expected to fast. Also, there is a level of spiritual authority that can only be attained when fasting is added to prayer (Matthew 17:14-21).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the spiritual dangers of gluttony, gluttons also endanger their physical health. Proverbs 23:2 says that those who are controlled by their appetites should put a knife to their throats because they are trying to kill themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God didn’t design your body to eat too much food. You shouldn’t eat until your stomach is overly filled. Overeating makes you weak and gives your body extra work in digesting the excess food. Years ago, some scientists performed an experiment with two groups of rats. They fed the first group excessively, and before long, they became very fat. They fed the second group with just the right amount of food they required. After a while, they injected both groups of rats with a disease. All the overfed rats died, while the rats in the second group survived. Your body is stronger and can fight diseases better when you eat moderately and correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Christians who are really serious about their destiny don’t eat every day. Despite my age, I still fast because I want to finish strong. In 1984, I was on a 40-day fast, lying weak on my prayer mat, when someone came in, saw me, and asked, “What else are you looking for in life that is making you fast this much?” That was many decades ago; look how far I have come since then.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have surrendered your life to Christ, rest assured that God wants you to live an impactful and fulfilling life. You are a soldier for Christ, so you must exercise self-control with all things (1 Corinthians 9:25). To enjoy this life, you cannot be a glutton. Soldiers have a regulated diet and hence, must exercise self-control with food for their own good.</p>",

If you ignore the little profit from physical exercise, no matter how godly you are, you just may shorten your lifespan here on earth by yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people today want to live a soft life.

You need to be in good physical shape to do the things that God put you on the earth to do. Therefore, you should always find time to exercise your body so that you can remain physically fit for God’s use.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, a lot of people are living endangered lives because they do not exert themselves physically. They move from air conditioned rooms in their houses to air conditioned cars and then air conditioned offices. Many people will not even attend a church without air conditioning. However, doctors advise that it is important to sweat. It is also important to stay under the sun for a while every day, especially around midday, because sunlight has tremendous qualities that are good for the body. Personally, I exert myself physically by going on prayer walks regularly. The walks help me to stay in good shape physically, while the prayers help me to maintain good spiritual health.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God cares about the health of your body (3 John 1:2). He cares about how you treat the container that He has given to you to enable you to fulfil your purpose on earth. Regular exercise will help you manage your weight, and it will help strengthen your bones and muscles. It will also reduce your risk of getting sick and improve your ability to perform your daily activities effectively. Regular exercise will also improve your mental health. If you have a job that requires you to sit for long periods of time, or if you work from your home, physical exercise must be part of your daily routine. Do not let your desire for a soft lifestyle shorten your lifespan.</p>",

      "<p>Some years ago, a man’s wife ran mad, and she was S taken to a herbalist for treatment. After being with the herbalist for so long, she didn’t get any better; rather, she only grew worse. Somebody told me about the situation, and I decided to go and pray for the woman. When I got there, I said a simple prayer and left. After I left, some people contacted her husband and said, “This man came and prayed for only two minutes. Two minutes of prayer for this kind of problem?!” Since they didn’t believe that the prayer worked, they decided to take her to a psychiatric hospital. When they got there, the specialist said, “Let us observe this woman for a while so we can know the type of medication to administer to her.” After two weeks, the specialist sent for her husband and told him, “If you say there is something wrong with this woman, then there must be something wrong with you.” With no medication and just a simple prayer, she was healed completely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Kings 18:36-38, Elijah's prayer that brought down fire must have just been for a few minutes. When ministers of God say simple prayers and great miracles happen, it is because they have spent hours with God in secret. When Jesus walked on the earth, He only had to speak once for every miracle He performed to happen. However, the Bible records in many instances that He would retreat from His disciples and other people to go to a solitary place to pray, just as we see in today’s memory verse. This is the secret to simple prayers that carry so much power.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every time Elijah prayed in the Bible, his prayers were short and very effective. In 2 Kings 1:9-12, when he decreed that fire should fall from heaven and consume the two captains and the soldiers they were in charge of, it was with a few words, “<strong>If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty.”</strong> Today’s Bible reading tells us the secret behind those simple but powerful decrees – Elijah was a man like us who prayed earnestly and fervently, and God answered him (James 5:17). If you want to pray simple but powerful prayers in public, you must labour fervently and earnestly in prayers in the secret place. Profound public results are only birthed by intense secret sacrifices.</p>",

Just as the individuals in a team cannot compete against their teammates and expect to win, couples who compete against each other should not expect a successful marriage. A house divided against itself cannot stand (Mark 3:25). A husband and his wife are one and should work together as a team to achieve success in their marriage and in life (Mark 10:7-8).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some highly successful women have allowed pride into their hearts such that they stop submitting to their husbands. Up until today, my wife cooks my meals. When the situation permits, she irons my clothes, and I iron hers too. When I was a teacher, and we were living in a remote location, she used to cut my hair. Just like the virtuous woman’s husband in today’s Bible reading, my heart safely trusts in her. She is never too busy to help me, and she upholds anything I uphold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I remember when we were building the Mount Carmel Prayer Village. It was a massive project, but I went there only thrice – the day the foundation laying ceremony was done, the day I decided to take my grandchildren there, and the day the completed project was dedicated. Throughout the duration of the construction, my wife supervised the project diligently – that is a helpmeet indeed! She is always willing to go through the necessary rigours to see that I achieve my goal. She has stood by me through thick and thin, which is why she has full access to everything God blesses me with. When a responsible man has a true helpmeet as a wife, he’ll go the extra mile to protect her and make her comfortable and happy. I often say that a fellow can slap me, and I’ll turn the other cheek, but if anyone touches my wife, such a fellow will have my God, the Consuming Fire, to contend with.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a wife, can your husband rely on you? You must be able to make up for his weaknesses, celebrate his successes, and be his number one cheerleader. If you are a man that has a helpmeet indeed by his side, you must nourish and cherish her. She is a priceless gem and must be treated as one.</p>",

I have been married for 57 years, and sometimes, it feels like my wife and I are still on honeymoon. I was the poorest among those wooing her before we got married, but I told her that if she married me, everything I would ever have and become would be hers. When we first got married, during our meals, we would playfully struggle over one piece of ponmo, but today, even if we want to eat a whole cow, we can do so because God has truly blessed us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When things are tough, a true helpmeet encourages her husband; she supports him without making him feel less about himself. She does not help him and then turns around to say, “You see what I did for you? Now you owe me so and so.” It is a thing of joy for a true helpmeet to see opportunities to help her husband and then go ahead to help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A helpmeet indeed is known during times when her husband is going through challenges. Years ago, I decided to fast because I was facing some serious challenges. I fasted for 40 days and nights, and because my wife knew that it wouldn’t be easy for me to concentrate on my fast if she didn’t join me, she fasted as well. After fasting and praying for 40 days and nights, the challenges remained, so I decided to go on another fast for 40 days and nights. Again, she joined in the fast. After the second round of fasting, the challenges remained, so I decided to go again. This time, I planned to fast until God answered me. I didn’t want my wife to go all the way with me, so we agreed that if after 40 days, the challenge remained, I would continue fasting, and she would stop. After 40 days and nights elapsed, she refused to stop. When I saw that she wasn’t going to stop, I told God, “I cannot bear to lose my wife. Whenever You want, You can solve this problem, but I have to stop fasting now.” She only stopped fasting when I stopped, and of course, God proved Himself faithful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a married woman, try as much as God helps you to help your husband resolve his challenges. A true helpmeet is her husband’s greatest ally, not his greatest headache in the midst of life’s challenges.</p>",

When God’s face shines on you, you will receive a fragrance of His favour that will ensure that everywhere you go, people will find themselves showing you favour without knowing why.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1976, while I was a young lecturer, I attended a global conference of Applied Mathematicians in Canada as one of two delegates from Nigeria. At that time, I had only written 12 academic papers. In contrast, the man who gave the opening speech at the conference had published 150 papers! He spoke about the mathematics of the rain – I had never heard anything like that before. I looked around and asked, “God, what am I doing here?” I was supposed to present my paper the next day, so I prayed to God all night that He should glorify His name in my life during my presentation. I also prayed that the man wouldn’t attend my presentation because he was probably going to think to himself, “Who brought this idiot here?” The time for my presentation came, and behold, the man was sitting right in front of me! However, when I finished presenting my paper, he stood up and began to clap. When everybody saw him clapping, they got up and began to clap too. My paper was not as special as the other papers that had been presented, but God had put His fragrance of favour on me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God puts His favour upon you, things will work effortlessly in your favour. When He put His favour on the Israelites, the Egyptians, who had tormented and tortured them for four hundred and thirty years, gave them everything they asked for.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. </strong>Exodus 12:36 &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s favour on a man will make even those who hate him to do everything to bless him. They will not understand why they are going the extra mile to give him all he needs. God’s favour on Esther made everyone who looked at her to accept her immediately. It also made the king choose her out of the many other damsels (Esther 2:15-17). When God lifts His countenance upon a fellow, that person becomes attractive to everyone who looks at him or her. I pray that God will lift His countenance upon you, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

She ran to Elisha for help, and the man of God gave her instructions that seemed foolish. He told her to borrow many empty vessels from her neighbours and pour from the little bottle of oil she had into them. Miraculously, all the empty vessels were filled with oil. A lot of times, God’s instructions might seem not to make sense, but if you can just obey Him, you will experience a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many years ago, the General Superintendent of the RCCG, my Father in the Lord, Pa Josiah Akindayomi, told all the church workers at a meeting that the church had a great need that must be met by the following week. He added that all the workers should close their accounts and bring the money in them to church the next Sunday. My wife and I obeyed; we closed our savings accounts and took the money to church. The following Sunday, Papa said that the need had been met and asked how many people had closed their accounts. My wife and I raised our hands, but when I looked around, no other hands were raised. I began to think to myself, “It seems I have run mad in the name of religion,” then I heard God say, “Son, you are not mad; I am setting you up so that when I take you to the height I plan to take you, nobody will be able to accuse me of being partial.” It is usually not convenient to obey God’s instructions. However, if you dare to obey, you will enjoy unusual results.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, Naaman, the Syrian, went to Elisha expecting a miracle. He expected the prophet to come outside and lay hands on him, but Elisha sent a messenger to him with a simple instruction: go to River Jordan and bathe seven times. As long as he kept arguing with that instruction, he remained a leper. However, the moment he obeyed the instruction, he was healed, and his flesh became like that of a little child.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God is always willing to give you a miracle, but you must obey His instructions even when they seem foolish.</p>",

I turned to God, “Daddy, it would be good if I could get £50.” Shortly after, my phone rang. The fellow on the line said, “Biyi?” I told him there was nobody with that name where I was, and as we talked, he got to know who I was. Excitedly, he called out to his brother, telling him that he was speaking with me. Apparently, they had been discussing how they could see me, and now, I was on the phone with them. Eventually, they came over, we talked, and as they were leaving, they gave me £50. Immediately they left, I said, “Daddy, if I knew it would be this easy, l would’ve asked for £100.” As I rejoiced over the £50, the doorbell rang, but before l got to the door, an envelope had been slipped under the door. I opened it and realised it came from a wealthy man who had never given me a dime before. Inside was £50 and a note saying, “I just felt like giving you some money.” Then, I told God that if I had known that another £50 would come, I would have asked for an extra £50. That night, before l slept, someone gave me another £50! I became afraid and told God that l was only joking and didn’t want to offend Him. God reminded me of this incident recently and told me I had been foolish. “If you asked Me for £50 and l provided it, why didn’t you ask for £5,000?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, find out God’s will concerning your needs and ensure your requests are in alignment with it.

      "<p>Many times, believers ask God for things and then begin to think about how He will achieve them. In reality, however, our brains cannot understand how God will do the things He wishes to do. For instance, when a man says he has a PhD in Mathematics, it may sound like a big deal, but in truth, he can only be a specialist in an aspect of the subject. If he finds himself among fellow mathematicians, they will begin to ask him questions like, “What is your area of specialisation?” If he says, “Applied Maths”, they might further ask, “What section of Applied Maths?” He might respond, “Fluid Dynamics”. They can still ask, “What section of Fluid Dynamics?” The questioning can go on until it becomes evident that his PhD degree is just a little pin-head in Mathematics. It will take you over 1,000 years to know all there is to know about Mathematics. However, God knows all Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, and all other subjects, including those that are yet to be discovered. You simply can’t compare your wisdom and knowledge to His. Why, then, do believers try to calculate how He will choose to do something?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I became the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God in 1981, quite a few people in the church thought that my appointment was rigged. They thought that I used my position as a Mathematics lecturer to manipulate the General Superintendent because he was uneducated. I looked up to God to show the people that I did not manoeuvre my way into becoming the General Overseer and that He chose me Himself. God then began to do something extraordinary. We used to hold monthly seminars for some days, and on the first day of each seminar, a woman would deliver a baby boy in our maternity centre. After several months of this happening, it became clear that it was not coincidental, and those with spiritual understanding among us discerned that it was a sign from God confirming that He had chosen me Himself. I could never have imagined that God would use this as one of the ways to confirm that He had chosen me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you ask God for something, please don’t ever think of how He will do it because it is beyond you.

How do you know God?” I replied, “He’s my saviour.” Then he asked, “Who am I talking to?” I told him my name, and that was how God used him to answer my request for £50.

      "<p>In Matthew 6:9, Jesus taught us to start our prayers with Our Father. God is a ‘family man’. He loves the concept of family and hates loneliness. In Genesis 2:18, He said that it is not good that a man should be alone. If you’re of marriageable age and can’t seem to find the right companion to get married to, or if there are forces preventing you from getting married, I pray that the tide will turn this year, in Jesus’ name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During one of our programmes several years ago, God’s word came that the mother of one of the sisters in the congregation was diabolically preventing her from getting married. God said that the mother would be buried within seven days if she continued to prevent her daughter from getting married. The following day, a lady came with her mother to my office. The mother was furious, and she said, “You stupid prophets brainwash our girls. Imagine telling my daughter that I am responsible for her not getting married.” I replied, “Me? Sister, did I say that? What God said is that the mother of a sister in the congregation was preventing her from getting married. Did I mention your name?” Then I turned to the mother, “Mama, don’t mind her. Nobody mentioned her name.” The mother then asked her daughter to leave my office because she wanted to speak with me alone. As her daughter went out, she turned to me, “Pastor, is it true that the mother of the fellow concerned will die?” I said, “I’m not talking about you, but what God said will come to pass. Before the week ends, whoever it is will be buried.” The woman began to stammer, “I’m not asking her not to marry, but who is going to take care of me after she’s married?” I said, “That’s simple; I can make her and her husband promise to take good care of you.” The lady, who was almost 40 years old and had not had any suitors, got married within six months.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, God promised that nobody will lack their mate. If you are feeling lonely, I pray that God will restore the broken relationships in your life or send the right companions your way. For someone reading this today, God will deal with anybody who says that you will not get married. He will settle you maritally in due time, in Jesus’ name. God’s word will never fail; keep trusting in Him.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I explained that God doesn’t want you to be lonely. He wants you to be part of a family. Indeed, a man and his wife are a family, but God doesn’t want to stop there; He wants the man and his wife to be fruitful and for their union to bring forth children. If you’re married and have been waiting on God for the fruit of the womb, congratulations because the wait is over. In Genesis 1:26-28, He issued a command to you to be fruitful and multiply. In Exodus 23:26, He said that there shall be none barren in the land, and in 1 Samuel 2:5, He promised that the barren will bear seven children. You might be saying, “God, all I want is one child.” Well, just know that you can bear as many children as you want; where you choose to stop depends on you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Several years ago, we held a programme in a town called Ota in Ogun State, Nigeria. A lady who had been barren for about twelve years attended and asked that we pray for her because her husband’s relatives had threatened to throw her out of her matrimonial home within that year if she did not bear a child. I prayed for her, and she left. The following year, we were holding another programme elsewhere, and there was a long queue of people who wanted me to pray for them. Unknown to me, the lady was also there, and when it got to her turn, she kept opening her mouth to speak, but she said nothing. Eventually, she was able to utter just one word, “Jesus!” When she could finally speak, she said that she was the barren woman I had prayed for the previous year. That was when I realised why she had been speechless; she was overjoyed because she had given birth to twins – she was carrying them in both of her arms!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God hates all forms of barrenness because it goes against His command to be fruitful and multiply in Genesis 1:26-28. If you are experiencing marital, financial, material, mental, or any other form of barrenness in your life, I pray that God will cause you to sing for joy because of His abundance in those areas of your life, in Jesus’ name. Also, if you are reading this devotional today and you’re waiting for the fruit of the womb, in the name above all other names, your womb is opened. Go and carry your children, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Years ago, there was a lady who had been trusting God for a partner for many years until she reached menopause. During a crusade, I said that everyone should ask God for whatever they wanted, and the lady turned to God and said, “Lord, I am not going to bother you about a husband anymore. There is no point, as I can no longer have a child. I will serve you all the same anyway.” The Almighty God heard her, and not long after that, a man came to her and said, “Thus saith the Lord, you are to be my wife.” Surprised, she asked him to go and pray again to be sure that he had heard from God. However, the man insisted that he had prayed and heard from God. Then she asked him, “Don’t you want children? Because I can’t have children at my age.” The man replied, “That is not a problem because I already have children. I lost my wife, and all I need now is a companion and a mother for my children.” They got married, and the woman who thought that she could no longer have children gave birth to a set of twins nine months later. God is not limited by time at all; He can speed up time or reverse it as He pleases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God holds times and seasons in His hands, and He can change them however He pleases (Daniel 2:21). If men say it is over for you, ignore them. God is the only One who has the final say in your life; He is Alpha and Omega (Revelation 1:8). When men said it was over for Abraham and Sarah, God reversed the time and caused them to laugh (Genesis 21:6-7). Even when Lazarus’ sisters thought that he was dead and gone, Jesus came and announced, “I am the resurrection and the life” (John 11:25).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God visits a fellow, He restores any wasted years that might exist in his or her life. As long as you are alive and God is your Father, your time is not gone. Your times are in God’s hands, and if He hasn’t said it is over, who are you to say that your time has passed? Confess God’s word and not your present reality. Only God has the right to close your case, and since you are still alive, it means that He hasn’t closed it, and He still has a lot in store for you.</p>",

      "<p>I once visited a family, and unknown to me at the time, the woman of the house was a witch who had made an evil covenant to kill one of every two children that she gave birth to diabolically. She had a little daughter and had planned to kill the girl that same day I visited. As I was about to leave, the little girl, who was carried on her mother’s back, stretched towards me such that I was compelled to carry her. I learned afterwards that up to that moment, the girl never allowed anyone else to carry her besides her parents. It almost seemed like someone whispered to her, “Here is someone God can use to turn the plan of the enemy to nought.” I carried her and prayed for her without knowing of the evil plans concerning her, “Father, bless this child; keep sickness and death away from her.” Immediately, the yoke was broken! The girl survived the attack, and not long after, her mother confessed all her evil plans and deeds. I pray that every satanic yoke upon anyone reading this devotional is broken now, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people are being oppressed by demons. They find it difficult to fight those demons off because they are humans, and the demons are spirits. The question is, how do you fight an enemy you cannot see? Well, you need a partner who can see your enemy. That partner also has to be stronger than your enemy so that he or she can defeat the enemy for you. God is a Spirit (John 4:24), and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that wherever the Spirit of God is, there is liberty. In other words, if you invite God into your situation and He fights for you like He did when I prayed for that little girl, victory is sure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, the madman of Gadara was completely bound by forces of darkness, but as soon as Jesus Christ stepped into his situation, not only was he set free, his destiny was also restored. Whatever the devil may have stolen from you will be restored today, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Jesus was on the earth, He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil because God was with Him. When God is with you, every yoke of darkness breaks. If you are experiencing any form of bondage in any area of your life, invite Jesus today, and you will enjoy total freedom.</p>",

      "<p>Parents cannot raise their children all by themselves. This is because many other factors are involved in a child's destiny that parents cannot control. Some of these factors include the environment where their children are growing up, the people they interact with, their genetic makeup, and even spiritual forces that surround their entire family and the children in particular. This is why, beyond all the things that parents do physically to raise their children, they must also pray for them regularly and seek God’s help to raise them correctly. Parents must also anoint and pray over their children regularly to protect them from evil forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the short time that I have spent on the earth, I have seen the enemy work all manners of evil in the lives of children. Many times, some parents heap blames on their children for lacking focus, being unserious, or being lazy when they do not succeed, especially in their academics. They get frustrated that they are spending so much money on them without good results. They may not know that there might be forces of darkness that are hindering the child’s progress. It is possible for a student to study very hard and just blank out in the examination hall. There was a case at the University of Lagos some years ago where, right in the examination hall, a young man just began to urinate non-stop. There was some pandemonium, and those around him began to call an ambulance. However, he told them that this was not the case for the doctor and that they should call his pastor instead. His pastor prayed for him, and he was healed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The anointing sets a child apart for greatness. Although David was destined to be the king of Israel, that destiny did not find expression until he was anointed. After he was anointed, the Bible says that the Spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward (1 Samuel 16:13). In the very next chapter, he killed the Philistine giant, Goliath, and became a national figure (1 Samuel 17:48- 51). If you are a parent, speak God’s counsel over your children and anoint them regularly. Let them know that they belong to God and that anyone who touches them touches the apple of God’s eye (Zechariah 2:8). I pray that God will protect every child from the attacks of the enemy, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

If this is your story, I decree your freedom today, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you notice certain negative patterns in your family that seem to be beyond anyone’s control, there is a possibility that a generational curse is in play. One thing about generational curses is that they are supervised by demons who have built a stronghold in that family. Because of how strong their hold is in the family, many members of the family ultimately give in to the curse. They see the effects of the curse as their lot, so they never try to fight against it. When Moses killed an Egyptian to save an Israelite, it was the same Israelites who condemned him and let the secret out. They had fallen in love with their oppressors even though they were suffering. They even quarrelled with Moses in the wilderness many times for setting them free. They kept talking about the food in Egypt and even the graves (Numbers 11:5, Exodus 14:11). Obviously, they had resolved to die in their negative situation; after all, it was in the same situation that their fathers died. The stronghold of the devil had eaten into their minds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have noticed a negative pattern in your family, please don’t settle into it as if it is normal. Don’t let those curses have a hold on your mind; be determined to break free from them. Your father, mother, and those older than you may have experienced it, but that doesn’t mean you must also experience it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a young man who was 39 years old and was about to turn 40. He came to me for prayers and said that no male in his family had ever exceeded 40 years of age. He said he was the oldest male in the family, and now he was about to turn 40. He was afraid that he was going to die, and that was why he came to me. We prayed, and he is still alive today, more than 30 years later. If he had not refused to become a victim of the generational curse in his family and had instead started preparing for his death, he would never have been liberated. If you have noticed any generational curses in your family, submit yourself to God today, resist the devil, and he will run far away from you (James 4:7).</p>",

      "<p>Today, I’ll conclude my discussion on generational curses and their impact. Such curses take root over several generations, and when anyone wants to remove them, they won’t go without a fight. For instance, when Moses tried to deliver Israel from the hold of the Egyptians, Pharaoh was reluctant to let them go. God had to send ten plagues before he was forced to release them. Even after that, he and his army pursued them to take them back into bondage. The Egyptians had tormented Israel for many generations – lasting 430 years (Exodus 12:40) – and they didn’t want to let them go. For Israel to finally be free, God had to wipe out Pharaoh’s soldiers (Exodus 14:27- 28). If there are any generational curses working against your destiny, I decree they are broken today, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be free from generational curses, people can go to genuine ministers of God, and they will cancel them. However, if they continue to live sinful lifestyles, the curses may come back. Imagine if, after Israel was freed, they separated themselves from Moses, their link to God, the Egyptians would have recaptured them. The primary thing that is required for generational curses to be broken forever is that people remain close to God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People can also break generational curses by themselves if they become really intimate with Christ. The literal meaning of today’s memory verse is that as you continually get filled with the Holy Spirit, you will grow in the spirit such that your neck will become too big for any demonic yoke to hold it. After Jesus healed the man at the pool of Bethesda, He warned him not to return to sin so that something worse wouldn’t happen to him (John 5:14). Sin will always keep the door open for generational curses. You must live a holy life because the devil will return to check if he has legal grounds to torment you again (John 14:30). You must also be willing to pray and fast diligently because certain demons only respond to prayer and fasting (Mark 9:29). You should also study your Bible diligently because it is the truth that makes you free (John 8:32), and do not forsake the fellowshipping of brethren because one can chase 1,000 but two can chase 10,000 (Hebrews 10:25, Deuteronomy 32:30). As you do these, no generational curse or any other curse will be able to affect you, your family, and every other thing that concerns you.</p>",

It is to allow God’s wisdom to fill your heart so you can have a deep understanding of what God’s will is and do it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Esau is an example of someone in the Bible who didn’t walk in wisdom, and this affected his future negatively. He was the firstborn son of Isaac and Rebecca, and as the firstborn, he was entitled to his father’s blessing. His future was looking very bright until one day when he went to the field to hunt for meat. He returned home hungry and met his brother, Jacob, cooking. Esau allowed his hunger to cloud his reasoning and accepted Jacob’s offer to trade his birthright for a plate of food, as we see in today’s Bible reading. He didn’t know that the birthright he carelessly sold was tied to the blessing that was waiting for him in the future. Because he despised his birthright, the blessing fled from him. You must live in such a way that you don’t eat your tomorrow today. Don’t be like Esau, who couldn’t see beyond his immediate want and allowed a temporary hunger to cause him to lose a permanent blessing.</p><p>Another fellow who didn’t walk in wisdom and allowed his foolish actions to destroy his future was Reuben. Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob, and as the firstborn, he had every right to inherit the blessing. However, he was unwise, and he slept with his father’s concubine. He allowed his temporary desire to cheat him and his descendants of the great blessing he should have inherited. When his father was about to die, instead of receiving blessings, he and his descendants inherited curses (Genesis 49:3-4).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, choose to walk in wisdom by living strictly according to the word of God at all times so that you and your children can reap good fruits in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "<p>Over the past two days, I discussed the relationship between your past and present. Today, I will conclude the series by discussing about your future and how your present will impact it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a believer, your future is secure because only God controls the past, the present, and the future – He is Alpha and Omega. This is why Colossians 1:27 says, <strong>“…Christ in you, the hope of glory:”</strong> Furthermore, Isaiah 3:10 says, “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him…” These are promises from God, assuring you that your future will be alright.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your future can be categorised into two: your future on earth and your future in eternity. If you’re a genuine Christian, you shouldn’t worry about tomorrow because God has promised to take care of you here on earth. In John 14:13, Jesus said that if you ask anything in His name, it will be given to you. He said in Matthew 7:9-11 that even in our wicked state, we humans would never give our children stones when they ask for bread, so how would we not expect Him to give us every good thing that we ask Him for? As long as you are His child, God has promised that you will lack no good thing here on earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God has also promised to take care of you when you leave the earth. In John 14:1-3, Jesus said:</p><p><i><strong>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a genuine child of God, when you leave this world, a mansion in a city made of pure gold is waiting for you in heaven (Revelation 21:18).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you haven’t given your life to Jesus Christ, you are in the kingdom of darkness, and you are courting double jeopardy. On earth, Satan will have the right to make a mess of you because you belong to his kingdom, and in eternity, you will be in the lake of fire, far away from God, who is the source of all peace, joy, and light. If you haven’t given your life to Jesus, turn to Him right now because, outside Him, your future will be terrible (Isaiah 3:11).</p>",

      "<p>The first record of God introducing Himself in person to man by His name was in Genesis 17:1, and He said, “I am Jehovah El-Shaddai.” This is often interpreted as ‘The God who is more than enough.’ However, some Bible scholars have said there is a deeper meaning to the name as it also describes God as an inexhaustible source for our nurturing. This implies that God is saying, “You can draw everything you need for growth and a fulfilling life from Me.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My God is the All-sufficient One. David said in Psalm 23:1, <strong>“The LORD is my Shepherd; I shall not want.” </strong>Philippians 4:19 says that God will supply ALL your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. The Bible says further in Philippians 4:13, <strong>“I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</strong>” These and many more Scriptures give me the assurance that if I am linked with the All-sufficient One, it is impossible for me to lack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God daily loads us with benefits (Psalm 68:19) – He gives us benefits every single day! When He wants to supply your needs for a day, He can use various methods. In 1956, I was living with an uncle in Ilesha, a town in Western Nigeria. He was a drummer whose only source of income was whenever people invited him to play the drum. When he doesn’t receive any invitations, no money comes in, and we will starve. On a particular day, both of us were hungry, and we hoped that somebody would come and invite him to drum. After a while, a girl came to us with a big bowl on her head, dropped it, and said, “My sister said I should give you this food.” My uncle said, “I don’t know your sister.” The girl replied, “Well, my sister knows you,” and she turned around and left. Immediately after she left, we opened the bowl and found pounded yam and chicken stew in it. We had been starving, so we descended on the food without delay. As we were breaking the chicken bones, the girl came back and said, “I’m sorry, I came to the wrong house,” but it was too late. When God wants to supply your needs, He can divert blessings that do not seem to be yours to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, never worry about your needs. Trust and obey the All-Sufficient One, and you will always have all you need and more.</p>",

If everywhere is totally dark, there will be no shadows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Malachi 4:2 calls Jesus the Sun of righteousness. If you read John 5:2-9, you will see the story of a man who had been sick for 38 years and had been forsaken by everybody. All of a sudden, while he lay helplessly on the ground, a shadow was cast over him. When he lifted up his eyes, he saw the Sun of righteousness. Not long after, he was on his feet and was found in the temple (John 5:14).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The madman of Gadara became free from demonic oppression when he encountered the Sun of righteousness (Mark 5:1-15). The woman with the issue of blood didn’t have any hope of healing and restoration until she came under the shadow of the Almighty. Her twelve years of pain, disappointment, and sorrow ended the moment she encountered the Sun of righteousness (Mark 5:25-34).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s memory verse, David described God as a sun and a shield. As the Sun, He drives away every darkness from your life and gives you victory and wholeness, and as the Shield, He protects you from all evil and preserves your soul. David experienced God as his sun and shield when he was running from Saul. No wonder he said in Psalm 37:40 that God will help and deliver His people from the wicked because they trust in Him. Only those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High can abide under the shadow of the Almighty and boast of this kind of deliverance (Psalm 91:1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The secret place of the Most High is a place for intimate conversations with Him; it is a place where you can build intimacy with Him. Also, in His secret place, He reveals mysteries to overcome the enemy. Elisha knew the secret conversations of the king of Syria because he had an intimate relationship with God (2 Kings 6:8-12). If you want to abide under Christ’s shadow, then you have to dwell in His secret place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, are you dwelling in the secret place of the Most High? Only those who live a holy life and prioritise spending quality time with God can dwell there. Sinners cannot dwell in the secret place; therefore, if you’re not yet born again or you’re still toying with sin, repent now and come under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>",

I was earning a good salary as a lecturer, and because I was afraid of the traffic in Lagos, I employed a driver. I would pay him his salary at the beginning of the month, but by the middle of the month, I would be borrowing money from him to buy fuel. Things were hard because Isaiah 3:11 says that God has ordained hardship for sinners. I am sure that if you go through the medical records at the University of Lagos Health Centre, you’ll see how large my medical file was because I, my wife, and our children were always getting sick. However, since I surrendered my life to God, I and my family have been healthy. By His grace, I have been healthy since 1973 to date.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stopped wasting money when I stopped sinning. Before I became born again, you would find all sorts of alcoholic drinks in my house. Whenever my colleagues came visiting, they would say, “We can’t pass in front of the palace without saying hello to the king.” They actually came to drink because I was the king of alcohol. After I became born again, they would come, and if they requested alcoholic drinks, I would say, “I’m sorry, I don’t have that anymore; I only have soft drinks.” They would get offended, and little by little, all my old friends disappeared, and God replaced them with brothers and sisters in Christ. Once you start living a holy life, things will turn around for good in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sin always takes more than people bargain for. When Joshua led the Israelites to conquer Jericho, everything went smoothly because there was no sin in their camp. However, the moment Achan took the accursed thing, Israel started experiencing defeat. The little country of Ai dealt with them so much that they had to run from the battlefield (Joshua 7:1-4). Sin brings disgrace and dishonour to sinners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is foolish to engage in sin.

He can decide to make you overflow with wealth, but He will not do it for someone who is selfish.

The Lord Jesus was overflowing with health, which is why the woman with the issue of blood simply touched the hem of His garment and was healed (Matthew 9:20-22).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, a teenager who had sickle cell anaemia and had been sick all his life stood up to give a testimony in church. He said, “I heard that Daddy G.O. is coming to this church next Sunday. I want to testify that I will be healed next Sunday.” Somebody called me to tell me the teenager’s testimony, and I started praying that God would allow me to meet him. As God would have it, the young man was standing outside as I got to the church and came out of my car. He didn’t look like a teenager at all; he looked so tiny. He came to me and said, “Daddy, I’ve been sick all my life, but I am confident that since you have come to this church today, I will be healed today.” I hugged him and said, “It will be unto you according to your faith.” I got his letter some months later, and he wrote, “Dear Daddy, I want to thank God, and I want to thank you. I have been healed since the day you came to our church.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, Jesus didn’t just die for you to be healthy; He wants your health to overflow such that any sick person you lay hands on will become healed and healthy.

Just as Peter’s shadow healed the sick (Acts 5:15) and handkerchiefs taken from Paul’s body drove out diseases from people (Acts 19:12), God wants you to overflow with health and become a channel of healing and health to others. I pray that you will live in constant health all the days of your life and that the healing anointing will flow through you to others, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

When we overflow with praise towards God, He gives us blessings that are beyond measure. When you praise God, you please Him, and when you please Him, He makes even your enemies to be at peace with you (Proverbs 16:7). No wonder David never lost a battle; his overflowing praise always made God silence all his enemies before him. When you go out of your way to praise God, He goes out of His way to shower you with abundant blessings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To really give overflowing praise to God, you cannot set limits to your praise; you have to praise Him without ceasing. This means that you keep praising Him everywhere you go and while going about your daily activities. This also means that your major preoccupation throughout all your days should be to give Him praise continually. This is why every time people see me, they notice that my mouth is always moving – I am always singing choruses to praise my God. I remember one time I travelled outside Nigeria; I went to a bookstore to buy some books. While picking the books, I was singing praises to God. A white man came into the bookstore, saw me, and made a joke about my singing. We laughed, shook hands, and as he was about to leave, he said, “Wait a minute, it is gone!” Apparently, he had been suffering from a backache for years. The moment I shook his hands in that mood of worship, the backache disappeared. If you want to experience constant miracles everywhere you go, even when you are not expecting it, then you should be giving God overflowing praise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who give God overflowing praise do not wait for Him to do anything for them before they praise Him. They praise Him in season and out of season. Just the fact that they get up from their beds in the morning is enough reason to give Him praise. In return, God ensures that He meets their needs even before they ask so that they can put more time and focus into praising Him. Before any trouble comes, He settles it so that the flow of praise does not stop. Beloved, make it a habit to praise God everywhere you go, and He will beautify your life with His abundant blessings.</p>",

      "<p>Many of God’s attributes can be seen in the Bible and one of them is that He is merciful. Today’s memory verse says that He is rich in mercy, and this means that He has more than enough for everyone; hence, He can never run out of it. The Bible also says in Psalm 62:12:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy…&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Scripture above tells us that mercy belongs to God. When something belongs to someone who loves you, you can rest assured that he or she will give you that thing anytime you need it. This means that as long as you belong to God, you will always enjoy His mercy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s Bible reading tells the story of a leper who came to Jesus and said, “If you will, you can make me clean.” In other words, he was saying, “I know you are merciful, but I don’t know if that mercy extends to me. If you will have mercy on me, then I know I will become clean.” Jesus didn’t get angry at him; He reached out to him and touched him. In those days, it was forbidden to touch a leper, but when mercy shows up for a man, it breaks human protocols. Jesus also corrected the leper’s wrong mindset. He told him, “I will; be clean.” Jesus showed him that mercy is always available to those who come to Him. God never withholds His mercy from those who cry out to Him for it. When Blind Bartimaeus cried for mercy in Mark 10:46-52, Jesus heard his cry and responded. When a father cried for mercy concerning his son who was tormented by a devil, Jesus responded and delivered the child (Matthew 17:14-18). When the Canaanite woman cried for mercy concerning her daughter, even though it wasn’t yet time for the Gentiles to experience God’s merciful gift of salvation, Jesus responded, and the girl was made whole (Matthew 15:22-28). In the name above every other name, I pray that God’s mercy will locate you and make you whole in all areas of life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God's mercy is great. Psalm 57:10 tells us that His mercy is great unto the heavens. However, as great as God’s mercy is, it is only available to those who genuinely repent of their sins, surrender their lives to Jesus, and make a commitment to living a holy life. Only those who fear God will partake of His overflowing mercy (Psalm 103:11).</p>",

      "<p>When people are filled with alcohol, they become drunk. God, however, does not want this for His children; rather, He wants them to be filled with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). On the day of Pentecost, the disciples were so full of the Holy Spirit that those who saw them thought they were drunk. In truth, they were overflowing with heavenly wine called the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drunk people don’t see things the way others do. A drunk can look at a refuse heap and see a majestic bed. Likewise, when someone is filled with the Holy Spirit, he or she can look at a crippled man and see him running about. When I moved to the campground that has now become Redemption City, my colleagues at the university thought I had gone crazy. They saw a jungle, but I was seeing a city. Now, everyone can see the city that I saw some decades ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drunk people are not in control of their actions; they do whatever the alcohol influences them to do. If it influences them to sleep on a highway, they will gladly do so without thinking of the dangers involved. Likewise, when you’re drunk with the Holy Spirit, you’re no longer in control of your life. You will go wherever He asks you to go and do whatever He asks you to do. You won’t argue with Him when He tells you to do something. I believe you haven’t been taken over by the wine of the Holy Spirit if you still struggle with obeying God’s instructions. Before Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, he could do whatever he wanted; at one time, he even denied Jesus. However, when the Holy Spirit came upon him on the day of Pentecost, he started preaching the gospel and never stopped until God called him home. One time, when some people threatened him not to speak about Jesus, he boldly responded, “We cannot but speak of the things we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:20). Despite the persecutions he faced, he refused to stop speaking about Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drunkards are never satisfied with a previous day’s drunkenness, so they return to the bottle daily. When you are filled until you overflow with the Holy Spirit, you will keep returning for more. The more He fills you, the more you will want Him, and the more of Him you have, the more your life will overflow with His miraculous power. Beloved, ask God to fill you with His Spirit every day.</p>",

Psalm 23:5 &nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David was talking about the overflow of the Holy Spirit in the Scripture above. Overflowing with the Holy Spirit and the anointing is God’s desire for all His children. In today’s Bible reading, Jesus Christ said that those who are thirsty can come to Him and drink. He said that out of their bellies will flow rivers of living water – not one river but rivers – that is a tremendous overflow of the Holy Spirit. Peter overflowed with the Holy Spirit because even his shadow healed the sick (Acts 5:14-16). Elisha also overflowed with the anointing so much that the flow continued after his death, and his bones raised the dead (2 Kings 13:20-21). There is no limit to how much of the Holy Spirit you can carry because God wants you to be filled to overflowing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, a woman shared a testimony in Dublin.

So, she attended one of our programmes but could not get to sit on the chair I sat on because it had been taken away before she got to it. She was sad, but suddenly, she had an idea, “He was standing at the pulpit preaching; there must be part of the anointing on the pulpit too.” So, she went to the pulpit and began to rub her stomach against it. She became pregnant that month, and when she delivered, she gave birth to triplets. The Holy Spirit had overflowed through me so much that there was enough power on the pulpit to make the barren fruitful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the Holy Spirit can overflow through you too. You can be so filled with the Holy Spirit that whatever you touch will carry the anointing. However, for that to happen, you must be drunk with His infilling. No matter how filled you are with the Holy Spirit, you must continually long for more. You must make it a habit to spend quality time in His presence to the point where you will stop being conscious of time. I pray that as you spend quality time in God’s presence, He will fill you to overflowing with the Holy Spirit and power.</p>",

      "<p>Over the past few days, I have been discussing being filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit. If a person can be filled, it then means there is a possibility of being empty. Talking about the possibility of emptiness brings me to the possibility of leakages. There are various ways to empty a container; one is to pour all its content out at once, and another could be to puncture the container so that the content begins to leak until it is totally drained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most times, when satan wants to attack a believer who is full of the Holy Spirit, he doesn’t launch an all-out attack. The devil is wary of the impact of the anointing; therefore, when he wants to attack such believers, he looks for subtle ways to empty them of the anointing. He looks for little cracks in their lives that he can exploit to cause them to lose the anointing gradually until they become empty – then, he strikes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Believers who toy with sin will first experience a leakage of the anointing, and if they do not repent, it will ultimately lead to death (Romans 6:23). A believer might still be functioning in the gifts of the Spirit, but if he or she is involved in secret sins, the anointing will begin to leak. The problem with leakage from a container is that the time it is discovered is usually when the remaining content has become too little to be useful or when the container is totally empty; by then, it is already late. When Samson said, “I will arise and go out as before” (Judges 16:20), he didn’t know that the anointing had departed from him. The discovery that the anointing is gone often happens when the devil has achieved his goal, and it can only take the special grace of God for the believer to be restored.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>…it is high time to awake out of sleep…let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. </strong>Romans 13:11-12 &nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have been toying with sin, this is the time to wake up. Those toying with sin are courting destruction. Nobody may know what you are doing in secret, but God knows, and you can be sure that the devil knows too. Solomon spoke about little foxes that spoil vines in today’s memory verse. If you have been committing secret sins, please deal with them now before they destroy you.</p>",

Why are You asking me to carry their burden? Kill me because I’m tired of all this.” God replied, “Since you say the burden is too much, get me 70 men, and I’ll take of the spirit on you and put it on them.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you think about the fact that the anointing upon Moses was divided by 70, you’ll realise that the new Moses was less anointed than the previous one. Because of this, not long after that, in Numbers 20:7-12, the man God Himself described as the meekest man on the earth (Numbers 12:3) erupted in anger. The anointing that had allowed him to cope for 40 years had been depleted due to his words during a time of discouragement. Discouragement can make people say things that would limit them in life and negatively impact their destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Elijah also allowed his words in a time of discouragement to put an abrupt end to his ministry. After calling down fire on Mount Carmel, Jezebel threatened him, and he fled. He became so discouraged as he ran away that he asked God to kill him. Thankfully, God didn’t fulfil his wish; instead, He sent an angel to feed him (1 Kings 19:1-8). Afterwards, however, He gave him his last assignment to anoint Jehu, Hazael, and Elisha, his replacement (1 Kings 19:15-16). His ministry ended when he allowed discouragement to make him say the wrong things. John the Baptist also got so discouraged that he began to doubt everything he had earlier declared. He had declared concerning Jesus, “Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Yet, he was the same person who sent his disciples to ask Jesus, “Are you the One to come or should we look for another?” (Luke 7:19-20). Not long after that, he was beheaded (Luke 9:7-9).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, while you cannot stop discouraging circumstances from happening, you can choose how to respond to them. Like David, you can encourage yourself in the Lord, as seen in today’s memory verse. God is able to keep you from falling (Jude 1:24). He is also able to give you a mighty turnaround, but you must put your trust in Him. He is more than able to see you through any discouraging circumstances that may come your way.</p>",

He had just won a victory, and a revival had started, but he got down from the mountain to discover that Jezebel was as unrepentant as before. However, because the anointing upon Him was now depleted, he couldn’t stand to face her, so he fled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, people do mighty things with the anointing, thinking that is all, but not long after they are done, they discover that more things that need the anointing are waiting. A fellow can raise the dead in church, and people will rejoice; however, when that fellow gets home, there may be another problem waiting to be solved with the anointing. This is why it is important to recharge your spiritual batteries as soon as possible every time you use the anointing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many pastors host programmes, and when hosting the programmes, they fast and pray. However, the moment the programme is over, they begin to feast and do not allow God to refill them with His anointing. By the following Sunday, people discover that it is not the same fellow who ministered the previous Sunday that is ministering because the anointing had been depleted and had not been refilled. Fasting and all other ways to become filled with the anointing are not to end when programmes end; they are to be a lifestyle. After periods of high spiritual activity where a lot of the anointing is used up, it is important to be refilled to at least the level that you were before, if not even higher.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must remain vigilant and sensitive at all times because you have an enemy who never takes a break.

It is not time to let your guard down; it is time to return to the secret place to recharge and refill. It is time to guard your heart with all diligence so you can remain fit and relevant for God’s next agenda. The Bible recorded many instances where Jesus retreated to refill. For example, after a major ministration in Mark 1:34, the next verse says that He retreated into a solitary place to pray. He’s our perfect model, and we must do the same to remain relevant in God’s kingdom.</p>",

      "<p>Yimportance of getting refilled with the anointing after moments of intense spiritual exercise. Another time you need to get a refill is when you are exhausted. In 1 Kings 19:5-8, when Elijah was tired, having been on the run from Jezebel, he told God to kill him. God said, “No, I don’t bury my wounded; I feed them. When they are weary, I refill them.” He gave him food to eat, and Elijah ate and fell asleep again. Interestingly, the man who said ‘kill me’ didn’t say ‘I’m not eating.’ God woke him the second time and gave him a second ration. Clearly, what he needed was rest and food to continue the journey. After eating, Elijah went in the strength of that food for forty days and nights. When you refill, you have the capacity and strength to go farther in God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, after the disciples returned from the missionary journey that Jesus sent them on, they gave Him great news about all the things the anointing did. Then, Jesus took them aside to a private place so they could rest. When virtue leaves a fellow, it has an impact on the body; if that fellow does not rest, he or she may become too weak to do more. Jesus knew this, so after performing many miracles, He would retreat to solitary places to refill, as I mentioned yesterday. He could consistently do great works because He always took time out to refill. He said that His followers would do greater works than He did (John 14:12), and this means they must also refill constantly as He did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you load a battery into a torch light and use it for one hour, you should allow it to rest for another hour so that it will last much longer, rather than using it continuously. Similarly, if you always take out time to rest appropriately, you will be able to do much more for God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not think you are indispensable such that you keep using your spiritual battery even when you know that you are exhausted. You might discover the hard way, like Elijah, that there are others who can easily take your place (I Kings 19:15-16). Find those people now and train them so that they can join you in doing some of the work. Don’t always wait until you are exhausted to get refilled, and if you are already exhausted, take a retreat now to get refilled.</p>",

      "<p>I will continue this series by discussing one more reason it Is very important to get refilled with the anointing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, the reason you need to get refilled is not that you are exhausted or the anointing has been depleted after a period of intense spiritual activity but that your flesh rose above your spirit for a moment. When you are angry, for instance, you may not hear God speak because your flesh has risen above your spirit. In such a period, you can cause some harm, as Elisha did in 2 Kings 2:23-24. Therefore, if you have been well-trained by God, the anointing will likely be dormant for that season to avoid causing a problem that you will later regret.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2 Kings 3:11-16, some kings came to meet Elisha, and he got angry with one of them. Afterwards, when he needed to prophesy, he had to call a minstrel to play so there could be a refilling. Before long, the man of God could say, “Thus saith the Lord” again. I have observed that whenever the flesh rises above the spirit, there will be a need to retreat into an atmosphere of worship. In that atmosphere, as the Lord descends on you, He will refill you again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another major route through which the flesh rises above the spirit in many ministers is in the area of overconfidence. Despite Jesus’ warning that he would deny Him, Peter felt so confident in himself that instead of praying for spiritual strength to avoid that, he told Jesus that he could never do such a thing, and he eventually denied Him (Matthew 26:69-75). Whenever you start feeling overly confident in your abilities and attributing what you have achieved to your hard work and sacrifices, the enemy is setting you up for a great fall, and you need to retreat and retrace your steps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. </strong>Proverbs 16:18</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Beloved, whenever your flesh rises above your spirit, run to God and ask for mercy, and He will graciously restore you. After Jesus’ resurrection, He went to Peter’s old place of work to refill him. He prepared a meal, fed him, and recommissioned him into the ministry (John 21:1-17). When your flesh rises above your spirit, go on a retreat and receive a fresh infilling of the anointing so that you can overcome the weaknesses of the flesh and fulfil God’s purpose for your life.</i></p>",

Today and in the next few days, I will discuss ways by which believers can be refilled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As God’s child, you must ensure that your spiritual fervency and passion for the things of God do not reduce. The word of God is a potent tool for recharging your spiritual battery, and this is why you must spend quality time studying, memorising, and meditating on the Scriptures daily.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nowadays, many Christians do not memorise Scriptures because everything is now digital. If someone needs to refer to a Bible passage, the fellow can just search for it through Google and other search engines. Once the fellow types a bit of the verse as a search term, immediately, the passage comes up on the screen. While digitisation is good, it is important to meditate on Scriptures and know some of them by heart, as this will prepare you to face anything the enemy brings your way. In Matthew 4:1-11, Jesus overcame the devil’s temptations by quoting Scriptures. There were no search engines at that time, and He didn’t need them – He knew God’s word by heart because He had meditated on them and memorised them. My Father in the Lord wasn’t formally educated, yet he knew a lot of Scriptures by heart. If he could memorise the Scriptures, so can you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In John 6:63, Jesus said that the words He speaks to us are spirit and life. Therefore, the more of His words you take in, the more spirit-filled you will be. God’s word is powerful; it is alive and sharper than any two-edged sword (Hebrews 4:12). As you fill yourself with His word, He will show you things, relationships, and places that can quickly drain your spiritual battery and puncture your faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One way to know if you are really filled with God’s word is to check your conversations. Matthew 12:34 says that it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks. If your heart is filled with God’s word, your mouth will be filled with His word too. The more you study God’s word, the more like Him you will become (2 Corinthians 3:18).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, become addicted to studying, memorising, and meditating on God’s word and you will be spiritually vibrant at all times. I pray that you will never lose your fervency and passion for the things of God, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I started a discussion about how important it is for you to recharge your spiritual battery by studying, memorising, and meditating on the word of God. Today, I’ll discuss worship as another way you can recharge your spiritual battery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people allow the choir to do the worshipping for them in church during services. I thank God for all the spirit-filled choristers around the world who lead powerful praise and worship sessions, but they cannot worship God on your behalf. You must learn to worship God yourself. In Ephesians 5:18-19, Apostle Paul says:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above Scripture implies that you should sing very often, even in your conversations with other people. Paul specifically says that you should sing hymns because they are inspired by the Holy Spirit. I thank God for the songs and choruses that we have today, but most of them fade with time. Many hymns, however, have stood the test of time; a lot of them were written hundreds of years ago, but they remain evergreen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, Jesus said that God is a Spirit, and those who worship Him must do so in spirit and in truth because the Father seeks such people to worship Him. When you are a worshipper, the Holy Spirit will seek you out. Worship means reverencing someone or something. When you worship God, you revere Him; you place Him in the highest position in your life. Everyone on earth is a worshipper; people worship one thing or the other. The way to know what a fellow worships is to check what he or she holds in high esteem. For instance, when people cannot do without checking their phones or scrolling through them, such phones have become objects of worship. When someone can do anything for money, that fellow is worshipping money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Worship also means submission. You submit to whomever or whatever you worship. When you worship God, you are submitting and surrendering your heart to Him so that He can fill it with His power and glory. When you submit to God, He comes and dwells in you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make singing praises to God and worshipping Him your lifestyle. When you engage in these spiritual acts constantly, He will fill you with His Spirit and keep your spiritual battery charged at all times.</p>",

Today, I will talk about another powerful way you can recharge your spiritual battery: praying in the Spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to talk to a man, you will connect better with him when you speak his language. The way to connect seamlessly with God is to talk to Him in His language: praying in the Spirit. I discovered early in ministry that if I spend time with God in secret, He will spend time with me in the open. If I wait upon Him before any programme, then He will show up! For example, whenever I’m preparing for the Holy Ghost Service, I make sure that I spend at least three days locked up with Him alone – away from my wife and children. I would wait on Him, praising Him and seeking His face for the programme ahead because Isaiah 40:31 says, <i><strong>“But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”</strong></i> I would spend time recharging my spiritual battery by praying in the Spirit. After I have spent many hours with Him, day and night, even before I start preaching many times, He begins to work miracles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Praying in the Spirit charges you up and helps you to remain on fire for God. Flies don’t like hot stoves. When a stove is cold, you’ll see them playing around it. However, when the stove is turned on, it becomes unapproachable for them. They won’t come near it because they can’t stand fire. When you pray in the Holy Ghost, you are setting yourself on fire, and anything linked with darkness cannot stay around you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you pray in the Spirit, you become energised, and this increases your spiritual fervency and sensitivity. As you pray in the Holy Ghost, you access mysteries in God’s heart because only the Holy Spirit knows the mysteries of God. Today’s Bible reading tells us that through the Holy Spirit, we can know the things that have been freely given to us; praying in the Spirit brings us to the understanding of these things. These mysteries will help you to stay spiritually charged up for God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make a habit of praying in the Spirit, and if you are born again but cannot pray in the Spirit, ask God for the gift today.</p>",

      "<p>As I conclude this series, I want you to know that you can also be refilled spiritually through the Holy Communion. In John 6:48-51, Jesus said, “If you eat My flesh, you are eating the bread of life.” In other words, He was saying, “The bread of life is My body.” When you eat the body of Christ, you are eating a body that is full of virtue and the anointing of the Holy Spirit; you are taking all that virtue into yourself. If you take the Holy Communion worthily, there is no way your spiritual battery won’t be recharged. When the woman with the issue of blood touched the hem of Jesus’ garment, He said that virtue had gone out of Him (Mark 5:25-34). When you eat the bread, you are eating virtue because it symbolises the body of Christ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The wine of the Holy Communion, which symbolises the blood of Jesus, contains the very life of Jesus (Leviticus 17:11). Colossians 2:9 says, <i><strong>“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” </strong></i>Therefore, taking His life into you by drinking the wine of the Holy Communion is taking in the fullness of the Godhead into yourself, provided you drink the wine worthily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In ancient Yorubaland, if traditional medicine men were consulted to heal people who were really sick and were at the point of death, they would usually ask the relatives of the dying fellow to bring his or her clothes and an effigy that represents him or her, among some other things. They would then wear the fellow’s clothes on the effigy and take it to the centre of the town very late at night. If someone else sees the effigy as he or she is passing by, the sick fellow would live, and the one who saw the effigy will die. The elders would say that the life of the fellow who came out at night to see what he or she shouldn’t have seen has been substituted for the life of the dying fellow. This is an attempt of the devil to copy God’s principle of substitution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you take the Holy Communion worthily, your weaknesses are taken away, and you receive the strength of Christ. You receive His life and substitute all your weaknesses for His unending, limitless power. Eat the flesh of Jesus and drink His blood regularly; He will recharge your spiritual battery and provide you with the strength and power to fulfil His purpose for your life.</p>",

      "<p>For a few days now, I have been discussing being filled with the anointing. Today, I will discuss the degrees to which you can be filled with the anointing and how charged your spiritual battery can be. As Christians, we all have the Holy Spirit, but one fellow can be filled with the anointing to a higher degree than another. This is why different Christians have different levels of authority in the Spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To fully understand how a Christian can be filled with more of the anointing than others, I’ll discuss demonic possession first because demons are spirits. In Mark 1:23- 24, the man Jesus found in the synagogue had only one unclean spirit – one demon is enough to cause so much havoc. In Luke 8:1-3, Mary Magdalene was said to have been delivered from seven demons; therefore, a man with one demon is possessed, and a fellow with seven is more possessed. When you read Matthew 12:43-45, you will see that if someone has one demon to start with, he or she could end up with eight because Jesus said that if an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it goes about looking for where to rest. If it can’t find any, it will return to its former house; if it finds the place empty, it will invite seven other demons inside to live with it such that the state of the possessed person will become worse. Also, when you read Mark 5:1-15, you will see the enormous capacity of the human soul to absorb spirits. The madman of Gadara had a legion of demons, which Bible scholars say is equivalent to as many as 6,000 demons. If a man can have 6,000 demons, then there is enough space in you to also absorb quite a lot of the anointing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s Bible reading shows us that it is possible for a Christian to go deeper and deeper in God. There is always more in God for those who remain spiritually hungry. For every thousand cubits travelled in the spirit, there is still a lot more distance that can be covered. For every spiritual height attained, there is still much more that can be attained. This is why you must remain hungry because God only fills and satisfies hungry people (Matthew 5:6, Isaiah 44:3). I pray that God will fill you with more and more of His anointing every day, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will continue my discussion about being filled with the anointing in various levels and degrees. The fact that a believer’s spiritual battery is very full today does not mean that it cannot still be fuller. There is actually no limit to how full your spiritual battery can be. 1 Corinthians 12:31 says that you should covet earnestly the best gifts. You must be very covetous when it comes to being filled with the anointing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you read 2 Kings 1:9-12, where Elijah called down fire to burn two sets of soldiers when they came to arrest him, you will know that he was full of the anointing. However, by the time you get to 2 Kings 2:9-15, Elisha told Elijah, “I want more than you have, sir.” Elijah was so full of the anointing that he could call down fire from heaven any time he wanted and shut the heavens so it would not rain for more than three years, yet Elisha wanted a double portion of that same spirit – and he got it! You also can receive more of the anointing than your spiritual leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you can be filled with the anointing to higher and higher degrees. Colossians 2:9 tells us that the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Jesus. Jesus was really full of the Holy Spirit, yet He constantly separated Himself to get more of the anointing (Matthew 14:23). Anytime He performed a special miracle, He would quickly separate Himself to get more. The One who carried the fullness of the Godhead bodily constantly went apart to get more and more. One of the major reasons many ministers of God rise and fall is that as soon as they get to a certain height, they stop getting filled. They stop studying their Bibles like before and reduce their prayer times because they now have busy schedules. Every athlete knows that he or she must work hard to become a champion. However, to remain a champion, he or she must work even harder. This is the secret to continuous growth in God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As long as you remain thirsty for more, God will pour more into you. When Elisha told the woman in today’s Bible reading to borrow vessels, the oil kept pouring as long as there were empty vessels remaining. The more you yield to God, the more He will pour His anointing into you and make you a wonder to the world.</p>",

For example, the pressure in the tyre of a bicycle differs from that of a car. Both tyres are filled with air, but more air is pumped into a car’s tyre than into a bicycle’s tyre. This is because the weight that the tyre of a car supports is more than what the tyre of a bicycle supports. The tyres of an aeroplane are just about the same size as those of a large truck; however, the pressure inside them is different. This is because an aeroplane is much heavier, and when it lands, its tyres must be able to withstand its weight. If the air pressure in an aeroplane’s tyre is lowered to that of a truck, the plane will crash as it lands.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How much you want to accomplish for God will determine how much of His anointing you will seek to be filled with. This is not about titles now, but about the real impact you want to have for God on the earth. The things a believer will accomplish for God are not dependent on church titles. Some bishops cannot deliver a small town from the devil’s hands, whereas some believers without any title can turn an entire country upside down for God. When it comes to accomplishing great and mighty things in God’s kingdom, what really matters is how much of the anointing a believer carries. God cannot perform mighty miracles or deliver communities and countries from powerful dark forces through believers who only carry low levels of the anointing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. </strong>John 14:12</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to perform greater works as Jesus said, then you must be filled with the anointing to a very great degree.

This is why, as good as technology is, parents cannot depend on it solely when it comes to raising their children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was younger and there were no computers nor access to calculators, people had to do arithmetic by themselves. Nowadays, a lot of the younger generation cannot even calculate how much they are going to pay at a counter unless they use a calculator. If you are a parent, train your children not to overly rely on technology. Train them to do some things by themselves, and this will further enhance their natural abilities. These days, some children find it very difficult to relate properly with people they meet physically because they have become addicted to relating with people online. Also, some young children do not greet other people because they are always wearing headphones and engaging with their electronic devices. You must not allow technology to make your children socially deficient or emotionally handicapped. You must ensure that you encourage them to develop their natural gifts and talents while also teaching them to interact properly with the world around them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is really sad that some children are bullied online and are plunged into depression because of what someone online said to them. Parents must be vigilant. They shouldn’t depend on technology to keep their children occupied when they don’t want to be bothered; they just might be handing them over to the devil. Don’t delegate your children’s training and upbringing to technology. If you don’t know what your children are doing on their electronic devices at every instance, then you are depending on technology to train them for you, and trust me, technology was not developed to be a godly parent. Today’s memory verse says that you should train a child in the way he or she should go. Do the apps your children engage with daily know the way they should go?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parents, spend time with your children and train them yourself.

      "<p>Many things in life have two sides or distinct opposites, just like the sides of a coin. For example, there is the sun and the moon, male and female, etc. God Himself has two sides. 1 John 4:8 says that He is Love; however, Hebrews 12:29 also says that He is a Consuming Fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is a wonder; many things about Him attest to this. He is a lamb, and He is a lion. When you talk of a lamb, you immediately think of a tiny little sheep that is so beautiful that you want to hug it, but when you talk of a lion, that is an animal that people do not usually mess around with. The Bible also calls God a sun and a shield (Psalm 84:11). While the sun can be so hot that people run away from it, a shield protects people and makes them safe. We also know God as the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 1:8). He is the beginning and the end, the first and the last (Revelation 22:13). While He is starting some things, He is putting an end to some others. He is the One who blesses a family with a newborn baby and stands faithfully by the side of a believer who is taking his or her last breath. The same God who is merciful (Psalm 103:8) is also terrible (Deuteronomy 7:21). Our God is unfathomable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In your relationship with God, there are also two sides: God’s side and your side. As you work out your salvation with fear and trembling, He works in you to do His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13). If you say that because He is working in you, then you can continue to sin, expecting grace to abound, He will forbid that (Romans 6:1-2). Yes, He wants you to be with Him in a mansion in heaven (John 14:2-3), but if you don’t play your part to get to that mansion, you will end up in hell. I agree that Jesus Christ brought grace (John 1:17), but that same verse says that He brought truth along with it. If you reject His truth, which sanctifies you and keeps you holy (John 17:17), then you will not enjoy His grace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the side of God you see and experience will depend on your actions and inactions. Walk in His truth and obey His commandments, and you will experience His favour and mercy abundantly in your life.</p>",

Our God is a very big God, yet He can make Himself so small that He can dwell in your heart. 1 John 4:4 says that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world. God is so big that He can solve any problem just by speaking a word. When He speaks a word to you, your life will never be the same again. No person, problem, or situation is as big as the Most High God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>n 1987, one of our pastors had an extraordinary experience. He was a soap maker, and one Saturday, because he wasn’t going to be working on Sunday, he decided to make preparations towards work on Monday while everyone else at his workplace had gone home. As he was mixing some chemicals, he fell, and a bowl of acid fell on his face. He cried out in great pain as the acid burned his face and eyes, but nobody was around to help him. Finally, somebody who was passing by the factory saw the door open, went in, and saw him on the ground, groaning in pain. He was rushed to the hospital, and after the doctors attended to him and treated his face, they told him that he had lost his eyes and would never see again. He said, \"Oh, that's the doctors’ report. Take me to the Redemption Camp. Let me go and hear Jesus’ report.” When they brought him to me, my faith was honestly shaken just by looking at him. However, we serve a very big God who is not moved by the things that move men; with Him, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26). I began to pray, “Father, there is nothing You cannot do. Heal the eyes of your child. Give him brand new eyes.” Today, the man the doctors said would never see again not t only sees but also reads the Bible without eyeglasses!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, no matter how terrible some of the circumstances in your life might be, don’t despair. Present them to our very big God because He is more than able to handle them. I pray that God will show Himself big in your life and turn any negative situation that may exist in your life around for good, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>A few weeks ago, I mentioned in this devotional that if it is possible to be filled with the Holy Spirit, it is also possible to be empty. The Lord, however, does not want His children to be empty. In 1 Samuel 16:1, God told Samuel, “Arise, fill thy horn with oil,” meaning that the horn was empty and needed to be filled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Samuel 16:14, after David had been anointed as king, the Spirit of God departed from Saul, and because nature abhors a vacuum, an evil spirit took over. Being empty of the Holy Spirit is a dangerous state; therefore, you must avoid anything that can lead to that. I pray that you will never be empty of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, something happened at Ijebu-Ode, a town in Ogun State, Nigeria. There was a little misunderstanding between our parish members over there and some occultic people, and the latter decided to put shigidi (a crude figurine used by the occult to invoke an evil spirit to cause havoc on their targets) in front of the parish. When it was discovered, one of my spiritual sons destroyed it with a cutlass. If he had been empty spiritually, he might have died immediately. The occultic people then decided to come to the church for a physical confrontation. When one of them entered the church, he took a step forward and staggered. On taking another step, he fell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the devil is roaming about, looking for whom to devour (1 Peter 5:8). So as not to be his victim, you must always be full of the Holy Spirit. No matter how hard he tries, you will always win against him if you're always filled with the Holy Spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The seven sons of Sceva in today’s Bible reading were empty fellows. They wanted to cast out a demon and thought they would succeed just by commanding it to leave in the name of Jesus, whom Paul preached. They went before the demon\u0002possessed man empty and were disgraced. People who think they can replicate good results without paying the necessary price always get themselves into trouble. Being empty of God’s power and presence is a dangerous state to be in because evil spirits are always looking for empty places to dwell (Matthew 12:43-45).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t give place to the devil (Ephesians 4:27); don’t allow evil spirits to take over your vessel. Ensure you always remain filled with the Holy Spirit so you can always walk in victory.</p>",

God is such a wonder that the Bible calls Him Wonderful (Isaiah 9:6).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I was travelling from Ibadan to Ilorin within Western Nigeria, and there was this narrow bridge along the way that couldn't contain two vehicles driving side by side at the same time. There was a sign which read, ‘Narrow Bridge Ahead,’ so that when drivers approached the bridge and saw another vehicle on the bridge coming in the opposite direction, they could wait for the vehicle to pass through. On this day, my driver and I were already on the bridge, and a trailer was coming from the other side at great speed. The driver was supposed to stop for us to pass to the other side, but for unknown reasons, he didn’t. We were headed for a collision, and there was no time to pray; we could only shout, “Jesus!” We met in the middle of the bridge, and somehow, the vehicles passed by each other. When we got to the other side, my driver was shaking like a jellyfish as he parked the car. If he had looked behind him, he would have noticed I was shaking even more than he was. When he regained his composure, I had also regained mine a bit. He turned to me and asked, “Daddy, what happened?” I replied, “God enlarged the bridge.” Throughout the rest of our journey, he kept saying, “Wonderful!” and I told him, “That’s His name.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything about God is wonderful. His works are wonderful (Psalm 107:8) – He created the heavens and the earth in just six days! Psalm 40:5 also tells us that many are His wonderful works, and they cannot be numbered. His testimonies are also wonderful (Psalm 119:129) – He parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-22) and caused the formidable walls of Jericho to crumble on their own (Joshua 6:20). His knowledge is wonderful (Psalm 139:6). His counsel is also wonderful (Isaiah 28:29) – you can never find a greater or better adviser than the Almighty God. Even when His counsel appears foolish to the human mind, it is infinitely wiser than the wisdom of men (1 Corinthians 1:25).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My wonderful God does great wonders. I pray for you today; you will experience His wonders before this year ends. When Lazarus came back to life after four days in the grave, it was a wonder. My wonderful God will visit every dead matter in your life and cause you to experience great wonders, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

He does wonders.” Moses and the Israelites sang the words in today’s memory verse to testify of God’s wonders after He delivered them from the Egyptians. They had been camped before the Red Sea, and the mighty Egyptian army came in pursuit of them to take them back into slavery. They had nowhere to go, but God instructed Moses to lift his rod over the sea, and suddenly, it parted for them to walk through to the other side on dry ground. They got to the other side and looked behind them to see the Egyptian army, who had pursued them into the midst of the sea, drowning in the same waters that parted for them. If you were there on that day, you would not need to be told that God is indeed a God of wonders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God does things that make people marvel. I once travelled abroad, and when I landed at the airport, I didn’t see a particular son of mine whom I was so sure would be among those who came to welcome me. I asked about him and was told that he was dying at a hospital. I said, “Let’s stop by the hospital.” When we got there, we were led into a room where terminally ill patients – those whom the doctors had labelled as ‘sure to die’ – were kept. Patients who go into that room usually don’t come out alive. My son had a PSA (something in the body that doctors use to diagnose cancer) over 4,000! The normal PSA in a man’s body is supposed to be less than 10. When it approaches 100, the doctors suspect cancer, and when it gets to 300, the cancer is diagnosed as terminal. In that country, you are not allowed to pray for anybody who doesn’t request your prayers, so even though there were many people in that room with my son, I prayed for only him and left. It was on a Saturday, and by Wednesday, he had been discharged from the hospital. However, the greater wonder was that everybody in that room when I went in there was also discharged on the same day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you’re reading this and the world has concluded that there is no hope for you concerning some situations in your life, the God of wonders will surprise them, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

For example, in 1 Kings 17:8-16, there was a widow who had only one meal left. God paid her a visit, and that final meal lasted another three years. In 2 Kings 4:1-7, there was another widow who had only one pot of oil. The Lord moved in her situation, and the oil kept multiplying until there was enough to sell to pay all her debts and live on for her lifetime. If you’ve seen God do something you desire for somebody, take that as an assurance that He can do the same for you. When you come across an account of a kind of miracle that you desire in the Scriptures, rejoice because your own miracle is on its way. As long as they’re His children, God isn’t partial to anyone or any type of people; all that matters to Him is that you believe, because all things are possible to those who believe (Mark 9:23). God is a God of principles, and anyone who follows His principles and has faith in Him will experience His goodness and power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus couldn’t do many mighty works in His hometown because of the people’s unbelief (Matthew 13:58). Even though they were His townspeople, as long as they didn’t have faith, they couldn’t receive miracles. Unbelief closed the doors of miracles to them, and Jesus, who had the Holy Spirit without measure (John 3:34), could only heal a few sick people (Mark 6:5). No matter how close you think you are to God, if you harbour unbelief, you may limit what He can do in your life and through you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When someone has faith, regardless of the fellow’s nationality, ability, or status, he or she will experience great miracles. When Jesus was on earth, while some Jews were dying in their sicknesses because of their unbelief, some Gentiles were receiving jaw-dropping miracles. The Centurion in today’s Bible reading is an example of a Gentile whose faith attracted miracles. He understood that distance isn’t a barrier when faith is present, and Jesus was amazed at his great faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have faith in God concerning a miracle you’ve seen or read about, God is able to replicate the same in your life. It doesn’t matter how terrible your situation is or the obstacles that surround you; if you believe, you will see God’s glory at work (John 11:40).</p>",

When you hear that a grown-up man was born lame, you know that it is a long-standing problem that no one has been able to solve. As Peter and John were about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms. Peter said, “Silver and gold, I have not, but I will give you what I have.” Then, he said, “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” Suddenly, the man who had never walked all his life began to walk and jump and praise God. The Bible says that when he entered the temple, everybody looked at him in amazement because they all knew he had been lame since birth, and none of them had imagined that there was a solution to his problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Mark 5:2-19, we read of a madman who was living in a graveyard. He had been mad for a while, and everybody knew him; he seemed to be a hopeless case. Then, he encountered Jesus Christ, and with just one word, he was set free. When the people in the region came and saw the man who used to be mad, sitting, well-dressed, and in his right mind, they were afraid. The Everlasting Solution came on the scene and solved the man’s long-standing madness instantly. Likewise, in John 5:1-9, there was a man who had an infirmity for thirty-eight years. This man had a permanent spot by the Pool of Bethesda, and every time the angel came to stir the water, he missed his opportunity to be healed. However, when his long-standing problem encountered the Everlasting Solution, it disappeared immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you have been encountering problems that have lingered for a long time, Jesus is all you need. He is the Everlasting Solution to every ancient problem, and He is willing and able to put an end to all the problems you might be facing once you have genuinely submitted your life to Him.</p>",

One day, one of her husband’s relatives told her to stop wasting her time because some witches had taken her womb, and she could never bear a child. She came to a Holy Ghost Service, and God spoke, “There is someone here; you have just been told that you have no womb. Don’t worry because I will give you a set of twins.” Not long after that, she became pregnant. At the hospital, a doctor examined her and said, “It looks like there is a child here.” She replied, “No, it’s not one child; God promised to give me a set of twins.” The doctor said, “You should be thanking God that there is even one.” She went back for another test about three months later, and the doctor said, “There are two babies here.” When the time came for her to deliver, she was flown to one of the best hospitals abroad, and she requested a Caesarean Section. After bringing the babies out, the surgeon searched and could not find a womb inside the woman. When she came around after the anaesthetics she was given wore off, the surgeon came to her and said, “I have performed more than 3,000 operations. This is the first time I am bringing a set of twins out of a woman who has no womb.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible. </strong>Mark 10:27</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, no matter what anybody has said about the negative situations that might exist in your life, your case is not hopeless.

      "<p>Paul persecuted Christians and threw some of them in prison (Acts 8:3). He considered himself the chief of sinners (1 Timothy 1:15); however, God transformed him and began to use him to perform special miracles (Acts 19:11-12). If God could use Paul, He can use you too. Acts 5:14-16 tells us that people laid the sick on the streets of Jerusalem so that whenever Peter was passing by, his shadow would fall on them, and they would be healed. This was the same Peter who denied Jesus three times, but God restored him and began to use him mightily. If God could use Peter, He can use you too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We were having a Holy Ghost Service at Redemption City when a woman got a phone call that her daughter had given birth to a set of twins, and she and the twins had died. The woman responded, “Don't move them yet; please wait for me.” She ran to the hospital and asked to see the twins – she was shown their dead bodies. She took a bottle of oil and a handkerchief we had prayed over during the service, dropped some of the oil in the mouth of one of the dead twins, and said, “Come back here; who told you that you could die?” Within a few minutes, the baby coughed and came back to life. She did the same with the second baby, and the same thing happened. After this, the entire hospital was in pandemonium. Around that time, her daughter's body was being wheeled to the mortuary. She told those wheeling the body to stop, dropped some oil in her dead daughter's mouth, put the handkerchief on her, and said, “Who do you think is going to take care of your children? Don't waste my time; come back!” Immediately, her daughter came back to life and sat up. God used her to bring three people back to life in one day. Beloved, God can use you to perform miracles too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today's Bible reading says that these signs shall follow them that believe: they shall cast out devils, speak with new tongues, lay hands on the sick, and bring healing to them by using the name of Jesus. If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, you are the perfect candidate for God to use to perform signs and wonders. Be confident of His ability in you, and He will do great and marvellous things through you in the mighty name of Jesus.</p>",

Whenever demons tormented Saul and David played the harp, God’s presence would fill the room, and the demons would run away (1 Samuel 16:23). Psalm 22:3 says that God inhabits the praises of Israel. When you praise God regularly, demons cannot stay around you because once light comes in, darkness must flee (John 1:5).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must learn to praise God daily. In the Scriptures, you’ll find many reasons to praise Him. In Genesis 17:1, God calls Himself Jehovah Elshaddai, the God who is more than enough. In Genesis 18:9-14 and Jeremiah 32:27, He is revealed as the God of all flesh, with whom nothing is impossible. In Exodus 15:26, He introduced Himself as “…the Lord that healeth thee” because He is the Great Physician. In Psalm 24:7-10, He introduced Himself by two titles: The King of glory and the Lord of hosts. In Psalm 23:1, He presents Himself as Jehovah Rohi, the Good Shepherd who provides everything you need. In Genesis 16:13, He is El-Roi, the All-seeing, All-knowing, ever\u0002attentive God. He cares intimately about you and knows you by name (Exodus 33:17). In Jeremiah 32:17-19, He is El Gibhor, the mighty God who rescues. In Exodus 17:15, He is called Jehovah Nissi, your mighty banner of deliverance. In Isaiah 1:24, He is Jehovah Sabaoth, the Lord of hosts; He fights visible and invisible battles on your behalf and gives you victory over the enemy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Ezekiel 48:35, He is Jehovah Shammah, the ever-present One. He is always there when you need Him, and He never slumbers or sleeps (Psalm 121:4). He is the Alpha and Omega of your life (Revelation 21:6); He always has the first and final say (Isaiah 44:6). He alone is God (Psalm 86:10); He is always good (Psalm 73:1), ever faithful (Lamentations 3:23), all-sufficient (Genesis 17:1), and never changing (Malachi 3:6). God is your comforter (John 14:16), deliverer (2 Samuel 22:2), helper (Psalm 54:4), teacher (John 14:26), strength, and song (Exodus 15:2). He is your very present help in trouble (Psalm 46:1). He supplies all your needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19) and does exceeding, abundantly above all you can ask or think (Ephesians 3:20). He saved you and will keep you until the end (Jude 1:24).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you have breath in you; therefore, you have every reason to praise God.</p>",

      "<p>People keep asking why The Redeemed Christian Church of God is so successful all over the world. As a matter of fact, we are in some nations where Christianity is not allowed. In some of these nations, we baptise people secretly, and whenever we want to talk about the blood of Jesus, we say BOJ. We have had considerable impact in some of these nations because we did not allow anything deter us from spreading the gospel. We hold Bible Study meetings in open fields and miracles happen. Sometimes, the political leaders in such places come quietly at night, acknowledging that our God is the Almighty.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was once a lady evangelist and missionary who was working in a village in Africa. In that village, she got everybody to become born again. The people realised what God had done for them, and they were on fire for Him. The lady then decided to convert those in the neighbouring village too. She informed the people around her about her plans, but they were not in favour of it. “You can go to another village, ma’am, not there,” they advised. She asked, “Why not?” They replied, “Because there are lions on the way. We have been hearing them roaring, and when they roar like that, it means they are hungry. Please, don’t go near that village.” “But I must go,” she insisted. So, a very elderly and feeble man said to her, “Okay, if you must go, I will go with you.” The evangelist looked at him and said, “If a lion attacks, even I can defend myself better than you can.” The man said, “You don’t understand; lions don’t attack when they are full. They only kill when they are hungry. So, the idea is this: I will walk ahead of you, the lions will kill and eat me, and then your way will be clear.” Those villagers were ready to lay down their lives for the gospel to reach the unreached.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God will not be asking you for too much by telling you to preach to your boss, for instance. However, if you are afraid you might lose your job and refuse to do it, you will be hindering an unsaved soul from hearing the gospel and becoming saved. Do not let any barrier keep you from preaching the gospel; God is counting on you to prevent many people from heading towards eternal damnation.</p>",

      '<p>Years ago, some Christian students in a particular university came to me and said, “We don’t know what is going on. Those of us who are in the fellowship are always the ones failing.” I replied to them, “This might be because, at the time you are supposed to be studying, you are in the fellowship.” They said, “Is it not written that the Holy Spirit will help us?” I responded, “Thank God for the Holy Spirit, but the Bible says that the Holy Spirit will remind you of the things you have learnt. However, if you do not learn anything and end up failing, after He chastises you, He will comfort you.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, to walk in God’s blessings, faith must go hand-in-hand with works. For example, in Luke 5:1-9, Jesus came to Peter, who had a boat and asked him to lend Him the boat for a while. After preaching from the boat, Jesus told Peter to cast his net into the sea for a catch. If Peter had not cast his net, he would not have seen the glory of God. If he had just said, “I believe you, Jesus. I know You can do all things,” and had refused to obey the simple instruction, he would have returned home empty-handed that night. Instead, he said, "At thy word – because You have spoken to me – I will do what You say." He took a step of faith and did the work of throwing his net into the sea. Then, he caught so many fishes that his net broke. People who add works to their faith experience ‘net-breaking’ miracles. Another example of someone in the Bible who added works to their faith is the woman with the issue of blood in Luke 8:43-48. She did not just stop at knowing that Jesus carried the healing anointing, she forced her way through a large crowd just to touch the hem of His garment. The result was that she was instantly healed of a sickness she had suffered from for 12 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not doing anything in line with the faith you claim to have, that faith is dead. You cannot sit in your house and pray for a job when you are not applying for any. Likewise, you cannot be trusting God for a visa to another country when you do not even have an international passport. Bring your faith to life by adding works to it; faith without works is dead.</p>',

If you want to be successful, then you must be diligent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I and one of my friends got born again at a time when making positive confessions was becoming popular among Christians. At that time, the popular teaching was, ‘All you need to do is to say what you want repeatedly, and it will be yours.’ This friend of mine was very diligent with making these positive confessions. He would wake up in the morning and say, “I have a brand new car, in the mighty name of Jesus.” Five years later, he was yet to own a car. One day, he asked me, “What’s your secret? I’ve been making positive confessions without tangible results.” I replied, “You wake up at 10 am in the morning, and at that time, I would have already put in five hours of work. Also, instead of working, you start making confessions. I’m sorry, but you will keep walking everywhere you go for a long time to come if you don’t change.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some people have become so attached to motivational speaking. They are usually the first to register for conferences; however, when it is time to put in the work, they are often nowhere to be found. No amount of confessions or unapplied knowledge can turn a lazy fellow into a high flyer. A fellow who doesn’t wake up every day to make positive confessions or listen to smooth-talking motivational speakers will still succeed if he or she knows how to work hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although I’m in my 80s, I still go about doing God’s work diligently. When many other people are sleeping, I am walking about at night, praying. I don’t preach shallow sermons; if you listen to my sermons, you will notice that I make reference to many Bible passages. These things don’t come by just loafing around. Success in life is not automatic; being born a prince or princess does not mean that a fellow will succeed in life. No matter how much wealth a fellow inherits, if he or she is lazy and refuses to put in the work to multiply the wealth, that fellow will eventually squander everything and begin to suffer. Proverbs 18:9 says that a lazy person is a brother to him who is a great waster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, laziness will make you waste privileges. It will also make you unprepared to maximise opportunities. Do not give laziness a chance; banish it from every area of your life.</p>",

A wilderness is often characterised by a lack of food and water, and even though David might have been hungry and thirsty, he expressed a much greater desire for something more than food and water – God’s presence. No wonder God called David a man after His own heart (Acts 13:22).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, we read about the Ethiopian eunuch who had travelled many miles to Jerusalem to worship God. However, he had many questions as he was returning to his home country. As he travelled on the dusty roads of Gaza, an angel spoke to Phillip and told him to position himself on the road the eunuch was travelling on. As Phillip stood by the road, the Holy Spirit gave him an additional instruction to move closer to the man’s chariot. God was so interested in the eunuch that He moved everything – an angel, a man, and His Spirit – to give him the answers he desired (Acts 8:26-40). This is what happens when God sees genuine hunger for Him in the life of a fellow. He will never let the hungry go away without being filled, and He will always fill them with good things (Luke 1:53).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. </strong></i>Matthew 5:6</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God feeds you in proportion to your hunger for Him. Psalm 42:7 says, <strong>“…deep calleth unto deep...”</strong> When you really want to go deep in God, your hunger will attract the resources you need to go deep. A hungry and thirsty fellow is one who is desperate for food and water. In the same vein, God expects us to hunger and thirst for His power and glory. He expects us to desperately pursue Him and seek intimacy with Him. Jesus gave a parable in Matthew 13:44-46 that the Kingdom of God is like a man who found treasure in a field and sold all that he had so he could buy that field and own the treasure. Just like that man in the parable, God wants you to be hungry for Him so you can be filled and reflect more of His glory on the earth.</p>",

This is because when light is present, it becomes easy to put every other thing in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, a blind beggar called Bartimaeus was crying desperately for the attention of Jesus Christ. He was living in the bondage of poverty and was likely a lonely man who had nobody to help him. His case seemed to be a hopeless one simply because he could not see. When Jesus asked him what he wanted, he asked for the ability to see. He could have asked for money and clothes, but all he asked for was the ability to see light. Your ability to see, including physically and spiritually, is far more beneficial than money and clothes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God’s light comes, every form of darkness and sorrow disappears. The question now is, how can you let the light of God into your life? Jesus said in John 8:12 that He is the Light of the world. If you let Jesus into your life, His light will shine in you and chase out every form of darkness. He will shine so much in you that you will begin to shine on others. This is why He said in Matthew 5:14 that you are the light of the world. Through you, darkness will leave your family, and everyone who comes in contact with you will benefit from the light you carry. Before I became born again, there were curses and sorrows in the Adeboye family. However, after the Light – Jesus Christ – came into my life, every generational curse was broken. Poverty and sorrows were also banished forever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</strong></i> 2 Corinthians 5:17</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, no matter how potent the generational curses or forces of darkness that might be holding you back are, once you surrender your life to Jesus Christ, all things will become new and His light will drive darkness away from you. If you are, however, not yet born again, please say the following prayer:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lord Jesus, I acknowledge that I have been living in darkness. Now, I am ready for Your light. Please, come into my life and make me a new creature in You. I denounce every sin I used to commit (mention all), and I accept You as my Lord and Saviour. Thank You, Jesus.</p>",

On Saturday morning, as soon as the programme was over, he went straight to the hospital where the surgery to remove his kidney was done and asked the surgeon to examine him. The surgeon said, “I remember your case; the day we were removing your kidney, everything went wrong. The surgery that was supposed to take less than an hour lasted eight hours.” When the surgeons examined him, they found two brand-new kidneys. When God, who is the God of hope (Romans 15:13), steps into a case, that case changes its status from ‘hopeless’ to ‘testimony’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God gives victory over hopelessness. For example, in Genesis 18:9-14, when He told Abraham that Sarah would have a son in nine months, Sarah laughed because she thought the situation was hopeless. However, the Almighty God, who could have said, “Because you laughed, I cancel what I have said,” did not change his mind. Instead, He said, “You can laugh as much as you like, but Isaac will be born.” Beloved, if you have considered your situation as hopeless before now, I have good news for you today. In the name that is above every other name, your Isaac will be born.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no hopeless case with God. Jeremiah 32:27 says,<strong> “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?”</strong> In Ezekiel 37:1-10 the Bible tells us that the Almighty God caused dry bones to live again. They were not just dead bodies; they were very dry bones. Yet, the Lord God caused His servant to prophesy, and the dry bones came back to life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the God who made dry bones to live again can take care of your situation. Men may have written you off, but with God, nothing is impossible (Luke 1:37).</p>",

      "<p>Today’s memory verse says that where there is no vision, the people perish. The rich fool in Luke 12:15-21 died because he told his soul to rest and pursue nothing. A lack of vision kills; when you’re pursuing a goal, your youth is renewed with each passing day. Sometime ago, I told some of my older friends that we are not old men because Joel 2:28 says that the old men shall dream dreams while the young ones will see visions. Since my older friends and I still have visions that we are pursuing, we are young.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is not enough to have a vision; you must also pursue it. Some people can talk so passionately about their vision today, but when you see them again three years from now, you will discover that they are still talking about the vision but have not taken any step to fulfil it. If you ask them why, they will give all sorts of excuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who have a vision they truly believe in don’t let anything stand in their way. Obstacles tremble when a man of vision approaches them. When God gave us the vision of the RCCG campground, we did not have the money, but that did not stop us from taking steps towards getting the land. We overcame that obstacle, and not long after that, another obstacle arose: there was no water in the camp that could support thousands of people. That also did not deter us, and we kept forging ahead. Before long, we had more than enough water. The reason many people haven’t seen their visions come to pass is that they are not doing anything to fulfil them. To fulfil a vision, you have to make moves first, and when you do, God will carry you towards the vision. Only a fellow who pursues his or her vision will hear it speak. When God spoke to Habakkuk in today’s Bible reading, He instructed him to write the vision so that at the appointed time, it would speak. When you start taking steps in the direction of the vision God has given you, your vision will speak, and many will hear it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Has God shown you something? Get to work; don’t give room for excuses. God wants to give your vision a voice that can speak life to nations, but until you do something about what you have seen, your vision will remain silent.</p>",

      "<p>I believe that humans have three kinds of eyes: physical eyes, mental eyes, and spiritual eyes. Over the next few days, I will discuss these kinds of eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your physical eyes are the two eyes that you use to see physical objects and the world around you. According to today’s Bible reading, they are the light of the body and are so important that Jesus restored the sight of every blind person that came to Him asking for sight during His earthly ministry. In Bartimaeus’ case, He spoke His word, and that word supplied two brand-new eyes (Mark 10:46-52). In the case of the man in John 9:1-7, He released His anointing into ordinary mud, and from that mud, He created two brand-new eyes. In Mark 8:22-26, He touched a man who was blind twice. The first time He touched him, the man said that he could see men looking like trees. This wasn’t good enough for Jesus, so He touched him again. When you go through the Scriptures, you will discover that instance was the only time Jesus touched anybody for their healing twice. I am sure Jesus did this to show the importance of the physical eyes. If anyone reading this devotional has problems with their physical eyes, I decree that God will touch such a person today, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since your physical eyes are the light of your body, what you see with them will determine the state of your body. If you want your body to be full of light, you will not look at things that come from the kingdom of darkness. You won’t watch certain movies or view certain pictures as they can quench the light in you and make you live in darkness. The devil is after your eyes because he knows that if he can darken them, he has succeeded in darkening your body, which is the temple of the Lord. Don’t let him succeed; look away from things that can bring darkness. Flee from every appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samson was greatly helped by God, and God used him to achieve mighty things. However, the moment he began to fix his gaze on the wrong things, he opened himself to the enemy’s attack. The enemy removed his eyes, and he was plunged into darkness because he became careless with his eyes (Judges 14-16). Beloved, be careful of what you fix your gaze on, and don’t give the enemy a chance to plunge you into darkness.</p>",

And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

Elijah replied, “Your request will be granted if you can see me when I am being taken away from you.” What he actually meant was, “If your spiritual eyes can be opened to see the invisible, you will get what you have asked for.” When the chariots of fire descended from heaven, Elisha saw them and cried, <strong>“My Father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof”</strong> (2 Kings 2:12). God must have said, “His spiritual eyes are opened; he can have what he wants.” When your spiritual eyes become open, your destiny also opens up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2 Kings 6:15-23, the Syrian army surrounded Elisha’s house; his servant saw them and was terrified. He ran to tell Elisha about the situation, and Elisha prayed that God would open his spiritual eyes. After he prayed, God opened his servant’s eyes, and the fellow who was scared became courageous because he could now see the invisible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>…And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha</strong></i>. 2 Kings 6:17</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God opens your spiritual eyes, you’ll be able to see beyond the physical realm, and you’ll have a better understanding of the divine power that backs you up as a Christian. If God has been using you before, this will further strengthen your faith and empower you to do more exploits for His kingdom. For this to happen, you must be born again, and your spirit must be better fed than your body. This can be done by praying, studying God’s word, fasting, worshipping intensely, and fellowshipping with other believers consistently.</p>",

Elisha, however, was not bothered; he told his servant that those who were with them were more than those who were against them. He then prayed that God should open his servant’s eyes. Even though the boy wasn’t physically blind and could see the Syrian army, his spiritual eyes needed to be opened so he could see God’s mighty army surrounding them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>…And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</strong></i> 2 Kings 6:17</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After God opened the spiritual eyes of Elisha’s servant, his fear of the Syrian army must have disappeared immediately. Elisha then asked God to smite the Syrian soldiers with blindness, and he led them to the king’s palace. He wasn’t holding any weapon, neither did he bind the soldiers; he just told them to follow him, and because they had become blind, they followed him into their enemy’s territory. They would have lost their lives that day if Elisha had not stopped the king from killing them. He was able to arrest the soldiers who came to arrest him because he could see beyond the physical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Samuel 17, Israel was being tormented by Goliath. The torment went on for 40 days and nights because there was no one on the battlefield whose spiritual eyes were opened. They all saw a formidable giant, but David came to the battlefield and saw Goliath as a dead man. David said to him, “I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. Today, I will cut off your head and feed the Philistine army to the birds so that the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel” (1 Samuel 17:45-46).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, what you see with your spiritual eyes will go a long way in determining if you will live as a victim or a victorious believer. If you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, spend quality time in constant fellowship with Him. As you do this, I pray that the Lord will open your spiritual eyes. If, however, the Lord has already opened your spiritual eyes, I pray for greater revelations for you, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>In today’s memory verse, God promised that He would pour out His Spirit in the last days, and old men will dream dreams while the young men will see visions. Whether you are old or young, God wants you to do exploits with His Spirit that lives in you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God gives you a vision, He expects you to run with it. You may encounter obstacles, but you must see beyond them. For example, in Numbers 13 and 14, Moses sent 12 spies to search the Promised Land and bring him a report. The 12 spies returned with giant grapes to show that the land was indeed flowing with milk and honey; however, ten of them complained that there were giants in the land. Caleb and Joshua, who had a clear vision of God’s promise, said, “We saw what you saw with our physical eyes, but if this land eats up its inhabitants, then there would be no people there. God gave us the vision, and He will help us take the land. Let’s go ahead and possess the land.” The Bible says in Numbers 32:11-12 that while all the children of Israel in that generation perished, only Joshua and Caleb made it to the Promised Land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the vision God has given to you will sustain you and prolong your days. No matter your age, if you can still see what God wants you to see clearly and are ready to pursue it, He will ensure that He keeps you alive and in good shape. Abraham was 75 years old when God called him to go to a land He would show him (Genesis 12:1-4). Because he was willing to run with this vision, God kept him alive until he was 175 years old (Genesis 25:7-8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If God has given you a vision, run with it; do not give in to any obstacle. Also, do not run ahead of God, as this will only lead you into trouble. Habakkuk 2:3 says, <strong>“For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.” </strong>This means that you need patience to run with the vision God has given you (Hebrews 12:1). This way, you will not make hasty and rash decisions as you pursue the vision. I pray that you will fulfil every vision that God has given to you, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

Unfortunately, some parents are careless with their words. They are not diligent in processing what is in their hearts before they speak; therefore, what comes out of their mouths towards their children is not wholesome. Parents should bless their children, not curse them or make negative pronouncements on them. When Rachel gave birth to her second son, she pronounced a curse on him because of the pain she went through in childbearing. If Jacob had not changed that name to Benjamin, that child would probably have lived a sorrowful life (Genesis 35:18).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people live in sorrow because of the evil pronouncements their parents made over them. Parents should not do that to their children; instead, they should use their mouths to bless them every day. They should also learn to keep some things that God reveals to them about their children to themselves so that they don’t expose them to human and demonic attacks. Mary kept the things she had received concerning Jesus in her heart (Luke 2:19). It isn’t everything God shows parents about their children that they should share. Some things are for an appointed time; they should wait for that time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parents should also not share everything about what is going on in their children’s lives on social media. Social media is a marketplace with different kinds of people. If Mary or Joseph had been careless about the whereabouts of Jesus when God told them to leave for Egypt, Herod could have found a means to kill him in Egypt. Parents should be wise about sharing their children’s information online. Some children have gotten into the wrong hands because their parents were careless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deuteronomy 6:6-9 says that parents must teach their children God’s ways. They must tell them about His laws in the morning, noon, and night, and use every opportunity to drill God’s word into their minds. If you’re a parent, use your mouth to raise your children, not tear them down. My mother would always bless me by saying that when I call one person, hundreds will come running, and today, those blessings have truly manifested in my life. Let your words be seasoned with grace always (Colossians 4:6). Let your lips be a wellspring of life to your children. Let them always know they will meet words of life, not death, on your lips.</p>",

My wife is a helpmeet indeed, and a true helpmeet is a great blessing not just to her husband but her in-laws as well. She won’t seek to compete with them or disrespect them; rather, she will help her husband by honouring his people. Nowadays, some women say that they are only married to their husbands and do not care about their in-laws. This is not right because their husbands came from a home, and as helpmeets, they have a responsibility to love their husbands’ people too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ruth was a wise woman. When she married Naomi’s son, she took Naomi as her mother. Her love for Naomi was so great that when her husband died, she abandoned her hometown to follow her mother-in-law to a place she had never been. She was ready to risk everything to care for her aged mother-in-law. In return, God rewarded her selflessness by giving her another home. Ruth’s service to her mother-in-law opened the door of fruitfulness to her (Ruth 1-4), and in the account of the genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1:1-16, you will find her name in verse 5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Loving in-laws is, however, not peculiar to wives alone. Husbands must also love and honour their in-laws. The fact that they have fulfilled all the necessary traditional marriage rites does not mean their wives’ parents and family members are unimportant. For example, Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law when he visited Peter’s house in Matthew 8:14-15. Immediately Jesus healed her, she arose and ministered to them. If she hadn't been treated well before that time, and if she wasn’t made to feel welcomed in the house, she wouldn’t have thought of serving everyone present, including her son-in-law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re married, God put you in your spouse’s family because He wants you to extend His love to them. Whether they reciprocate or not, your responsibility is to love them. No man snuffs out the little light he has because every other person is living in darkness. Instead, he makes his light shine brighter for all to see. If your inlaws don’t believe in Jesus yet, your marriage has given you the opportunity to show them the light. Ask God for the wisdom to relate with them, and in everything you do, let the love of Christ rule your heart, actions, and decisions.</p>",

While it is not bad to criticise people who are not doing what they ought to be doing, you must not just stop there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word </strong></i>1 Kings 17:1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the Scripture above, we see that Elijah started out as a critic. The king wasn’t behaving in the right manner, and just like any critic, Elijah walked into the palace and confronted him. However, he didn’t stop there; he moved on to become a vessel that God used to provide for the needs of a poor widow and her son (1 Kings 17:8-16).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Would you rather become a mere critic or an activist whom God will use to put solutions forward? Would you be content with only carrying placards and protesting or also becoming so wealthy that you can feed the hungry? Carrying placards and protesting will attract the attention of the people you are criticising. However, beyond that, you must grow to a point where you can recommend and even provide some of the solutions you are demanding. Don’t just become a critic that challenges those in authority; grow to the point where your impact cannot be ignored.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This message is particularly for youths. They should learn from Moses who thought he could fulfil his destiny his own way, and as a result, he had to stay in the wilderness for another 40 years until he was ready. The positive change you want can happen, but you must be wise enough to let it happen in God’s way. Matthew 10:16 says,<strong> “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”</strong> Christians need to be as strategic as serpents. The most dangerous thing about a serpent is its silence when it wants to attack its prey. When it attacks, the prey only realises it when it is already too late.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, be wise. God has a great destiny for you, but you must not let overzealousness prevent you from fulfilling your destiny. Rather than just being a mere noisemaker, increase your capacity so that you can indeed become a force to be reckoned with. Your zeal should be matched with the right knowledge and actions (Romans 10:1-2).</p>",

      "<p>Every day, people see problems that they wish they could do something about. What if God could use you to bring a solution to every problem you encounter or make you the solution to that lingering issue in your family? If something terrible happens in your neighbourhood, can you say a simple prayer that will effect a change such that the people who were in sorrow will start rejoicing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the widow of one of the sons of the prophets came to Elisha because of her debt problem, she didn’t return home the same. Elisha opened her eyes to see that the solution she desperately needed was in her house. He showed her the secret to getting out of debt and living a financially independent life (2 Kings 4:1-7). Sometimes, becoming the solution to another person’s problem is not by giving them money but by opening their eyes to see what they have never paid attention to, empowering them with the correct knowledge and information to live a bondage-free life. Jesus said, <i><strong>“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” </strong></i>(John 8:32). Jesus is the way, the TRUTH, and the life (John 14:6). Hence, the ultimate way to help people with problems is to introduce Him to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, when the son of the widow died, she didn’t turn to the king for help. Instead, she turned to Elijah, and God used him to raise her dead son. If such a thing happened around you, do you have the capacity for God to provide such a solution through you? You may say, “Oh, I am not a prophet like Elijah.” However, there is no record in the Scriptures that only ordained ministers of God can perform miracles. Mark 16:17-18 says, <i><strong>“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”</strong></i> Jesus is the ultimate solution to every problem, and He has given those who believe in Him the authority to perform signs and wonders in His name. To do this, however, you must exercise your spirit more than your flesh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, be the kind of believer who studies the Bible and prays regularly. When you are such, then God will make you a solution to the problems of many people around you.</p>",

People who settle easily cannot move higher because they either think they have enough or lack the capacity or ability to achieve more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I once travelled to Rivers, a state in Southern Nigeria, and ministered in several locations within the state. In one of the locations, while I was ministering, I laid my hands on some sick people. When I finished, I wanted to wash my hands, so two ladies brought water and soap for me – one was carrying a bowl of soapy water, and the other was carrying a bowl with clean water. As I was washing my hands inside the bowl of soapy water, I sensed in my spirit that the lady carrying the bowl was hungry for the anointing. Suddenly, I felt the anointing of God flowing from me into the water, then through the bowl and into her hands. Suddenly, she began to vibrate violently, and someone had to quickly take the bowl from her hands. The people around quickly got her a chair to sit on, but she continued shaking under the influence of the anointing. The interesting thing was that the anointing was still in the water and in the bowl, but the person who took the bowl from her did not feel anything. He didn’t feel anything because he was not hungry for more. Hunger attracts greater levels of the anointing and draws people into higher realms in God. Those who are hungry for more of God are always willing to pay the price. They don’t complain when it is time to fast or grumble when it is time to pray. Because they are hungry, they are willing and ready to do all it takes to go higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you hungry for more of God? Do you wish to go higher in God? Indeed, in John 7:37, it is those who thirst that Jesus invited to drink from Him. However, He also said you must come to Him before you can drink from Him. A lot of people talk about how they long to go higher; however, when the time comes to do what it takes to come to Him, they are the first to say that they can’t fast, pray, or study their Bibles for long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, thirst to go higher in God, but also be prepared to give what it takes.</p>",

If You want me to be who You say You want me to be, I want to at least do the works that Jesus did, and even greater.” The Lord said, “No problem. It’s just that you will have to start from where Jesus started. He fasted for 40 days and nights before He performed His first miracle.” At that time, the only times I ever fasted was on Good Fridays, and those fasts only lasted from morning until 12 noon. I told God, “40 days and nights?” He responded, “Well, you are the one who said you want to do what Jesus did, and even greater, so you have to start from where He started.” I almost said, “Lord, don’t worry,” but I thought to myself, “If there is anything you learnt in Mathematics, it is that you start from the known to the unknown, from simple equations to simultaneous, quadratic, exponential, and so on.” So, I started with three days and nights; I’m telling you, it felt like three months. After some time, fasting for three days and nights every month was no longer difficult for me, so I moved on to five days and then seven until I got to fasting for 40 days and nights more than once a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you can attain any height if you are steadily growing in the right direction.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t get any. I kept driving until I got to Benin, but I still couldn’t get any fuel to buy. I continued my journey until I got to Ore. By then, the car’s fuel tank was on reserve. I didn’t know what to do. It was a Sunday evening, and I had to give some lectures the next morning. Then, God spoke to me, “Son, take your eyes off the gauge and keep driving.” I drove the car on reserve fuel from Ore until I parked in my house in Surulere (over 200km). God can bring something out of nothing, but for you to enjoy His blessings, you must be obedient to Him. When He says go, you should go, and when He says stop, you must stop. Proverbs 3:5 says that you should not lean on your own understanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In John 5:2-9, there was an account of a man who had been ill for thirty-eight years. Jesus saw him lying by a pool and asked him, “Do you wish to get well?” The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is troubled.” Jesus then said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and walk.” Immediately, the man became well and began to walk. His simple obedience to Jesus’ instruction to rise and take up his bed broke the bondage he was in for thirty-eight years. No matter how long a problem has existed, once God sends His word and you obey Him, you will have total freedom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More than four decades ago, I was to travel outside Nigeria for the first time and had never been inside an aeroplane before. I was a lecturer at the University of Lagos and was to give a presentation in Sierra Leone. I was a bit anxious because I had never travelled outside the country, but then, somebody gave me instructions on how to clear myself at the airport. I listened, obeyed the instructions, and my journey was successful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when God gives you an instruction, don’t think you are wiser than Him. He knows the end from the beginning and the best pathway for your life. If you want to succeed in life, simply obey God’s instructions. Obedience always precedes the miraculous.</p>",

A person can dream about achieving a particular feat, but if he or she does not prepare adequately towards this, when the opportunity comes, the fellow will be caught unawares and it will become obvious that he or she never prepared for it. In today’s Bible reading, you will observe that David had been preparing himself for war while he was in the desert tending sheep. He had no weapons, but he continually trained until he mastered how to use a sling perfectly. His ‘lucky day’ came when he encountered Goliath and defeated him with just one swing of his sling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. </strong></i>1 Samuel 17:50</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike David, Rehoboam wasn’t prepared for the throne of Israel. Although he was the son of King Solomon, who many consider to be Israel’s wisest king, he was very foolish. He was the heir to the throne, and it would have been expected that he would have been preparing for the day he would become king. Unfortunately, he wasn’t prepared for something that he knew was coming, and he failed (2 Chronicles 10:1-19).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a student knows that a school examination is coming and he or she doesn’t prepare, such a student can be said to be foolish.

If a pastor who knows that he or she will preach a message on Sunday does not fast, pray, or study for the message, he or she is the devil hindering his or her own growth. When the time for a big breakthrough comes in your life, I pray that you will be prepared, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s memory verse says that time and chance happens to every human being on the earth.

They know a lot about Him, but they don’t know Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul thought he knew God until the day he had an encounter with Jesus Christ. When you truly meet Jesus, you will become a completely new person. Before Paul met Jesus, he persecuted believers. However, when he met Him, his story changed. In 1 Timothy 1:13-16, he spoke about his horrible past as a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an injurious person, and how he obtained mercy from God. In Christ, he became a Chief Apostle (2 Corinthians 11:5) and fulfilled his destiny (2 Timothy 4:6- 7).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Peter was just another fisherman from Galilee before he met Jesus. However, when he met Jesus, he was given a glorious destiny (Luke 5:10). Even when he failed and denied Jesus, his future was still secure because of his encounter with Jesus. When a man meets Jesus, his failures and weaknesses become part of his success story because God works all things together for his good (Romans 8:28).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah thought he knew God until he had an encounter in Isaiah 6 that changed his life. When he saw the Lord in His glory, he fell on his face and cried, <i><strong>“…Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts” </strong></i>(Isaiah 6:5). After meeting the Lord, Isaiah was willing to go wherever the Lord sent Him. When you truly meet Jesus, all your excuses will be burnt away like chaff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you genuinely want to meet Jesus, make it mandatory for yourself to study God’s word every day. Revelation 19:13 says that He is the Word of God. When you study the word of God, you are fellowshipping with Jesus Christ. The more of God’s word you study, the closer you will get to Him. It will be difficult at first because the devil will try to stop you, but as you keep at it, you will discover that you are being transformed because you are getting to know the Son of God for yourself.</p>",

The moment you let Jesus in, your past will no longer determine your future – only Jesus will. With Jesus living in you, your future will only get brighter and brighter (Proverbs 4:18).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may say, “I already let Jesus into my heart some time ago.” That is good, but do you still get convicted of certain sins when you listen to a sermon or read your Bible? If yes, that means there are some parts of your life that Jesus hasn’t taken over yet, and He is knocking on the door of your heart so you can let Him in. There is no partial salvation; Ephesians 5:27 says that Jesus is coming for a bride without blemish or wrinkle. If there’s still a blemish in your life, surrender it completely to Jesus Christ today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may also say, “I have a good relationship with Jesus.” However, there is more. David described a relationship with God as a journey into the deep. He said,<i><strong> “Deep calleth unto deep.”</strong></i> (Psalm 42:7). After walking, eating, and talking with Jesus during His earthly ministry for three and a half years, John saw Him in a vision in Revelation 4:1, and Jesus told him, <i><strong>“…Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.”</strong></i> There are always higher realms in God, and Jesus is standing at the door of your heart, knocking and calling you to come up higher. It is not enough to just confess Jesus as your Lord and Saviour; there is more. God wants you to operate in His miraculous power (Mark 16:17-18). He wants you to be an agent of change, but you need the power of the Holy Spirit to do that. There will always be higher doors to enter and deeper realms to access in God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, Jesus is knocking at the door of your heart today. He is calling you to higher and deeper levels in your relationship with Him. Open your heart to Him; He will beautify your life with His glory and make you an agent of change for His kingdom.</p>",

You might wonder, “Why did God have to tell Abraham to go outside and look at the stars? Why didn’t He just tell him that his descendants would be so many that it would be impossible to count them?” I believe it was because God needed Abraham to see what he would be getting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, in Genesis 13:14-17, God told Abraham, “All the land you see shall be yours.” He also said, “Move away from where you are, walk through the land as far as you can, and it shall all be yours.” God knew that for Abraham to own the land, he had to first have a vision of it.

All you have to do is regulate your faith to see only what Jesus has promised you, and that is what you will get.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, Moses sent the twelve spies to check out the land of Canaan, and they came back with reports. While Caleb and Joshua saw themselves inhabiting the land, the remaining ten spies saw giants and a land that swallowed up its inhabitants. Joshua and Caleb saw God’s mighty ability, but the others saw themselves as grasshoppers. In the end, everyone got what they saw. The ten spies were swallowed up in the wilderness while Joshua and Caleb got into the land and inhabited it (Numbers 32:11-12).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, what do you see in your life, marriage, or career? Whatever you see is what you will get. If you see victory, you will walk in it. However, if you see defeat, you will experience it. God wants you to see correctly, and the only way to do this is to know what He says in His word. What has God said about your home, children, career, health, and life? Believe His promises concerning you, and they shall come to pass.</p>",

      "<p>Today’s Bible reading says that you should only ask God for things in faith. It further says that if you doubt, you should not expect to get anything from God. I know that some situations can look scary and tough, but if you want to live above those situations, you have to believe in God. In Matthew 14:28-29, Peter’s faith was unwavering when he told Jesus, “…bid me come unto thee on the water.” However, when he looked at the boisterous wind around him and stopped believing, he started to sink. No matter how tough things are, do not lose your faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I got born again in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I was extremely happy about my salvation, but I was very sickly. Every two weeks, I would be sick with malaria and would require medical treatment. At that time, whenever Christians talked about healing without medication, I did not believe them. I used to say, “You have shown me the way to heaven; don’t send me there too quickly.” Then, one day, I heard a testimony from an old man about how God miraculously healed him of a bent back, and immediately, my faith was aroused. I thank God that since that time, that faith has been getting stronger daily. If you want to see great miracles in your life, believe what God has said. If He has done mighty wonders before, He can do them again and again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I once went to a Kenneth Hagin campmeeting in the United States of America and saw about 7,000 people in one convention. I had never seen anything like that before because, at that time, the entire congregation of The Redeemed Christian Church of God was less than 1,000. However, while on the plane back to Nigeria, I told those who went with me that, one day, our pastors alone would be more than 17,000. They didn’t believe me. Today, God has surpassed my expectations. When you have faith in God, He sets you up to break records. He makes you a wonder unto many when you believe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Science says prove it, and I will believe you. However, God says believe Me, then I will prove it. When God asks you to do something, believe Him. Don’t try to add or remove from what He has said. Just believe, and He will do exceeding abundantly above all that you ask or think (Ephesians 3:20).</p>",

You can go home now.” She said, “I cannot go home because I don’t have the money to travel back.” I didn’t have much then either, but I divided the little money I had into two and gave her one half – this happened in June. By the following August, she came back and bought a big cow for the church’s annual convention. God can turn people’s stories around and make their lives better in a very short time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I heard the story of a woman who was barren. Her pastor had been praying with her for the fruit of the womb for several years, but nothing happened. Finally, the pastor called her and said, “All the other barren women that I have prayed for have already become mothers. Why is your case different?” The woman then told the pastor that when she was young, she got pregnant and tried to have an abortion, which failed. To save her life, the doctors removed her womb. The pastor asked, “Do you mean you have no womb?” The woman replied, “Yes”. The pastor asked again, “Then why are you asking me to pray that you become pregnant?” The woman replied, “But you’re the one who taught us that with God, nothing shall be impossible.” From that day, the pastor began to avoid her. Anytime he saw the woman coming from one direction, he would walk away from her in the opposite direction. This went on for a while, and one day, the woman told herself, “It’s alright. If the pastor is avoiding me, I will look unto God and take my eyes off him.” That night, she had a dream in which she was standing naked in a room. A huge man came through the wall with the skin of an animal in his hand. She became so frightened that she couldn’t move. When the man got to her, he wrapped the skin of the animal around her and disappeared. She woke up, shaking and sweating, but immediately, she knew that God had come to give her a new womb. Today, she is the mother of many beautiful children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, Jesus is the master at turning negative situations around.

      "<p>Whenever demons get involved in people’s lives, they usually set up evil patterns in their lives that become difficult to break. Such patterns will become so strong that such people will feel helpless, even when they can see themselves heading towards destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you speak to people who are addicted to pornography or engage in a bad habit like smoking, you will often learn that the pattern started when things in their lives were beginning to look promising. The devil set up those evil patterns in the lives of his victims to ensure that they do not experience the things that God has in store for them. However, once the patterns are broken, they become free from his stronghold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To break these evil patterns, it is important to ask the Holy Spirit for help. Today’s Bible reading tells us that only a stronger man can take things that are in the possession of a strong man. When a demon tries to introduce an evil pattern into the life of a believer, the Holy Spirit helps him or her to prevent it. Many people make the mistake of relying on their strength to fight off the devil; however, that does not work. Instead, they should engage in a spiritual exercise that will cause them to be filled with the Holy Ghost. They can start worshipping God or praying in tongues. As they do this, they will weaken the devil’s influence in their lives. They must, however, be willing to continue in this practice indefinitely. As they continue to do this, they will discover after a while that they have become so strong in the Holy Spirit, and the yoke has been broken over them. Isaiah 10:27 says that the yoke will be broken by reason of the anointing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus said in today’s Bible reading that when a demon is cast out of a person, it will return to check the state of its former accommodation. If it finds the place clean and empty, it will repossess the person and invite seven worse demons than itself to also come in. This means that if an evil pattern has been broken over the life of a believer, he or she must continually grow in God’s grace. Such a fellow must pray, fast, study the Scriptures, and fellowship with other believers consistently. The deeper such a fellow goes in Christ, the more assured he or she will be of a permanent victory over all forms of evil patterns.</p>",

He can choose to make a donkey talk (Numbers 22:28), provide resources in unusual places (Matthew 17:27), and use a sworn enemy to arrange for a fellow’s promotion at work like He used the Egyptians to sponsor the Israelites’ journey in the wilderness (Exodus 12:36). As a believer, don’t think you can understand all of God’s ways – all He requires from you is your faith and obedience. When you ask Him for something, you should do whatever He tells you to do and believe that He is more than able to meet your requests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who think that God is too slow and that they can handle things by themselves often get into trouble. Abraham learnt this the hard way when Sarah convinced him to help God by having a child through her servant (Genesis 16:2). That single decision is the cause of some of the major problems in the world today. If God has said He will do something, He will do it to perfection; you cannot do it better than Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, the sons of the prophets wanted to build a bigger accommodation, and they came to tell Elisha. They decided to go beside the Jordan River to get wood for the construction, and while the others were excited to start the project, one of them asked Elisha to go with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is good to make plans and embark on projects. However, if you don’t involve God in all you do, your ‘well laid-out plans’ can crumble. This was what happened to the sons of the prophets. While they were happily cutting down wood and gathering it for their building project, they suddenly had a setback. One of them had borrowed an axe, and while cutting wood with it, the axe-head fell into the water. Apart from negatively affecting the completion timeline of the project, this setback also meant that they had incurred some debt because the axe was borrowed. Thank God one of them had earlier involved Elisha. He simply asked them where the axe-head fell, cut down a stick, and threw it into the water. What happened next cannot be explained by science; the stick sank, and the heavy axe head swam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s ways are not man’s ways, and only a fool will always try to explain how God works. When it comes to relating with God, faith and obedience is all He expects of you because His ways are past finding out.</p>",

Hence, you must take personal responsibility for your spiritual growth. Don’t depend on your pastors to do what you should do by yourself. Any Christian who does not grow spiritually will be ill prepared to face the storms of life. He or she will be unable to take on responsibilities in God’s kingdom and will be at the mercy of every satanic attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When giving out important assignments, God will always bypass a spiritual baby for a more mature believer. This is why it is important for you to pay the price for spiritual growth. You need to consistently feed on the word of God and spend time in His presence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many years ago, when nobody lived at the Redemption Camp (now Redemption City), I would leave my house in Mushin, a suburb of Lagos every Tuesday morning and stay at the camp until Thursday morning. Apart from me, the only other people at the camp were the carpenters who were involved in the ongoing construction work. However, they would stop as soon as it was dark and retire for the day, leaving me alone to seek God’s face with all my heart all night. One night – I remember that night like it was yesterday – I prayed: “Father, I surrender all. It is only You that I want. I don’t want to be an ordinary pastor. I am not asking for gold, clothes, or fame. I just want You to empower me to do this work. If You’re not going to do it, please take me away.” That day, God answered my prayers, and there was a tremor in the camp that was felt as far as in Ijebu Ode, a town that is over 60 kilometres away. When you desire to grow spiritually, God will visit you in mighty ways that will shake your world for good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, what is hindering your spiritual growth?

I’m sure that if God had sent some people to preach to him, they would have refused because he could have had them arrested immediately. It took a visitation from Jesus to bring him to his knees, but after that, he needed Christians to guide him. First, the Lord told Ananias about him (Acts 9:1-17). I am sure that if God had told some other Christians about Saul at that time, they would have shut down His voice, thinking it was Satan trying to push them into trouble.

At last, one day, we scored 100%, and we said, “Let’s go and see him to hear what he will say now.” We got to him, rejoicing, but our joy was cut short when he said, “Your mates are in the university, solving advanced maths, and you are rejoicing over 100% in elementary maths.” His comment made me hate anything less than the absolute best. This is why I get disturbed when I see people celebrating mediocrity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, when secondary school results in Nigeria were presented as Grade 1, 2,3, and Pass, the principal of a particular college in Lagos was rejoicing because, for the first time in the school’s history, one of the students got a Grade 3 result.

      "<p>There are two kinds of wonders – the good and the bad. In 2 Kings 5:1-27, there was a man called Naaman, who was the captain of the host of the king of Syria. He was a leper, and Elisha asked him to go and wash in River Jordan so he could be healed. When he did, his skin became like that of a newborn baby – this is an example of a good wonder. After this, Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, ran after Naaman and fraudulently collected the gifts Elisha rejected. When Elisha discovered this, he cursed Gehazi saying, “I command that the leprosy of Naaman will cleave to you.” Immediately, Gehazi was covered with leprosy and became as white as snow – now, this is an example of a bad wonder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God manifests Himself, He performs good wonders in the lives of His children. He is gentle to His children, but He is also a consuming fire to those who refuse His Lordship. In today’s Bible reading, the children of Israel enjoyed the good wonder of preservation and escape from the angel of death. However, at the same time, the Egyptians experienced God’s judgement. At the Red Sea, while the Israelites saw the mighty wonder of God as the sea parted for them to walk through it, the Egyptians were drowned by that same sea (Exodus 14:21-28). God is a God of wonders, but the type of wonders a fellow will experience from Him will depend on whether he or she is for Him or against Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, are you on the Lord’s side (Exodus 32:26) or in the devil’s camp? It is not only unbelievers who are not on the Lord’s side; carnal Christians are also not on His side. Paul said in Romans 8:7 that the carnal mind is enmity against God because it is not subject to God’s law and can never be. A carnal Christian wants to do things his or her way but not in God’s way. Such Christians are moved by what they see and not by God’s word. Anyone who lives like them will not enjoy God’s good wonder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not yet born again and you want God to make your life an example of a good wonder to others, come to His side today and surrender all to Jesus. If you are already God’s child, refuse to be a carnal Christian and totally surrender your mind to be constantly renewed by His word.</p>",

      "<p>When God wants to set the stage for new things, He often starts by giving new miracles and blessings. When He wanted to deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, He started by using Moses’ rod to perform several miracles that no one had ever seen (Exodus 4:17). When Jesus came to establish a new covenant, He performed so many new miracles that people said they had never seen such things happen before (Mark 2:12). Likewise, when it was time for the apostles to take the gospel beyond Jerusalem into Samaria, Judea, and other parts of the world, Peter’s shadow began to heal the sick (Acts 5:15). Personally, I have noticed that whenever God wants to take us to a new level in RCCG, He begins by introducing new miracles that have never been experienced in our midst.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, the Full Gospel Business Men’s Fellowship International had a convention in Port Harcourt, a city in Southern Nigeria and invited me to speak on the topic, ‘New Anointing’. As I spoke, I gave some examples of what God, in His infinite mercies, had done through me. When it was time to go home, the crowd began to surge forward such that I had to be guided into my car. A woman who had a sister that had gone completely mad decided that she would touch my car if she could not touch me. So, she took out a handkerchief, dropped it on the car I was in, and took it back before we drove off. On getting home, she asked six hefty men to hold her sister down. Waving her handkerchief, she said, “I have the solution in my hand.” She then took the handkerchief and laid it on her sister, and she became normal again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God wants to move you to a new level, He usually starts with new miracles. Hence, you must be on the lookout for such miracles in your life so you can understand your seasons. Beyond looking out for such miracles, you can also ask for them. In Acts 4:29-30, the apostles asked God to facilitate the spread of the gospel by stretching forth His mighty hand to heal the sick and perform signs and wonders. The result of this prayer was tremendous growth and increase in the church (Acts 4:31-33).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, ask God for new miracles in your life today. By doing this, you will initiate growth into a new season of your life.</p>",

      "<p>In Acts 4:21-30, after the apostles were imprisoned and &nbsp;threatened, they returned to their own company, and with one accord, they lifted up their voices to God. The first result of their prayers was that they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to preach the word of God with boldness (Acts 4:31). Another result of their corporate prayers was the grace and power to preach the good news of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ, as we see in Acts 4:33:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do you want great boldness to do God’s will? Do you want to experience great power and grace? Then, you must live in unity with other believers. Whenever there is peace and unity among believers, God’s power is unlimited. In Acts 12:1-5, Herod began to persecute and kill Christians. He first arrested James, the brother of John, and because there was no resistance from the believers, he killed him. Afterwards, he arrested Peter and imprisoned him, planning to kill him after Easter. However, the church gathered together to pray continuously for Peter and did not stop until he was miraculously delivered from Herod (Acts 12:6-11).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We must also live in unity with other believers if we want to experience exponential increase. The devil understands the power of unity in the church; therefore, he constantly tries to do all he can to keep us in disunity by making us fight one another and gossip about ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, when the devil tried to cause disunity in the early church, the apostles quickly appointed faithful men to take care of the people who were complaining. Immediately the apostles solved the problem that threatened to divide the church, the word of God increased, and the number of disciples multiplied. Churches that are not operating in unity will not see the increase of God’s word and power among them until they deal with the things causing disunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not neglect the times set aside for corporate prayers in your local assembly. The church is a family, and a popular saying goes: the family that prays together stays together. This is true because the Bible says that one shall chase a thousand, but two shall chase tens of thousands.</p>",

The doctors told her that they needed to remove the dead baby from her womb because it was already decaying, and it posed a health risk to her. However, because the RCCG Congress was near, she told them, “Let me go to the congress first; if God does not perform a miracle, then you can remove the baby.” They told her, “If we delay the procedure for one more week, you will likely die.” Still, she insisted on attending the programme. On the first and second days of the programme, nothing happened. However, on the third day, God’s power came down so heavily that I could not stand; I had to ask for a chair while I was preaching. As I was about to sit down, God spoke and said that there was a woman in the congregation whose baby had died in her womb for a long time, and He was bringing the baby back to life. Instantly, the baby came back to life, and she delivered the baby in due time. Beloved, if your business, marriage, ministry, or any other part of your life has been pronounced dead, I decree that God will breathe new life into it, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our members attended a programme where we anointed some handkerchiefs. Some days later, while driving to Lagos, he saw a crowd gathered on the road. Out of curiosity, he came out of his car and discovered that a motorcyclist had been knocked down by a vehicle, and he lay dead by the roadside. He was moved with compassion and then had a leading to bring out the anointed handkerchief and lay it on the corpse. He found his way through the crowd, laid the handkerchief on the dead man, and said, “Get up!” The onlookers thought he was mentally unstable until they saw the dead man come back to life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can restore dead things to life and make them as good as new. He can revive a dead business, breathe new life into it, and bring it to a place of global relevance. He can also revive a dead marriage and make it as good as new again. Nothing is ‘too dead’ where Jesus is concerned because He is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). If He raised Lazarus after he had been dead for four days, no case is impossible with Him (Luke 1:37).</p>",

In Genesis 41:38-44, Joseph had a breakthrough, but that breakthrough took several years to manifest the way God showed him several years earlier in a dream. Moses also had a breakthrough that had been promised over a long period of time before its manifestation (Exodus 3:1-15). He had known long before then that God had chosen him to deliver the Israelites (Acts 7:22-25), but the manifestation took years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is, however, another level of breakthrough like the one recorded in 1 Samuel 16:11-13, where a shepherd boy was anointed as the king of Israel without prior notice. In Esther 2:15-18, a slave girl became a queen in a foreign land; that is also a new level of breakthrough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you read the book of Ruth, you will see certain lessons that will help you experience a new level of breakthrough. After experiencing sadness and sorrow, Ruth decided to follow her mother-in-law, Naomi, from Moab – her own country – to Bethlehem. Moab was a nation of idol worshippers, but she decided to forsake the idols she had grown up with to worship the God of Israel. She must have also left many childhood friends and close relatives behind – she practically left her old life to start a new one. You cannot keep holding on to the past if you want to experience a new level of breakthrough. You must let go of your past life and old habits to receive the new things God has for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. </strong></i>Isaiah 43:18-19</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ruth found her breakthrough in Bethlehem because she served and followed the good advice she often received from her mother-in-law. She was a hardworking woman, and her diligence made Boaz notice her among the other workers in his field and show her favour (Ruth 2:1-16). In today’s Bible reading, you will also see that it was Ruth’s obedience to Naomi’s advice that led to her becoming Boaz’s wife.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you want to experience new breakthroughs in your life, you must obey the word of God completely. You must also seek and follow godly counsel while ensuring that you are diligent in all you do.</p>",

To live above the flesh, a child of God must keep feeding and filling his or her spirit with the word of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The story of Peter in Luke 22:54-62 is very sobering. He was one of the disciples whom Jesus sent to some cities and towns to preach the gospel and who returned with joy because devils were subject to them (Luke 10:17). He was also present when Jesus fed the five thousand (Mark 6:35- 44) and raised Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44). At some point, he even walked on water (Matthew 14:28-29). As long as Peter fed his spirit, the devil couldn’t touch him. However, the moment he began to feed his ego by boasting that he would never deny Jesus (Matthew 26:34-35), he became weak spiritually. Jesus had warned Peter that the devil had targeted him to make him fall (Luke 22:31), but instead of running back to the secret place to fortify himself, he kept boasting about his inability to fall until he eventually fell. When you don’t feed your spirit, you will become vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy. You will become overly sensitive to offences and will easily get annoyed and irritated by many things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Feeding your spirit must be a regular exercise. In Matthew 6:34, Jesus said, <i><strong>“…Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”</strong></i> In other words, to overcome the evil of each day, you must feed your spirit every day. You must spend time in God’s word. Joshua 1:8 says,<i><strong> “This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night…”</strong></i> You must also spend time in prayer so that you won’t become a victim of the enemy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some pastors have become so familiar with the word that they don’t see the need to study their Bibles and pray as before. They can cook up a sermon in a short time, and this makes them think they are okay spiritually. If you keep starving your spirit, it is only a matter of time before you will become dry. Don’t let the devil deceive you into thinking you are okay when you are not feeding your spirit. He wants to drain you so he can conquer you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, feed your spirit every single day by studying the word of God and fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit.</p>",

It is because there is power in what we say. If you are the redeemed of the Lord and you keep speaking the words of the unredeemed, you will reap the fruits of the things you say. When a believer whose speech should be gracious and seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6) keeps speaking negative and careless words, it is only a matter of time before his or her life starts to look like the negative words that have been spoken. When things don’t go your way or when the economy looks unfavourable, do not forget that you are the redeemed of the Lord, and as a result, you are programmed for victory. Hence, you should not re-program yourself for failure and defeat through your words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fill your heart with the words of God so that His words will continually be on your lips no matter the things or situations that come your way, for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks (Luke 6:45). If you, however, occupy your mind with wrong or negative words, those words will come to play when the storms of life arise. You can’t be bold enough to say that the Lord is your helper when you have not heard and believed that God will never leave you nor forsake you. What you keep hearing is what builds confidence or fear in you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any circumstance you find yourself, check what God’s word says concerning it; hold on to the word and speak it into the situation. Ensure that the words on your lips align with what God has said in His word, but to do this, you must fill your heart with His word. You must ensure that the words of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom (Colossians 3:16). When God’s word fills your heart, your words will be wholesome and full of grace, and your life will truly reflect His glory.</p>",

John 17:17 says, “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” When you want to know the truth about anything, search through the Scriptures. When you want to know the truth about your health, don’t keep staring at a medical report; instead, focus on God’s word and believe in what He has said in His word concerning your health. 1 Peter 2:24 says that by His stripes, you were healed. This is a settled matter, and regardless of what any report says, good health and healing is the truth about you. When you want to know the truth about your finances, read through God’s word, not the economic report or forecast. Economists can say whatever they want to say, but you must choose to believe the word of the Lord. God’s word contains the truth about everything that concerns you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God’s word is also life (John 6:63). If anything in your life or around you is dead, God’s word can bring it back to life. By His word, Peter’s dead business received a net-breaking, boat-sinking revival (Luke 5:1-7). By His word, the dead son of the widow of Nain jumped back to life (Luke 7:11-15). God’s word is alive. According to today’s memory verse, His word is living, active, and sharper than any two-edged sword.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s memory verse further tells us that the word of God reveals things that are ordinarily not easy to see or understand. There is nothing hidden under the sun that God’s word cannot unveil (Hebrews 4:13). Apart from unveiling the things that are hidden, God’s word brings peace amid storms. When Jesus and His disciples were trying to cross to the other side of a sea, they didn’t expect that they would be caught in the middle of a storm. The storm came, and it was so fierce that the disciples thought they would die. They began to panic, but thankfully, Jesus was in the boat, and His word calmed the storm (Mark 4:35- 39).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God’s word contains all that you need in life.

      "<p>In Matthew 15:21-28, when a Canaanite woman came to Jesus to ask Him to deliver her daughter from a demon, she came worshipping. I believe that her genuine worship and faith in Jesus Christ helped her obtain the miracle she requested. In today’s Bible reading, a leper came to Jesus and worshipped Him. Jesus touched him and spoke healing to him; his worship attracted a physical touch from Jesus. The man’s condition was hopeless until he met Jesus and worshipped Him. He bowed down as a leper to worship Jesus; however, by the time he finished worshipping and got up, he had been made whole. Your worship will make you a candidate for God’s personal touch, and when God touches a fellow, his or her life is transformed positively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus said in John 4:23:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is not seeking part-time worshippers; rather, he is seeking those who will make worship their lifestyle. He wants those who will keep breaking their alabaster box and pouring their sweet fragrance of worship upon Him (Mark 14:3). When you worship God, you should put all your attention on Him. It is not about what you can get from Him; it is about who He is. When you make God the centre of your life and delight yourself in Him in the place of worship, He will not withhold anything from you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have always told my children that everyone else may see miracles happening around them, but worshippers always experience miracles in their lives. When you are a worshipper, the testimonies you read of in the Scriptures and hear about will become your daily experience. Whenever a true worshipper prays, God is always quick to answer. When you worship, demons flee from you because they cannot dare to stay in a place where God is. This is the explanation for what happened in 1 Samuel 16:23:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, live a holy life and spend quality time worshipping God daily for who He is and not just for what you want to gain from Him. When this becomes your lifestyle, you will see Him perform mighty wonders in your life.</p>",

While others were dying of hunger, he enjoyed supernatural provisions throughout the famine. When you have an encounter with the Holy Spirit, you will receive divine instructions that will keep you from experiencing some hardships that other people experience. In times of famine, you will be satisfied, and you will not be ashamed in the evil time (Psalm 37:19).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1 Kings 18:44-46, when the Lord sent rain to Israel, Elijah outran the chariot of the king of Israel. Kings always have the best and fastest chariots and horses in the land, yet Elijah outran the best of the best because the Holy Spirit was upon him. I pray in the name above every other name that the hand of the Lord will rest upon you, and you will begin to live above natural limitations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ignorance is one of the worst limitations any human being can face. A lot of times, people do not recognise the resources that can save and deliver them, even when they are under their noses. This puts a lot of people under very terrible limitations. Ephesians 4:18 likens ignorance to darkness and blindness. In this Scripture, Paul said that some people have their understanding darkened and are alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their hearts. When people who can see are in darkness, there is still hope that when light comes, they will see the things that surround them. However, when people who are blind are in darkness, that is another level of darkness altogether.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ignorance limits people and keeps them from seeing what God has made available to them. In today’s Bible reading, Hagar experienced this kind of limitation until God opened her eyes. When your spiritual eyes are open, you will rise above the limitations that keep others down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must soak yourself in the word of God so that your spiritual eyes can be open. When you engage with God’s word daily, it will brighten your path and give you the understanding required to journey through life successfully (Psalm 119:105). I pray that the Lord will open your eyes to see the solutions He has provided to your challenges and remove every veil of ignorance that limits you from enjoying His fullness today, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

The devil is a bully, and like all bullies, he does not like being confronted. If someone threatens you for doing the will of God, that is not the time to start fidgeting or hiding; that is the time to pray.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, three great enemy nations came to threaten Jehoshaphat, and he was terrified. He felt threatened by the size of the enemies, and this led him to seek God. As Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah fasted and prayed, God gave them the strategy that would destroy their enemies – praise. As Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah began to sing and praise the Lord, He set the enemies against one another, and those who had previously been united against Judah suddenly turned against themselves and began to kill one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</strong></i> 2 Chronicles 20:23</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God silenced the threats of the enemies without Jehoshaphat having to lift a sword. In the name above every other name, my Daddy will arise to silence every threat of the enemy against your life and destiny, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some years ago, a woman came running to me, shaking badly. Her daughter was pregnant, and her enemies had come to threaten her, saying, "Your daughter is pregnant? We will see where she will deliver – whether on the ground or in the air. We will use every diabolical means to ensure she never gives birth." The woman was frightened, and I said to her, "Fear not! Your daughter will deliver safely." She asked, "How do you know?" I replied, "Because the Lord of Hosts will fight for you." Indeed, the Lord fought for her, and she delivered safely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, I know a God who is stronger than the strongest.

Today’s Bible reading says that you should not worry about tomorrow because God will take care of it. Sufficient unto each day are the troubles thereof; hence, you should face today’s issues rather than worry about tomorrow. Believe me, worry is an absolute waste of time. Jesus said that you cannot add one cubit to your stature by worrying (Matthew 6:27). Worry weakens; instead of worrying, believers should trust God with their future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever is placed in God’s hand will always blossom. Don’t ever think you know how to make your tomorrow good; you have absolutely no idea of what is going to happen tomorrow. For instance, many people had made careful plans before the coronavirus pandemic hit. However, because of the pandemic, they had to put their plans on hold. So many things that are beyond your control can happen, so it is better to place your future in the hands of the One who is the Beginning and the End. This is why James 4:13-16 says that you don’t know what will happen tomorrow, so whenever you are talking about the future, you should acknowledge that whatever happens will be dependent on God’s will.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was less than 40 years old when I became the General Overseer of RCCG. One day, I looked at myself in the mirror and saw grey hair all over my head. I asked God, “Lord, how did this happen?

Is it the church of Adeboye?\" I replied, “No.” Then He said, “Who told you I can't take care of My own burden? You are carrying a burden that is not yours. I just made you General Overseer so that people will see you as My representative. I am the owner of My church, and I will take care of My church.\" After hearing this, I relaxed, and my hair became black again. A few years ago, I saw some strands of grey hairs on my head and asked God, “Lord, am I worrying again?” He said, “No. This time, you are getting old.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not worry.

In Jeremiah 32:27, He said, “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?” Luke 1:37 also tells us that with God, nothing shall be impossible. Whenever anybody tells you that a situation you are in is impossible, you should know that such a person is not considering that God is all-powerful. Once you consciously invite God into a situation, things change dramatically for the better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1979, we were getting ready for a congress. We called it Christ The Redeemer’s Congress in those days. We used to hold the congress in different cities and feed everyone who attends. In preparation for this particular congress, my wife and I went to the market to buy some cows. We wanted to buy three cows to feed the people that would attend, but when we were told they would cost seven hundred and fifty naira in total, we went back home because we didn’t have the money. We asked God, “Lord, what are we going to do? Where shall we get the money to buy cows?” We began to pray, and suddenly, somebody knocked on the door. When we opened the door, we saw a brother who had come all the way from Lagos. He said, “Sir, I hope you have not bought cows yet.” We replied, “No, we don’t have the money.” He said, “I have already bought three for the congress.” The All-powerful God who has the cattle upon a thousand hills (Psalm 50:10) provided just what we needed at the nick of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The All-Powerful God can change any story, no matter how bad it is.

In other words, if a fellow gets angry easily, he or she is similar to someone who says there is no God – they are both fools (Psalm 14:1). Those who get angry easily often blame other people as the cause of their anger. If this is the case, then it means that they allow the people who offend them to control their emotions. Proverbs 25:28 says that a person who is not in control of his spirit is like a city that has no walls. If you allow others to control how you feel, then you are in great danger of destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 29:22 says, <i><strong>“An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.”</strong></i> Anyone who gets angry easily will hardly have friends because he or she will always stir up strife with them. Things that shouldn’t ordinarily cause quarrels would become big issues because of the fellow’s short temper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A man once bought a brand-new car, and one day, while he was washing it, his five-year-old son was on the other side of the car, writing something on it with a sharp object. When the man discovered this, he got very angry and shouted, “This boy! You are scratching my new car!” In his anger, he grabbed the first thing he could lay his hands on – a hammer. He then began to smash the boy’s hands. By the time he realised what he was doing, the boy’s fingers had already been severely damaged. He rushed the boy to the hospital, but the doctors could not do anything about the fingers, and they had to be amputated. The following day, the boy asked him, “Daddy, when will my fingers grow back?” Feeling guilty, the man went to the car and looked at what the boy had written on it. Lo and behold, it was, ‘I love you, Daddy’. The man could not bear the pain he felt thereafter, so he committed suicide. His anger wreaked havoc on the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you allow anger to control you, you are giving room to the devil (Ephesians 4:27), and whenever he gets into a place, his mission is to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). If you are always quick to get angry or you can’t control your anger, ask God to deliver you today. Constantly renew your mind with His word and submit yourself to counselling so that you can overcome the destructive power of anger.</p>",

You will never lack rest. David said in Psalm 23:2, “He maketh me to lie down…” When you are God’s sheep, you will not lack sleep. God gives His beloved sleep (Psalm 127:2).&nbsp;</p><p>2. You will be well-fed. Hunger is a stranger to God’s sheep because He causes them to lie down in green pastures (Psalm 23:2). Psalm 63:5 says, “My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness…”&nbsp;</p><p>3. Your thirst will be satisfied because He will lead you beside still waters (Psalm 23:2). Matthew 5:6 says, “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.”&nbsp;</p><p>4. You will never lack restoration (Psalm 23:3). In Joel 2:23-26, God promised that He will restore the years that the cankerworm and caterpillar have eaten. No matter what you lose, you are assured of total restoration when the Lord is your shepherd.&nbsp;</p><p>5. You will not lack guidance because He will lead you in the paths of righteousness (Psalm 23:3). Jesus said that the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth (John 16:12- 13). With the Holy Spirit in charge of your life, you will have absolutely nothing to worry about.</p><p>6. You will have nothing to fear because you will enjoy God’s divine presence. Even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil, for He will be with you (Psalm 23:4). In Hebrews 13:5, He promised to never leave you nor forsake you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, acknowledge the Lord as your shepherd in every area of your life. Entrust your life to Him completely, and you will enjoy these blessings and many more. I pray that the Lord will truly manifest Himself in your life, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>When you submit to the Lordship of Jesus, He becomes your light. When the Lord becomes your light, you will have access to hidden mysteries. When others complain about a casting down, you will keep rejoicing because God’s light will show you the way to enjoy a lifting up (Job 22:29). As we see in today’s Bible reading, Isaac enjoyed the light of the Lord. While others were dying in famine, he thrived, flourished, and became very great because God lighted his path and showed him what to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoying God’s light begins with acknowledging and submitting to His Lordship. When God told Isaac to stay where he was during the famine, he did not argue. You cannot enjoy God’s light when you walk in the light of your own fire. Isaiah prophesied about people who walk in the light of their own fires:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow. </strong></i>Isaiah 50:11</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking in the light of your own fire means doing things your way and leaning on your own understanding. Proverbs 3:5 says you should not lean on your own understanding. Those who lean on their understanding eventually end up being sorrowful because they will later realise that the way they thought was right was actually wrong (Proverbs 14:12).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the Lord is your light, you will walk in the way that is right, not in the way that seems right. He will show you the way you should walk in and lead you in the paths of righteousness (Psalm 23:3). As your light, the Lord will lead you in the way that you should go and guide you with His eyes because you are His responsibility (Psalm 32:8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You cannot remain in the dark about the enemy’s plans when the Lord is your light. In Acts 23:12-22, Paul was in prison, and some people conspired to kill him. They made the perfect plan to deceive the chief captain of the prison by telling him that they just wanted to ask Paul some questions, but their real plan was to kill him. However, God arranged for Paul’s nephew to overhear their evil plot, and he exposed them. When God is your light, He will expose the enemy’s plans and keep you safe from every evil plot.</p>",

In John 16:33, Jesus said, “…In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” When we make Jesus our Lord, we are assured of peace and safety amidst terrible storms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our Bible reading for today, Paul was on his way to Rome on a ship with two hundred and seventy-six passengers. When they got to a place called The Fair Havens, Paul perceived there would be danger on the way and told the people on the ship:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>…Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</strong></i> Acts 27:10</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you make Jesus your Lord, He will warn you beforehand of some storms. Whenever you sense something wrong about a particular move you are about to make or a decision you are about to take, that might be Jesus trying to shield you from a storm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Paul did not have experience or a special degree in sailing ships, the captain decided to ignore his words of caution. Sometimes, God will send the instruction that will bring you peace through people you least expect such from. People who always expect God to manifest Himself to them in a spectacular manner often miss Him because He often chooses to express Himself with simplicity. Because the captain refused to listen to Paul, he sailed the ship straight into a terrible storm that almost claimed the lives of everyone on board. They lost many possessions and couldn't eat for many days because they lost hope. However, Paul, who knew the Lord as His peace, encouraged them even though they had earlier disregarded his counsel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</strong></i> Acts 27:23-25</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when the Lord is your peace, He will rescue you from every storm and ensure that nothing is missing or broken in your life. When you make the Lord your peace, He will calm your heart, even in the midst of the trials and challenges of life.</p>",

Psalm 84:5 says, “Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.” When people are complaining of tiredness and weakness, a fellow who has made Jesus Christ his or her Lord will keep going from strength to strength.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.</strong></i> Psalm 84:7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a child of God, every time you come before Him, He gives you a greater dose of strength than the one you had before. Nobody appears before God and leaves weak and weary. If you come before God discouraged, you will leave encouraged. If you come tired, you will leave strengthened. God’s presence supplies endless strength to weary hearts. In areas where you are weak, your Lord will make His strength available to you if you wait on Him. Isaiah 40:29-31 says:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another way God strengthens His children is by sending good news their way so that their hearts will be filled with joy.

      "<p>When you make Jesus your Lord, you will enjoy divine preservation. Today’s Bible reading says that He who keeps Israel neither sleeps nor slumbers. When God keeps a fellow, nothing and nobody can harm him or her (Romans 8:31).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, one of my daughters was serving the Nigerian government in Port Harcourt, a state capital in Southern Nigeria, as part of the mandatory national youth service programme for graduates of tertiary institutions. At that time, a new highway had just been constructed along the route leading to Port Harcourt from Lagos, and vehicles would drive on it at breakneck speeds because the road was really smooth. One day, she was travelling from Lagos to Port Harcourt and she sat at the back of a public vehicle. Suddenly, the car’s front tyre ruptured, and the car began to somersault due to its speed. She shouted, “Jesus!” as the car somersaulted the first time, and unseen hands picked her up from the vehicle through the window and sat her down by the highway. She watched the car somersault five more times before it stopped. People rushed to the scene and saw her sitting by the highway. When they asked her how she got there and she told them she was in the car that had just had an accident, they couldn’t believe her. This is what happens when the Lord puts His angels on guard over your life at all times (Psalm 91:11).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the Lord is your keeper, He will keep your foot from being moved (Psalm 121:3). When people are complaining about the state of the economy, for instance, you won’t be moved because the Lord is your keeper. Only Christians who have made Jesus their Lord and Saviour will have no worries in the midst of dangerous situations, like Daniel in the den of hungry lions. God sent His angel to shut the mouths of the lions and prevented them from harming Daniel because he had made God his Lord, and he was God’s responsibility. The next day, those who had made political power their lord were thrown into the same den, and the lions ate them up (Daniel 6:16-24).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who don’t have Jesus as their Lord are open to the devil’s attacks. Have you genuinely surrendered your life to the Lord? If you haven’t, please do so today. I pray that the Lord will keep you in all your ways with His mighty hands, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

When you make Jesus your Lord, He will not only give you a new song, He will become your song. He will not just fill your mouth with laughter, He will become your laughter and the source of your joy. After God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and led them through the Red Sea, they began to sing a new song to the Lord:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.</strong></i> Exodus 15:2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God becomes your song, He will fill your mouth with joy and laughter.

However, when she encountered Jesus, she was set free immediately. There are some sicknesses that even the best doctors cannot treat. If you are experiencing any lingering sickness, you need just one touch from the Great Deliverer to make you whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the devil afflicts a fellow with an infirmity, he adds a lot of sorrowful things to the person’s life. For example, besides suffering from leprosy, lepers also suffer isolation, which might lead to depression, especially if they are abandoned by their relatives and friends. If they had thriving businesses, the businesses might automatically shut down because some people might not want to do business with them. In Luke 17:12-19, there were ten lepers who needed to be delivered from leprosy. When the Mighty Deliverer came on the scene, they were cleansed, and one of them, who returned to give thanks, was made whole. I believe this meant that he recovered everything he had lost in the past. This is what the Lord can do for you when He is your deliverer. He can restore everything the enemy might have stolen from you as if he never came near you at all.

He can fix anything that is affecting your present as a result of mistakes you made in the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of my students while I was still a lecturer at the University of Lagos, came to me some years ago. He had a problem – he was always sweating, and his sweat smelled terribly. Nobody could sit close to him because of how bad he smelled. Different doctors had prescribed different soaps and medications to him, but the problem persisted. I was about to pray for him when God said, “No, don’t pray; he needs to make a restitution.” I told him what God said, and He made the required restitution. After the restitution, he returned to me so I could pray for him, but God said, “There is no need; just tell him not to drink cold water for two weeks.” That was the end of the problem. Medical doctors could never have resolved this problem, but the One who is the Very Present Help went to his past, turned the situation around, and gave him a testimony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we say that God is very present, it means that there is nothing happening in the present that He is not aware of. It also means that He knows the best way to handle situations in the present. God’s help is always very present to those who have surrendered their lives to Him. Isaiah 65:24 says, <i><strong>“And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.”</strong></i> This means that even before you discover that you need help, the Very Present Help has gone ahead of you to provide solutions. I pray that you will experience more of God’s accurate and prepared help from now henceforth, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must, however, add that if you have not totally surrendered your life to Jesus, you cannot access His very present help. Do not be like people who boast of a past relationship with God and expect Him to help them in the present. If you are riding on past glory, it is time to renew your commitment to God. When you do this, you will then begin to enjoy His very present help.</p>",

Next year, I will be part of it.” He then put his hand in his pocket, brought out an envelope, and said, “In the meantime, let me support the church with this token.” I prayed for him, and he left. When I opened the envelope, I saw that it contained 1,000 naira. I said to myself, “Thank God. We have 1,000 naira down and 4,000 naira to go.” Shortly after, the leaders of the youths in the church came to me in the office and gave me an envelope. I prayed for them, and they left. I opened the envelope, and it contained 2,000 naira. Not long after, I sent for my wife and gave her the 5,000 naira she had earlier requested because God miraculously provided another 2,000 naira.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Psalm 61, the Psalmist cried that God should lead him to a rock higher than him. God’s word is the rock that hides us from trouble and shame. Beloved, you can never be stranded when you put your hope in God’s word. When you put your total trust in His word, He will hide you in His secret place and ensure you are never put to shame.</p>",

      "<p>Every true child of God is a shining light. You are the light of the world, and Matthew 5:16 says, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” Light has one clear duty: shining. This means that anything that stops light from shining is its enemy. As a child of God, anything that stops you from shining is your enemy, and you must deal with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anything that allows darkness to gain the upper hand over light in a believer’s life is an enemy. In today’s memory verse, Jesus identified an object that can keep our light from shining and allow darkness to rule over light – a bushel. A bushel is typically a wooden bucket that was used for measuring dry goods such as peas or grains in the past. If someone lights a lamp in a dark room and puts it under a bushel, it will be impossible to tell that there is light anywhere in that room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most dangerous bushels that has hidden the light of many believers is unforgiveness. The dangerous thing about unforgiveness is that it comes as just one bushel, but it multiplies itself into many other bushels that cover a believer’s light and keep it from shining. Unforgiveness always comes with bitterness, grudges, anger, and resentment. When someone offends you and you decide not to forgive the person, before long, you will find yourself resenting the person and refusing to speak amicably with him or her. Unforgiveness also hinders prayers from getting answered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. </strong></i>Mark 11:25-26</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t toy with unforgiveness; it hides a person’s light and plunges the unforgiving person into darkness. When Jesus told the parable of the unforgiving servant in today’s Bible reading, He revealed the end of those who do not forgive – they are handed over to tormentors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you been hiding your light under the bushel of unforgiveness? It is time to kick it away and let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven (Matthew 5:16). I pray that God will be glorified through your words and actions, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

Throughout his lifetime, he continually had encounters with water. God used him to perform several miracles with water, including: changing water to blood (Exodus 7:20), parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21), turning bitter water to sweet water (Exodus 15), and bringing water out of the rock (Exodus 17).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Names are important; this is why God had to change the names of some people in the Bible so that their destinies could be fulfilled. My mother told me that on her way to see a priest concerning my baptismal name, the name she had in mind was Elisha. However, by the time she got to the priest, she had forgotten the name, so she told him that she would name me Enoch. When she shared this story with me, I told her that I would keep the two names – Elisha, who had a double portion of the anointing, and Enoch, the man who walked with God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The names people are called are important to their destinies, but there is a name that is greater than all names, and that name is JESUS. In Philippians 2:9-11, the Bible says,<i><strong> “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Psalm 118:10-13, David revealed the secret to his victory. He said that when the nations compassed him about, he destroyed them in the name of the Lord. He understood the power in the name of the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, is there anything troubling you as a child of God? Does it have a name? If it does, I congratulate you because you have just defeated it. As long as it has a name, there is a name above it. Even if doctors can’t find a name for anything that might be troubling you medically and they say that all they can see from their diagnosis is ‘nothing’, that is still a name, and when you trust in the name of the Lord, you will always be victorious. Call on the name of the Lord today, and He will give you victory over anything that is troubling you.</p>",

      "<p>Today’s Bible reading is a sad story with many important lessons. It is a sad story because many people died avoidable deaths by joining a rebel to gang up against Moses, the man of God. The Bible reading begins by telling us that Korah and two brothers, Dathan and Abiram, came together to confront Moses. If you study the story carefully, you will see that the rebellion began with Korah because in many verses of the chapter, the words ‘Korah and his company’ were used. Just one man started a rebellion that killed about fifteen thousand people. Rebellion is deadly!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The story might have played out differently if the other people mentioned in the chapter had refused to join Korah in the rebellion when he approached them. They should have discouraged him from being rebellious and counselled him to honour Moses. God can speak to anyone, but He doesn’t choose everyone to lead His people or be at the forefront of His move. If Korah had understood the sacred office that Moses occupied, maybe he wouldn’t have incited a rebellion against him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, there are also rebels in the body of Christ. They think that they know more than the spiritual leaders God placed over them and often believe that they should be at the forefront of what God is doing. If God has not called you into a particular office in His church, don’t try to bring those who occupy such offices down. Also, don’t try to operate in an office that God has not called you into because you will only expose yourself to danger. King Uzziah became leprous because he tried to function in an office God had not called him into (2 Chronicles 26:16-21). When people rebel against God’s ordained hierarchy, they become stranded in life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We live in a generation where some young people think they have enough revelation from God’s word to speak against the spiritual elders in the church. When some of them have a large social media following, they begin to think that they have attained a notable spiritual height and can say anything they like to anyone. Popularity and social media followership are, however, not the same as spiritual authority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if there are rebels around you, run far away from them so that you do not partake in their judgement. Also, if you have been speaking disrespectfully against those that God has given the authority to lead the church, repent now. Rebellion is dangerous, and it never profits anyone.</p>",

      "<p>God created the world by speaking it into existence, as we see in today’s Bible reading. The earth was in a terrible shape; it was void and covered in darkness. Amid this chaos, God called forth light to shine out of the darkness, and His creative work began. Hebrews 11:3 says, <i><strong>“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.”</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything that we see was created by the power of God’s word. There is creative power in the word of God. This is why, as a child of God, when challenges come your way, you do not complain. Rather than complain, you should put the word of God on your lips and speak His will into existence. No matter the kind of obstacles that are hindering God’s will from being manifested in your life, He wants you to speak and command them to move out of the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. </strong></i>Zechariah 4:7</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The authority to speak to mountains is not exclusively for ministers of God. Rather, it is for every genuine child of God. This means that, if you are a child of God and you command the mountains that are contrary to God’s will in your life to disappear in Jesus’ name, they will obey. The Bible says in Philippians 2:9-10 that at the mention of the name of Jesus, every knee in heaven, on earth, or underneath the earth, should bow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some Christians speak to their mountains, but they say the wrong things. Instead of commanding a mountain to be removed, they plead with it for mercy or complain about it. When God says, ‘Speak to the mountain’, He wants you to address it squarely. However, you must get rid of doubt so you can speak authoritatively to that mountain. James 1:6 says:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, doubt robs believers of their authority, and you must not permit it in your heart. Believe in the absolute power of God’s word without any doubt, and no mountain will be able to stand before you.</p>",

The prophet instructed him to do something he felt was way below his status – he was to dip himself seven times in River Jordan, a river he considered to be way below other prestigious rivers in his home country. Angrily, Naaman rejected Elisha’s instruction and was already on his way back to Syria when one of his servants counselled him to obey the prophet’s instructions. Thank God he heeded his servant’s counsel and did as Elisha had instructed. He was cured of his leprosy immediately, and his skin became like that of a newborn. If he had rejected his servant’s simple advice, he would have had to live the rest of his life as a leper. The greatest miracle of your life might be tied to hearing and obeying godly counsel. It is important to never ignore godly counsel, no matter the age or status of the person or people giving the counsel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. </strong>Proverbs 11:14</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>n today’s Bible reading, Jethro travelled to the wilderness to visit Moses, his son-in-law. During his visit, he observed how Moses attended to every single issue that arose in the camp of the Israelites all by himself from morning to night, such that at the end of every day, he was always exhausted. After making this observation, Jethro counselled Moses on what to do. He told him to choose rulers of different ranks from among the people who could also judge matters that arose within the camp. Although Jethro didn’t have the burning bush experience that Moses had, Moses listened to him and received God’s counsel through him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. </strong>James 4:6</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Humility or meekness is an ingredient for receiving God’s grace. You need a meek heart to properly discern when God is speaking through someone and receive what He has to say to you through them. Moses was known as the meekest man on earth (Numbers 12:3), and his meekness was what made him able to receive counsel from people who seemed not to have attained his spiritual height and influence.

They are one, yet they are three distinct entities. I’ll explain it this way: I am one man called Adeboye, but I can express myself differently in different situations. For example, if my wife breaks a ceramic plate, I will be gentle Adeboye; I will speak gently to her and ensure that she is fine. However, if it is my son, I could be furious Adeboye because I might be angry with him for being careless. I am the same person, but I’ll show different sides of myself depending on what is needed in different situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is one. However, He chooses to express Himself in three different forms. Water can be in liquid, gas (steam), or solid form (ice) based on changes in its temperature. In the same vein, God is one God, and He chooses to express Himself as the Holy Spirit when needed, the Word when needed, and the Father when needed. One expression is not less God than the other, just as ice or steam is not less water than its liquid form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God the Father is the side of God that is fatherly. However, just like Adeboye the father, which I described in the first paragraph, He can be strict in this form. During the dispensation of the Father in the Old Testament, people got immediate judgment for their sins. God the Son, who is Jesus Christ, came in the flesh, so as Hebrews 4:15 says, He has feelings just like us, and He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). He is the most relatable to us as He has gone through the temptations we are currently going through, and He advocates for us with the Father (1 John 2:1). God the Spirit is the creative side of God. He is the One who lives in you to do the things that were otherwise impossible to you (Romans 8:11, Philippians 4:13, 1 Corinthians 3:16, 1 John 2:27, John 14:26).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, knowing the Trinity will empower you to live above limitations.

The regime of God the Father on the earth was from the beginning to the day of Pentecost. The regime of the Son will be for a thousand years (Revelation 20:1-4). There will be absolute peace during that period because the Prince of Peace will be in charge. Right now, however, we are in the regime of the Holy Spirit, which started on the day of Pentecost and is still on to date.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To prosper in a particular regime, you must understand and obey the people in charge. The One who is currently in charge of the affairs of men is the Holy Spirit. Therefore, to succeed in all things, you must know the Holy Spirit and be intimate with Him. Being intimate with the Holy Spirit does not mean that you are downgrading or ignoring the Son or the Father. In today’s memory verse, Jesus said that the Holy Spirit will glorify Him and show us things concerning Him. Once you become intimate with the Holy Spirit, you will praise God the Father the way you should, glorify the Son the right way, pray the right way, and study God’s word the right way. When you become a friend of the Holy Spirit, you have automatically become a friend of the Trinity. You can become intimate with the Holy Spirit by speaking His language often and asking Him to fill you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that being able to perform miracles is not evidence that a fellow is intimate with the Holy Spirit. Galatians 5:16-17 says that the flesh and the spirit are always in constant battle against each other. A fellow has become intimate with the Holy Spirit when he or she no longer walks in the flesh but according to the dictates of the Spirit. The people around such a fellow will testify to it when they start seeing the fruit of the Spirit at work in him or her. Jesus said in Matthew 7:16-20 that you will know a tree by the kind of fruit it produces. If the Holy Spirit is indeed your friend, you will produce good fruits that confirm your intimacy with Him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, cultivate an intimate fellowship with the Holy Spirit; He will protect and preserve you.

Before He spoke, the Spirit of God moved over the face of the earth. This means that God speaks whenever the Holy Spirit is in operation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to hear from God, the Holy Spirit must be in operation around you. Once you know how to stir Him in you, you will constantly hear from Him. I hear from God frequently when I am preaching because usually, before I step on any altar to minister, the congregation would have spent some time worshipping God. Then, when I step on the altar, I would continue to worship and eulogise God. When I am done, and it is time to preach, the Spirit of God would have saturated the entire place, and He would begin to speak to me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ministers who do not hear from God will struggle because hearing from God makes ministering easy. God will tell you what and what not to do so that you won’t waste your time and resources. For example, if I want to host a crusade in a particular location, I would ask Him, “Daddy, should I go?” If He says, “No,” then I know that going there would be a waste of time. Some ministers go to minister in different places without hearing from God first. However, when they suffer all kinds of hardships and unnecessary persecutions, they will claim that they are suffering for Jesus. Some will say that since the Bible instructs believers to preach the gospel to all nations, they will build a church in a particular location, even though they did not ask God about it and He did not specifically instruct them to. At the end of the day, they might end up lacking the required funds to run the church and they will begin to look for people they can manipulate into giving them money.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, hearing from God and obeying His voice will always keep you at the centre of His plan and provision. Even when things get difficult, as long as you are operating in His will, He will carry you through. Consistently create an atmosphere for Him to operate in your life, and He will always lead you into higher realms of His grace and glory.</p>",

      "<p>Today’s memory verse tells us that anyone who is a sheep in God’s pasture should hear His voice frequently. When you hear from God, He will guide you in all your ways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, during a meeting, some ministers of God had a disagreement on who to vote for between the two major presidential candidates in Nigeria. I was also in the meeting, and I said, “Brethren, has God told you that either of them will be president? Did He tell you if there will even be an election and if the result will be allowed to stand? Has He told you which of the two He wants?” I told them, “As for me, He hasn’t told me yet. I’ve been asking Him who will be president, but He hasn’t answered, which means I have probably been asking the wrong question. I’m going to change my question to ‘Will there be an election, and will the result be accepted?’” Shortly after that meeting, we were having a pastors conference in RCCG, and I told those present that God finally answered me concerning the elections. He said that one of the candidates would win but would not be allowed to rule, and this was exactly what happened. Asking God about situations and waiting on Him to speak will help a Christian to live above confusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One morning, I asked God which route to take to work to avoid being held up in traffic. He said, “You are not leaving the house today.” I began to quote the Bible to the One who wrote it, “Lord, You said that he who will not work should not eat. Your word also says, ‘Seest thou a man diligent in his business, he shall stand before kings and not mean men.’” He insisted, so I said, “Okay. If they fire me, I’m sure You will provide another job.” At that time, I had not listened to the radio, so I didn’t know that a military coup had happened. A short while later, there was chaos in a school in front of my house as parents rushed to pick up their children. That was when I put on my radio and heard what had happened. God’s voice shielded me from the pandemonium that broke out on the streets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, train your spirit to hear God’s voice by spending time in His presence studying His word, worshipping, and waiting on Him. His voice will instruct you in the way you should go and protect you from evil.</p>",

      "<p>When I first got born again, I noticed that each time an altar call was made in church, the pastor would say, “Those who want salvation should come forward. Those who want sanctification and baptism in the Holy Spirit should ask God for it.” At that time, I had never heard a teaching on the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and I wondered what the pastor meant. After some time, I became thirsty for the Holy Spirit; I wanted to really know Him, and I began to read books on the baptism of the Holy Spirit. In time, I became baptised in the Holy Spirit and grew really intimate with Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you become a friend of the Holy Spirit, there is no limit to what God can do through you. While I was reading about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, today’s Bible reading really caught my attention. The angel told Mary that she would have a son, and Mary asked a very important question, “How can I conceive when I am a virgin?” The angel then said, “The Holy Ghost will come upon you,” and he ended his statement with, “For with God, nothing shall be impossible.” Seeing this, I realised that if the Holy Ghost comes upon me and overshadows me, then nothing would be impossible for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, to live a life of holiness even when you are surrounded by so many temptations, you need the Holy Ghost. You also need the Holy Ghost for impossibilities to become possible in your life. When I read about how the Holy Spirit came upon Mary, I knew that I had to become intimate with the Holy Ghost in order to do exploits for God. Therefore, I got baptised in the Holy Ghost and began to speak His language. Then, He began to do seemingly impossible things for the spread of the gospel and the expansion of God’s Kingdom through me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. </strong>Acts 1:8</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you make the Holy Ghost your friend, you will become empowered to do exploits and take the gospel to the ends of the earth. Make up your mind to become more and more intimate with Him every day.</p>",

When you are intimate with the Holy Spirit, He will cause you to be enlightened beyond your level of education. You might read the same materials that other people read, but the knowledge and insights you will get from those same materials will be far more than what they get.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you study your Bible, the Holy Spirit will illuminate the word of God to you beyond your level of intelligence. Many ministers find it difficult to retain their members because they are unable to feed them with the real word of God. In some cases, by the time some of these ministers are halfway through reading the Bible text for their sermons, their members already know what they will say, how they will start, and how they will end. The only way you can get something new from the word of God every day is when the Holy Spirit teaches you Himself. He is the only One who is capable of giving you fresh revelation from the Scriptures daily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I study the Bible, I usually read a chapter, then I ask the Holy Spirit which verse we will dwell on out of the entire passage. He will often show me the verse, and then I will ask Him to teach me from that verse, and He will. However, one day, I was reading Matthew 10, and after I read verse 1, and while reading verse 2, He said to me, “Stop. We are going to discuss verse 2 today.” I looked at the verse: <strong>“Now the names of the twelve apostles are these…”</strong> I couldn’t imagine how there could be something to learn from that verse, so I said, “Lord, I can’t see anything to dwell on here.” He told me, “Read it again.” I read it again and again. By the time I was reading it the third time, light had broken out, and I had begun to see what the Holy Spirit wanted me to see. I will discuss what the Holy Spirit showed me in Matthew 10:2 tomorrow because I can write an entire book from that verse alone now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you want to become smarter and more intelligent every day, you need to get more intimate with the Holy Spirit.

      "<p>Yesterday, I mentioned that I would discuss what I learned from Matthew 10:2, so I will focus on this verse for the next few days. The verse says,<strong> “…The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;”</strong> The question is, why was Andrew listed second even though he encountered Christ first (John 1:40-41)? Normally, if I were to arrange the list of apostles by their first encounter with Jesus, I would say the first is Andrew, the second is Peter, and so on. This makes me believe that the verse lists the apostles by Jesus’ intended hierarchy. However, as time went on, Andrew dropped from number two, such that he was not even among the first three apostles. Whenever Jesus wanted to go somewhere special, He would go with Peter, James, and John. What caused Andrew to be demoted?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you read through the Bible, you will not find a single flaw about Andrew. Some of the other apostles had flaws: Peter denied Jesus thrice, and James and John wanted to call fire down from heaven to destroy an entire town that did not welcome Jesus (Luke 9:51-54). Despite this, it seemed that Andrew got demoted. However, the Lord told me that Andrew was not demoted; instead, he was promoted. The Lord told me that when Jesus informed the mother of James and John that only His Father will determine those who will sit on His right and left, He meant that the seats were already reserved. The Lord then further whispered to me that one of those seats has been reserved for Andrew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What happens behind the scenes is usually greater than what happens in the limelight. While most people focus on the stage, the real work and benefits are usually behind the scenes. You may not know it, but the producers of successful movies, who are behind the scenes, usually earn more and are more respected than the actors in the limelight. They also don’t have to deal with the distractions and pressures that come with fame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t be desperate for public recognition and the approval of others. Your main focus should be on fulfilling God’s will for your life in whatever capacity He has placed you. God rewards based on faithfulness and obedience, not on fame or perceived influence. I pray that God will reward you bountifully as you focus solely on pleasing Him (2 Corinthians 5:9).</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I said that Andrew was promoted to being in the background instead of the spotlight. Today, I will continue my discussion on Matthew 10:2 by sharing a few questions God asked me when I was studying the verse. He asked, “What part of a building carries the biggest burden?” I answered, “The foundation”. He asked again, “What part of the building is unseen?” I responded, “The foundation”. He continued, “If the building is burnt down, what part of it escapes the fire?” I answered, “The foundation”. Finally, He asked, “When there is a storm, what part is blown off first?” I answered, “The roof”. The roof is the part of a building that people usually notice first, and it is the one that is usually blown off first in a storm while the foundation remains intact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People who want to be seen every time are more likely to be blown off by storms. Believers who have an unhealthy desire to be seen and known as the people who make things happen need to pray to God for new hearts so they won't be the first to be blown off when storms come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God often hides people to preserve them. Before John the Baptist began his ministry, he was in the wilderness until the day of his showing unto Israel (Luke 1:80). God hid him until the right time. If John had insisted that he wanted to fulfil all the prophetic words the angel gave his father before the day of his showing, he might have been blown off. Even when Jesus came to the earth as a man, God didn’t announce Him to the whole world immediately. As we read in today’s Bible reading, God instructed Joseph to hide Jesus in Egypt until it was safe to return to Israel. Moses’ mother also hid him for three months until she could no longer hide him from Pharaoh. She put him in a basket and put the basket on the River Nile, and God arranged for the very system that should have killed him to preserve him (Exodus 2:1-10). When people insist on being in the spotlight when God hasn’t permitted them, they expose themselves to the ‘Herods’ and ‘Pharaohs’ who are after their destinies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t get frustrated if it seems you are not operating in the realm of influence that God has promised you. He is faithful to His words and is only preserving you until the right time. Be patient, and put your total trust in Him.</p>",

      "<p>If there is a storm in the jungle, big, tall trees might be uprooted. However, by the time the storm is over, the lowly grass will remain in its position. When strong winds blow, a blade of grass will bow in the direction of the wind, but after the wind blows, it will return to its former posture and remain like that. In life, storms happen every now and then. When a storm comes, many people who have pride in their hearts and consider themselves to be better than everyone else are usually blown off, while the unknown – the meek and lowly – remain and praise God after the storm has passed. Everyone who became proud in the Bible was eventually blown off by one thing or the other. Nebuchadnezzar was blown off his throne for seven years, and he ate grass like an ox because he refused to remain humble (Daniel 4:28-37). Pharaoh lost his army to the Red Sea because he refused to acknowledge God and insisted on stubbornly pursuing God’s people (Exodus 14:28). Pride makes people put themselves in a place where they can be easily destroyed. Beloved, no matter the height you attain in life, it is wise for you to remain humble and avoid becoming a show-off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s memory verse tells us that with pride comes shame, but with the lowly is wisdom. Nobody can access God’s wisdom with a proud heart. When a man becomes proud, he invites shame to visit him. Pride always goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall (Proverbs 16:18). A humble man, however, will enjoy preservation and promotion because humility attracts God’s favour and blessings. Proverbs 29:23 tells us that while a man’s pride brings him low, a humble man will be upheld by honour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pride is very dangerous because it makes people delusional. When they ought to work on themselves to become better, pride will lie to them that they are the best. Instead of seeking or receiving help from others, pride will deceive them that they are self-sufficient and do not need other people. When people allow pride into their hearts, they close the heavens over themselves because God resists the proud and only gives grace to the humble (James 4:6).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, no man can go far without the grace of God. If you want God’s grace in everything you do, clothe yourself with humility and never allow pride into your heart.</p>",

      "<p>Many children of God have fallen into the devil’s trap because they lacked the gift of the discerning of spirits. Usually, the messengers that the devil sends to believers appear as angels of light (2 Corinthians 11:14). They usually seem harmless and very likeable, such that believers let their guards down around them and put their trust in them. By the time such believers realise that they are dealing with the devil’s agents, major damage would have been done, and they would have lost ground to the devil where their destiny is concerned. However, if such believers have the gift of the discerning of spirits, they will get an inward witness, warning them about the devil’s agents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some Christian ladies have married occultic men who disguised themselves as born-again Christians because they did not have the gift of the discerning of spirits. Likewise, some believers have engaged in businesses with the wrong people because they lacked the gift of the discerning of spirits. Christian employers should not only look at the qualifications of the people they intend to employ; they should also be sensitive to discern the kind of spirits they carry so they do not impact their organisations negatively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1980, I attended the wedding ceremony of one of my three close friends at the time. When I got to the venue, one of the other two friends welcomed me warmly and was doing everything to make me comfortable by offering me all kinds of drinks, food, and souvenirs. Suddenly, I heard God say, “He is your enemy.” I was shocked because I was really close to him and thought I knew him so well. However, I started treading carefully around him from that day on.

      "<p>The gift of the discerning of spirits helps Christians to identify the kind of spirits operating in the lives of people they come in contact with. For example, a believer who has the gift of the discerning of spirits will be able to tell when he or she comes across a person who is not a child of God but is pretending to be filled with the Holy Spirit. With the gift of the discerning of spirits, believers are equipped to identify those who are wolves in sheep’s clothing around them. God intends that this gift play a vital role in the lives of believers, and it becomes heightened with greater intimacy with Him; unfortunately, many believers do not seem to appreciate its importance. You must note, however, that the gift of the discerning of spirits is not the spirit of discernment, as many people erroneously call it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, Paul and Silas were on a very important assignment to tell the people of Philippi about Jesus when a demon-possessed girl met them. Everything she said about them was accurate; however, if Paul did not have the gift of the discerning of spirits, he might have put her in front of their evangelistic campaign or even made her the head of the evangelism team based on the things she said. However, Paul saw beyond her words and was able to identify that they were sponsored by an evil spirit, which he eventually cast out of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the gift of the discerning of spirits is vital for all Christians; however, it is even more critical for ministers of God to operate in it. This is because agents of the devil can sometimes sneak into the gathering of believers by pretending to be children of God (2 Corinthians 11:14). In such cases, ministers of the gospel must seek them out because they are not among the congregation of saints to have fun; they are there to slow down the work of God and extinguish the fire of God that is burning in the midst of the congregation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must not be caught off guard by demonic operations around you. If you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ and do not have the gift of the discerning of spirits yet, ask God for it today so you can recognise and deal with the forces of darkness appropriately. Tomorrow, I will talk about how to deal with witches and wizards, especially within a church setting.</p>",

      "<p>Over the past two days, I have established that you need the gift of the discerning of spirits to determine the kinds of spirits controlling the people around you. This is very important because for you to be able to deal with witches or wizards, you must first be able to identify them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you recognise witches or wizards around you, your first reaction shouldn’t be to confront them or send them away. A popular saying where I come from goes: “Once God has shown you your enemy, that enemy can no longer kill you.” Once you discover witches or wizards, do not even let them know about your discovery because the moment they know that you have discovered them, they will find alternative ways to attack. Once the devil knows that a pastor has discovered his agents among a congregation, for instance, he will replace them with new ones, and the pastor must discover the new agents with the help of the Holy Spirit all over again. However, if the pastor keeps quiet about his or her discovery and just takes the right actions as directed by the Holy Spirit to ensure they do not carry out their evil plans, there will be no damage done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you notice witches or wizards around you, thank God for the revelation and seek His face to know the exact steps to take to handle them. You must ask God for the grace to be spiritually sensitive at all times so that beyond detecting them, you will also be able to know when they plan to execute their evil plans and what you must do to stop them. During one of the annual RCCG conventions, I overheard in the spirit realm that one witch was telling another one, “It is time to strike.” In those days, I wasn’t as mature as I am now, so I was always ready to call down fire at any time. Therefore, when I heard that, I called the witches forward, and one of them said, “I didn’t want to do it; it is the thing within me that was pushing me,” while the other one was weeping. God set them free that day. Thank God I was sensitive to the revelation from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must live a holy life dedicated to constant fasting and prayers so you can stay sensitive to the Holy Spirit and know what to do to disarm and deal with satanic agents.</p>",

      "<p>My father, who was a farmer, would always separate the best fruits after a harvest so he could plant their seeds in the next planting season. This is because the quality of the seeds a farmer plants is a major determinant of the quality of his or her harvest. A seed may seem small and insignificant, but it decides the kind of fruit a tree will produce. In the same vein, a child may seem small and unimportant in the scheme of things at the moment, but the kind of adult the child becomes will shape the future of the family’s lineage. Therefore, how parents raise their children matters much more than the material things they give them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, an angel appeared to Manoah’s wife and told her she would give birth to a son. Her husband was not with her at the time; however, when he heard what the angel told his wife, he prayed that God would give him his own encounter. God answered his prayer, and when he saw the angel himself, he asked an important question:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him? </strong>Judges 13:12</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Manoah was a very wise father who wanted to know how to order and direct the child that God was about to bless them with so that everything God had said concerning the child would come to pass. Every parent must ask God for direction if they want to raise their children in the way they should go (Proverbs 22:6). Some parents train their children the same way they were trained and complain that the children are not responding to their training. There is a way to ‘order’ every child, but parents cannot find it without getting acquainted with the One who made the child. Farmers know that some soils are best for some seeds, but if you take that same seed to another type of soil, it will either not bear fruits or grow at all. For instance, a plant like the cactus can thrive in the desert, but if you plant a water lily in the desert, it will dry up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God knows the best way to train a child in the way he or she should go. If you are a parent, ask God for the manual on how to train your children so you won’t raise them in a way that is contrary to how He made them.</p>",

There were many VIPs there – heads of state, diplomats, top government officials, and the like. At the end of my sermon, I made an altar call. Later, someone called my son and asked, “What kind of pastor is your father, making altar calls at a state wedding?” I explained to my son that the reason I accepted the invitation was because I wanted to win souls for God. Many of the VIPs at the wedding were not Christians, and I saw it as an opportunity for them to hear God’s word.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The greatest good anyone can do for humanity is to win souls for Christ. If you do this, you are automatically making the world a better place. Genuine Christians don’t rob banks, so if you win souls, the rate of robbery will reduce. Genuine Christians don’t lie and steal, so if you win souls, there will be less corruption in the society. If you refuse to win souls for Christ, the society will only get worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a genuine Christian runs for a political office and the voters are all corrupt, do you think they will let him or her win? Thieves will not come together to vote a policeman into power. Therefore, it is important to convert the unbelievers in the society into believers so that the righteous can rule and the land can be prosperous (Proverbs 14:34). For your society and standard of living to improve, you need to win souls for God, plant churches, and do mighty works for Him. This way, you won't have to worry about politics. If you win your town for Christ, the leaders of the town will be children of God, and Proverbs 29:2 says that when the righteous rule, the people rejoice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A soul winner is a vessel that brings salvation to others. He or she is a giver, a blessing, a co-worker with God, and a divine partner with Him. Being a soul winner has several benefits. When you become a soul winner, you will enjoy greater blessings than just being a Christian who does not bear fruits in God’s kingdom because the Bible says that it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). Soul winning also gives you greater access to answered prayers (John 15:16).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make up your mind to become an ardent soul winner for Christ – it is in your best interest.</p>",

Many times, when He wants to do something, He will ask His children to handle a part of it while He does the rest. In today’s memory verse, He took the animals He had made to Adam for him to name them, and whatever Adam called them became their names. In John 6:5-7, Jesus already knew what He would do, but He still asked the disciples how they could feed over 5,000 people. Eventually, He used the lunch of a little boy that one of His disciples brought to Him to feed the crowd. As mighty as God is, He loves to have His children's input in whatever He wants to do. Unfortunately, however, not many of them are intimate enough with God for Him to ask for their input.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Ezekiel 37:1-10, God took a man to a valley full of dry bones and asked him if the bones could live. When a Christian begins to take his or her relationship with God more seriously, the fellow will not only hear from God but he or she will also start having intimate discussions with Him. Anybody can hear from God, but only a few discuss with Him, and very few become intimate with Him enough for God to ask them, “My son, what do you think we should do in this situation?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, we see that Abraham was so intimate with God that God could not hide His intention to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah from him. If you want God to regularly ask for your input in the things that He wants to do, you must be very intimate with Him. You must become so close to Him that He will say, “I cannot hide what I am about to do from My friend.” It is not enough to only attend church regularly; there is much more to God than you can get by just spending two or three hours in a church service. To be intimate with God, you need to spend time with Him in prayers and read His word daily. When you spend time with Him daily, not only will you get to know more of Him, but He will also request your input on some of the matters that are dearest to Him.</p>",

In Luke 18:9-14, Jesus told the story of two men who went into the temple to pray. One boasted about his achievements before God but was not justified. However, the other man who went humbly before God and acknowledged his helplessness was justified. In today’s world, many people approach God as ‘great people of faith’. However, this is why they pray for so long without getting responses from God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God described the dimensions of the mercy seat in the ark of the covenant to Moses in Exodus 25:17, He specified that its length was to be 2.5 cubits and its breadth was to be 1.5 cubits. Interestingly, God didn’t specify a height. This means that the mercy seat isn’t something to sit on but something to lie upon. Those who will receive God’s mercy must come in their lowest state. When you’re in God’s presence, you must be vulnerable and discuss your weaknesses, problems, feelings, and areas of confusion with Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a difference between discussing and praying. Praying is asking for assistance, while discussing is saying, “Lord, this is me. I have tried this step and that step. What do I do?” If you have this posture in prayer, He will start teaching you things others don’t know. Proverbs 3:7 warns us not to be wise in our own eyes. Some people ask for counsel but have already made up their minds on what to do. Such people aren’t ready to listen to any advice but are only looking to rubber-stamp their decision. People who come to God like this never get anything from Him because they act like they know more than Him. They feel too proud to lay their ideas and strategies before Him and listen to His instructions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, when Moses encountered God in the burning bush, the first thing God asked him to do was to take off his shoes. Beloved, your shoes represent the things that might be stopping you from being vulnerable with God, such as your knowledge and achievements. Take them off before coming to your heavenly Father. He never ignores those who are vulnerable before Him, and His mercy always finds the lowly (James 4:6). I pray that God will extend His grace and help towards you as you humble yourself before Him daily, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

Many years ago, I was constantly praying about church growth, and I attended many conferences. I tried everything I was taught in those conferences, but nothing happened. In fact, it came to a point where we were practically begging people with food to come to church – we called it Care Fellowship. People would come, collect the food, and return to their homes, never to be seen again.

Moses reported the matter to God, and God said, “I will give them so much meat that they will be fed up.” The next day, the wind blew and there were quails on the floor all around the camp of the Israelites. Sometimes, when you read about the wind in the Scriptures, it is referring to the Holy Spirit. The wind directed millions of quails to the camp of the Israelites such that all they had to do was to pick them up. When God directed me to read this passage after I asked Him about the growth of the church, I told Him, “I don’t understand. What has this got to do with church growth?” He said, “Let the Holy Spirit blow, and people will come; you wouldn’t even need to go looking for them. They will be so many that you won't have room to contain them.” That day, I let go of all my strategies and depended solely on Him, and before long, the church started growing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, give the Holy Spirit complete access to every area of your life.

However, the day you were born is also important because Psalm 90:12 says, <strong>“…teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.” </strong>I replied, “I want every church member to receive a miracle.” Then He said, “Call them together and let them meet with Me for one week. At the end of the week, all of them would have gotten a miracle.” That one week in 1986 is one we can never forget in RCCG because God’s power was so mighty in our midst that we experienced many jaw-dropping miracles which have been happening more frequently to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God is always asking you for what you want. Even if He does not ask you directly as He did with me, He can ask you by presenting two options before you, and your choice can determine the rest of your life. When God asks you for what you want, you will ask for material things that will fade quickly if your mind has always been on material things. In today’s Bible reading, Esau did not know that God was indirectly testing him when he returned from his hunt hungry. When Jacob asked him to sell his birthright for a plate of food, he did not consider the choices before him; all he wanted was to fill his belly with food. Esau had enough energy to ask Jacob for food, and this implies that he really wasn’t at the point of death, so if he had refused Jacob’s offer, he would not have died. However, he accepted Jacob’s offer and despised his birthright because his mind was focused on material things. In today’s memory verse, he was called a fornicator and a profane person because he chose a material thing over something eternal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you will be faced with choices every day, and the choices you make today will determine the quality of your life tomorrow. What choices are you making today? If God gives you a blank cheque to ask for what you want, what will you ask for? Will you ask for things that fade away, like Esau, or things that are beneficial to fulfilling your glorious destiny in God?

      "<p>Many self-acclaimed prophets prophesy by sight. They might look at a fellow, guess what he or she wants to hear, and say it with a serious countenance; that is guesswork, not prophecy. Some look at the sky, and when they observe that the clouds are dark, they prophesy that it will rain. Someone once prophesied that it would rain in Nigeria in June. I heard about the prophecy and thought to myself, “June is in the middle of the rainy season; if it doesn’t rain in June, when else would it rain?” That was a prophecy by sight. Real prophecies are, however, not based on physical observations; they are based on what God reveals in the realm of the spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most times, when God gives a prophecy, it will not make sense to the human mind because nothing in the physical will support what God is saying. In fact, many times, the one God gives the prophecy through might be afraid to say it because of how unlikely it is – humanly speaking – for what God has said to come to pass. If God gives you a prophecy and asks you to share it, do not be afraid to speak; rest assured that whatever you say will come to pass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, there was a severe famine in Samaria for seven years. The famine was so bad that women began to eat their children (2 Kings 6:25-30). Amid this hardship, God’s word came through Elisha:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>…Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. </strong>2 Kings 7:1</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By all economic metrics, what Elisha said sounded illogical and practically impossible. That did not matter, however, because God brought His word to pass. Isaiah 55:10-11 says:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not despise prophecies from genuine ministers of God because they sound illogical or impossible. Inasmuch as the messages are from God, He will surely bring them to pass.</p>",

      "<p>Some people who have received a measure of God’s power use it wrongly. For example, simply because people fall under the anointing during their ministrations, some ministers of God want to touch people just to show that they are anointed. Some even perform different acrobatics during deliverance sessions. Some of them give demon-possessed people microphones so that people can hear what the demons are saying. All of these are unnecessary and wrong. Ministers of God should simply cast demons out of people to set them free; they shouldn’t embarrass the people they are trying to deliver because they want to show that they are anointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The power of God isn’t a tool for punishment but for bringing joy to the hearts of people. When God gives you a measure of His power, it is for you to give life to dead things and bring glory to Him, not for you to show off or seek personal gain or vengeance. It is possible to destroy and kill with the power God has given to you; however, that is not what it is meant for. This is why most mature believers are usually slow to speak and try not to get angry no matter what people do to them. They don’t want to ever use the power of God for evil. When God gives you a measure of His power, you are not to go around destroying people you consider to be enemies. Ephesians 6:12 says:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A vessel in satan’s hands today can become a great vessel in God’s hands tomorrow. If God could use Mary Magdalene, who had seven demons in her, He can use anyone who is considered evil. If Stephen had called death upon Saul as he was being executed under Saul’s supervision, there would never have been an Apostle Paul. Paul said in today’s memory verse that the power of God is for edification, not destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, James and John wanted to call down fire on the Samaritans because they didn’t receive Jesus. However, Jesus told them that He came to save, not to destroy lives. Beloved, God’s will is for everyone to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4); He doesn’t want anyone to perish (2 Peter 3:9). If He has given you a measure of His power, only use it to fulfil His will, not to destroy.</p>",

      "<p>Today, many men are afraid to get married even though they are mature enough, have good jobs or businesses, and are financially stable. Usually, this is because they do not want to marry the wrong ladies as wives. Likewise, many women are hesitant to get married despite being courted by many men because they do not want to make wrong choices when it comes to choosing a life partner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important for Christians to know that once they are married, there is no going back. Marrying the wrong spouse can be hell on earth. Nobody goes on a long journey without adequate preparations, and marriage is a lifelong journey. This is why, if you are not yet married, you need God’s help to make the right decision regarding your partner on this lifelong journey. Some people have rushed into marriage only for them to find out that their partner is self-centred and foolish. Some have chosen spouses by their physical attributes alone and ended up with a physically okay but spiritually deficient partner for their journey. When the journey became tough, their spouses were neither spiritually sensitive nor capable of strengthening their faith. When choosing who to marry, believers must not allow physical attributes to dictate for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samson was a man who was destined to be great. His glorious future was foretold before his birth, and he was truly on a path to greatness before the woman he chose as a partner, Delilah, cut short his destiny. Before then, Samson had compromised his faith in many areas, and he became insensitive to God’s leading. Therefore, he chose to love Delilah based on her physical attributes. Judges 16:4 says that he saw her in the valley of Sorek and loved her; he allowed himself to be enticed by her beauty. A valley is a low place, and if a believer is in a low place spiritually, where the fellow has compromised his or her values and disobeyed God’s principles, such a believer is not in a good place to make marital choices because he or she might make the wrong choice. Such a believer must first return to the Lord and ask Him to restore him or her before thinking about choosing a spouse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are not yet married, God wants to lead you to make the right choice about whom to marry. You must, however, be living in obedience to His words and principles for Him to lead you to make the right choice.</p>",

When the 70 elders began to prophesy, a young man came to tell Moses that two men who were not part of them were also prophesying. On hearing this, Joshua told Moses to stop them. However, Moses replied that he didn’t mind if the Lord put His Spirit on all His people because that was His ultimate will. Moses was a true leader, and true leaders allow their followers to fly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Someone once asked a pastor, “Why don’t you encourage the Holy Ghost baptism among your congregation?” He replied, “Because if they get the power of the Holy Spirit, they will outrun us, their pastors.” This amazed me because my prayer is that my children will be greater than I am. Every time I pray for the pastors in RCCG, I ask God to double the anointing on my life and give it to them because, if that happens, my job will be easier. For example, when a corpse is brought to the church to be raised back to life, wouldn’t it be wonderful if an usher could call the dead person back to life without my intervention or any other pastor’s intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many pastors do almost everything in their churches because they feel they are the only ones who can handle them; such pastors only end up stressing themselves unnecessarily. How can God bring increase to the church if ministers don’t endeavour to raise others to serve God in ministry? When pastors ask God to empower their congregations, and all their members are on fire for God, there will be a great revival, and the ministry will move forward. While it is true that when everyone in a congregation carries a measure of God’s power they may become restless and grow tired of just hearing the pastor preach, a wise pastor won't hold them back. Instead, the pastor should train them and put them in new territories so they can impact others with the anointing they’ve been empowered with. Yes, they might make some mistakes, but with the pastor’s guidance and God’s help, they will succeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you’re a leader in any capacity, seek the growth and empowerment of the people who serve under you because it will make your job easier. In addition, when they become empowered, let them fly.</p>",

Soon, people will see your light and come to the brightness of your rising (Isaiah 60:1-3).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can be very talented; however, if you don’t work hard and use your talent, people won’t take notice. Today’s memory verse says that you should let your light shine for people to see your good works and glorify your heavenly Father. Did you notice the word ‘works’ in that verse? You must work for people to see you. Someone showed me a newspaper article in which a reporter was making a joke about the miracles God has performed in my life. The person who showed me the article said, “Daddy, what’s your comment?” I told him that I had no comment. I don’t have any comments about such jokes because I am too busy doing God’s work, and I can’t be distracted by trivial issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s Bible reading tells the story of a man who was born blind. When Jesus’ disciples started to debate about whose sin caused the man’s predicament, Jesus redirected their attention to what was important. He told them, <strong>“I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.”</strong> Then, He spat on the ground, made some mud out of the clay, anointed the man’s eyes, and told him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam – the blind man returned with brand-new eyes. Jesus went about doing the work of the Father throughout His human ministry; He was so busy doing good that everywhere He went, people took note of Him and followed Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you go about doing the work of the One who sent you, you will become like a city set on a hill that cannot be hidden and a candle on a candlestick that gives light to everyone in a house (Matthew 5:14-15).

If eloquence is required for people to turn to Jesus, the 3,000 people who got saved in Acts 2 would not have cried out to God in repentance because Peter was an ordinary fisherman, and his words were likely to have been unrefined. However, when the Holy Spirit came upon him, the people who heard him were convicted. When they heard his preaching, they were pricked in their hearts and asked what they should do (Acts 2:37). Paul, who was well-educated, knew that he could not save anyone by his preaching alone and that his eloquence could not soften any man’s heart. This is why he said in today’s Bible reading that his speech and preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only the Holy Spirit can soften people’s hearts. He alone can bring light to the darkness in a sinner’s soul. 2 Corinthians 4:4 says that the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers. Satan does not want people to be saved, so he blinds their eyes and keeps them from accepting Jesus. This is why you need the Holy Spirit when you go out to evangelise; He alone can destroy the lies of the devil in the minds of men. Without Him, your preaching will be mere words. People may clap for you because of your eloquence, but their hearts will not be changed, and they will remain hardened in their sins. However, when you are filled with the Holy Spirit, you won’t need to say much before people surrender their hearts to Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you cannot go into a strong man’s house without first binding him (Mark 3:27). To bind the devil and stop his activities in the lives of men, you need the power of the Holy Spirit. Before you preach to people, ask the Holy Spirit to work on their hearts.

They believe that the sermon is the main service; however, this is not true. Worship is actually the major part of the service, which is why a church service is often called a ‘worship service’. Psalm 22:3 says that God inhabits the praises of Israel. Right from the beginning of a church service, God is already moving. Christians who understand this always go to church early because they know that while the praise and worship session is going on, they can hear from God and receive an impartation from Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is unfortunate that many ministers of God do not take praise and worship sessions seriously. When the choir is singing choruses and praising God, many pastors are still sitting in their offices, writing letters and giving instructions because they feel that the main part of the service has not started. By the time they get on the pulpit, the service is almost over because a major part of the service is the praise and worship session. If you worship God well enough, you will see Him in action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When believers know that they can do nothing without God (John 15:5), they will not miss praise and worship sessions for anything. In today’s Bible reading, the Bible tells us that Solomon worshipped God by offering a thousand burnt offerings to Him. It was an act of worship, the kind that the people around him had never seen before. That night, God paid him a visit and told him to ask for anything he wanted. Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge so that he could serve God the way he ought to, and the Bible says that God granted him his request and added other blessings. The Bible also says that before him, there was no one like him, and after him, there will never be anyone like him (2 Chronicles 1:12).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make it a duty to never miss any opportunity to worship God by dancing and singing praises to His name, especially during church services. If you sing and dance for Him regularly, He will set you apart for greatness. However, if you feel you are too big to dance before Him or worship and give Him thanks, He will also see you as being too big to be carried to the top.</p>",

Today, I will discuss prophecies from the human spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a prophecy comes from people’s spirits, they will say things that they sense will happen, but most times, they won’t happen. Many times, a person could get excited and think, in that moment, that he or she has heard from God; however, it could be that the person only heard from his or her human spirit. This is why you must put your emotions in check whenever you want to hear from God so that you won’t hear from your human spirit and assume you heard from God. When you are expecting to hear from God, and your mind is fixed on a particular result that you want, you will likely hear a confirmation of that result from your human spirit and assume that God has spoken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was much younger in ministry and there were signs that I would be travelling frequently on ministerial assignments, an airline offered me some really good packages. I was excited by the offer and prophesied that the airline would prosper and never suffer any disaster. Shortly after my declaration, the airline suffered a plane crash. I could have just prayed for them and blessed them; instead, I prophesied based on my emotions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you do not let go of your emotions and allow God to sincerely search your heart, you will hear the idols of your heart giving you the go-ahead when you approach God for His counsel in prayer. For example, if a young lady is asking God about which one of her suitors is His choice, she needs to control her emotions despite her personal preference and give God total control concerning the matter if she really wants to hear from Him. If she asks God about His choice but discovers that her heart is fixed on the one she likes during her prayers, she should find a neutral person to pray with her because she just might hear from her human spirit telling her to go ahead with her preference. She must also genuinely want to hear from God because today’s memory verse says that if you approach a prophet with idols in your heart, God will answer you according to those idols.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, train your human spirit to totally submit to God so that whenever you need to hear Him, your emotions won’t interfere with His counsel.</p>",

The devil might even misinterpret a portion of the Scriptures to support his lies so that a believer will think that the prophecy is from God. When a prophecy comes from the devil, it is only a matter of time before it produces the fruits of the devil. When Satan gets to a place, he has three assignments: to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). Any prophecy from him will eventually steal from those who believe it, kill their joy and dreams, and destroy their hope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the young girl in Acts 16:16-18 said some prophetic words, they had many elements of truth in them.

The devil knows how to say things and manipulate them to come to pass. Some people hear prophecies from the devil and just ignore them; however, that can be dangerous. There was a very wealthy man who quarrelled with his wife, and she told him that by the time she was ‘done’ with him, he would have to walk to get anywhere within Lagos. When the woman said that, the man laughed because, at that time, he had fourteen cars. Before long, however, he lost all his cars until he had just one left and only 50 kobo in his pocket. He then said to himself, “If I use this 50 kobo to fuel my car, what will I eat? If I buy food with the money, then I will have to walk around Lagos like my wife prophesied.” That was when he came to Jesus Christ, and Jesus began to remedy his situation. On the day he shared his testimony, he dedicated two new houses. I pray for you today that any negative prophecy that might be working against your life and destiny is nullified, in Jesus' name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you must be careful about the people you give permission to speak into your life. If someone speaks something that is contrary to God’s will into your life, plead the blood of Jesus and cancel it immediately.</p>",

      "<p>Today, I will conclude the teaching I started two days ago by examining prophecies that come from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, God told me to wear seven agbadas to one of our programmes, even though He knows I do not like putting on any kind of agbada at all, not to mention wearing seven at a time. Even for those who like to wear agbadas, wearing two at a time, not to talk of seven, will be considered absurd. The instruction was strange, but because I know His voice, I obeyed. Then, He asked me to dance for a while and lay them on the altar afterwards. I obeyed again, and He said, “Let anyone who has a problem touch one of the agbadas. However, they should not hold them.” I relayed the message to the congregation, and many people came forward to touch the agbadas. We finished the service by 8am, and I retreated into my prayer room. Around 5pm, I heard some knocks on the door. When I opened the door, some church members told me, “A man is about to die.” They explained that the man had held on to one of the agbadas, claiming that his problem required more than one touch, and he had been shaking vigorously since then. The clothes looked ordinary, but because God had given instructions concerning them, they were saturated with power. I had to plead with God before the man stopped shaking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A while later, I travelled to the United States for one of our conventions, and God instructed me to take one of the agbadas with me. During the service, I told the congregation that they should only touch the agbada and not hold on to it. A white man in the congregation said, “What kind of nonsense is that?” However, he went forward to touch the garment. The man was wearing an iron brace on his back, which enabled him to stand upright. Immediately he touched the agbada, the iron brace broke to pieces, and he received his healing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when the Holy Spirit speaks, whatever He says will always come to pass. No matter how foolish some utterances may sound, when God is the source, they will not fall to the ground. To hear from God, however, you must relate intimately with the Holy Spirit so you can distinguish between His voice, the voice of the devil, and the voice of your human spirit.</p>",

      "<p>Jesus Christ cast demons out of people during His earthly ministry, and He also charged all Christians to do the same thing:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. </strong>Matthew 10:8</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deliverance, however, is beyond casting out demons. True deliverance happens when a demon is unable to return and repossess a fellow that has been delivered from it. Jesus said in Matthew 12:43-45 that when an evil spirit comes out of a fellow, it wanders around looking for a place to stay. If it doesn’t find a place to stay, it will go back to check if its former home is still empty. If it discovers that the place is empty, it will invite other demons that are more wicked than it, and they will reside in the fellow’s life. The end of such a fellow will then become worse than when he or she was possessed by only one demon. As a child of God, the moment you cast out a demon from someone, see to it that the fellow is filled with the Holy Spirit. If the demon returns and finds that the Holy Spirit already occupies the fellow, it can’t repossess him or her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After Jesus cast seven demons out of Mary Magdalene, she became one of His followers and followed Him until the end of His earthly ministry. The moment the Lord set her free, she became a divine treasure and committed to serving God with all that she had. Her commitment made her one of the first people to see Jesus after he was resurrected (John 20:13-18). In Luke 8:26-39, after Jesus cast the legion of demons out of the madman of Gadara, He told him to go about preaching the gospel. It is not enough for a demon to be cast out of a fellow; the real deliverance is when he or she is filled with the Holy Spirit such that the demon cannot return to repossess the fellow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, true deliverance is when your heart is filled with the Holy Spirit because you pray and feed on the word of God daily, fast regularly, and live a holy life. True deliverance is when a delivered fellow does not return to his or her old lifestyle but rather remains filled by the Holy Spirit such that there cannot be a repossession by demons.</p>",

This is because, at a certain level of greatness, there are things leaders must keep as highly confidential so as to protect themselves, their followers, and the greater good of what they represent. There are some kinds of information that are available to such people that can be misused if they become common knowledge, and as such, they must be kept secret.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God also has secrets, and if you are close to Him and truly reverence Him, He will begin to tell you some of them. However, if you go around telling everyone the things He tells you without His permission to do so, do not be surprised when you stop hearing more secrets from Him. When God tells you something and instructs you not to tell anyone, keep your mouth shut, and He will trust you with even more secrets. I pray that you will get so close to God that He will begin to share some of His secrets with you, in Jesus' name.<br><br>The birth and nurturing of Jesus Christ required a certain level of secrecy, and if Mary had been talkative, she would have exposed Him to danger early in His life.

If He says that they are for your ears only and you must not tell other people, please keep it to yourself.</p>",

      "<p>When you get sufficiently close to God and begin to intercede for other people, God will tell you things about them. Sometimes, you will not need to tell the people you are praying for the things God tells you about them; you can just give them instructions to guide them into God’s will. However, if God leads you to share some things with them, then you must apply wisdom, especially when the messages are negative. You must take a cue from the way Nathan delivered God’s message to David, as we read in today’s Bible reading. If Nathan had just told David, “Thus saith the Lord, because you have taken another man’s wife and killed the man, evil will befall you,” he could have lost his head that day. However, due to the way he presented the message, David got on his knees in repentance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of prophecy is for edification, exhortation, and comfort (1 Corinthians 14:3), not to condemn or show everyone that you can hear from God. If your prophecy does not edify, exhort, or comfort the one you are prophesying to, you are likely delivering the message wrongly. Even when Elijah was direct in passing judgment on Ahab because God specifically told him what to say (1 Kings 21:17-29), Ahab repented because the purpose of the prophecy was not to condemn him, but to bring him to repentance, as God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that there will be times when, even though you deliver God’s message in the right manner, the people who receive the message might still not do the will of God. You can’t force people to do God’s will; your major responsibility is to deliver God’s message. It is up to the recipients of the message to either believe God’s prophet and prosper or not (2 Chronicles 20:20). Sometimes, God might even allow the hearts of the recipients to be hardened as He did with Pharaoh (Exodus 9:12) so that in future, others will take His word more seriously.<br><br>Beloved, Ephesians 4:15 tells us to speak the truth in love. This means that if God wants you to give others a message, you must allow His love to guide whatever you say. It is best to ask God to fill your heart with wisdom and love before you speak so that your words will not do more harm than good.</p>",

I am confident that you will overcome any financial challenge you may be facing right now because your Father will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is worthy of note that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job, and other patriarchs in the Bible were all very wealthy.

This is how some Christians today are begging people for things that they can easily get from the Almighty God, their Father. Note that when the prodigal son departed from his father’s house initially, everything seemed to be going well. However, things soon took a turn for the worse, and he realised that he had made a mistake. Thankfully, he decided to retrace his steps, and the moment he did so and returned to the loving embrace of his father, he started to live in affluence again. Beloved, if you have backslidden from God and are already experiencing lack and sorrow, retrace your steps to Him today. Do not admire the things that ungodly people are doing to get wealthy; instead, return to the One who owns all of creation and who gives the power to get true wealth (Deuteronomy 8:18).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make up your mind to stick with God fully for the rest of your life so that you can start enjoying the benefits that come with being a child of God.

In the kingdom of God, however, the real meaning of promotion is more work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I recall many years ago, when I had not yet become the General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, I saw the General Superintendent praying all through the night on one occasion, and I was worried. I thought something terrible had happened, so I asked him what the problem was the following morning. He laughed and said that I would understand much later. Many years later, when I became the General Overseer, I understood because I now pray all night too. As God promotes you in ministry, the work and sacrifices that you need to engage in will increase. For example, I had never spent Father’s Day with my family until 2020, during the coronavirus \u0002induced lockdown. I am also extremely happy whenever I have the opportunity to sleep in my own bed because it now happens very rarely. The amount of time I have to rest now is less than the amount of time I had to do so when The Redeemed Christian Church of God had 100,000 members. When God promotes you in ministry, don’t get excited about it in the flesh. Instead, you should be sober because it means that you have to increase your spiritual capacity so you can be a blessing to more souls. You should seek to draw closer to God rather than waste time rejoicing among men.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a fellow is promoted in God’s Kingdom, it is a call to more and greater responsibilities. Hence, when you see genuine ministers of God being promoted in ministry, don’t envy them. The higher you go in God’s kingdom, the more the good work you must do increases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to know that when God promotes men and gives them greater responsibilities, He also supplies them with a greater measure of grace. You do not have to be scared about greater responsibilities that come with God’s promotion because He will make all grace abound to you as He lifts you higher (2 Corinthians 9:8). As we read earlier in today’s memory verse, Paul said that desiring a higher office in God’s kingdom is good. Therefore, you should desire for God to keep promoting you as you continue to serve Him.</p>",

After this defeat, Joshua went to God and asked for the reason they lost, and God told him that there was sin in the camp of the Israelites (Joshua 7:2-11). This shows us that even when you are doing the will of God, and He has promised to support you all the way, He will withdraw His support the moment you start engaging in sin. Sin will turn a child of God into an enemy of God, and because God's eyes are too pure to behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13), He will withdraw from such a fellow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God made several wonderful promises to Moses. For instance, He told Moses that His presence would go with him and He would give him rest (Exodus 33:14). In Exodus 33:1, He also told Moses to go up with the children of Israel and take them to the Promised Land which He had sworn to give to their fathers – Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. However, when Moses disobeyed God, the Lord withdrew His support, and Moses died in the wilderness (Deuteronomy 34:4-5).

However, after he sat on the throne as king, he became proud and disobedient to God (1 Samuel 15:1-30). This made God to change His mind, withdraw His support, and give the kingdom to David. Samson was also destined for greatness. However, he started living in sin, and he thought God would never leave him. On the day God's support was withdrawn from him, he didn't even know until the enemies had captured him (Judges 16:20).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, are you engaging in anything that will take God's support away from you? If you are engaging in secret sins, desist from them immediately. Don't think that there will not be consequences because things are still going on as usual. God is surely taking records. Repent today before He decides to turn His back on you. May the Lord not withdraw His support from you, in Jesus' name.</p>",

      "<p>Years ago, a vice-principal in a girls’ college in Benin, Southern Nigeria, decreed that anybody who mentioned the name of Jesus in the school would be dealt with. During that period, some of the girls in the college became born again after a university graduate undergoing the mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps programme in the city preached to them. Because their vice-principal had said that nobody must mention the name of Jesus in the school, the girls always met secretly to pray and study the Bible. One day, while having a Bible study session at night on the school field, the vice-principal walked in on them. He promised to expel them during the school assembly the next day because they had disobeyed his decree, and when he got home, he told his wife everything that had happened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the girls ran to the Youth Corp member and told him what had happened. He turned to God and said, “Lord, if anyone is going to be punished, let it be me. Please, don’t let them be expelled.” The following morning, the students and teachers of the school gathered for the school assembly session as usual. The girls were trembling as they waited for the vice-principal to come to the assembly ground and announce their expulsion from the college. The vice\u0002principal’s wife was also expecting that he would soon march to the assembly ground to expel the girls. When she looked at the time and saw that he was running late, she decided to knock on the door of his bedroom to wake him up so he could go for the assembly session before it ended. She knocked repeatedly, but he didn’t answer – God had taken his life overnight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a fellow decides to oppose God’s agenda, he or she might be crushed because God always goes out of His way to support His righteous cause. It is a dangerous thing to stand against what God supports because He is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29). He will consume anything and anyone who opposes His counsel. Ephesians 1:11 says:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the easiest way to get God’s support and to continue enjoying it is to walk in obedience to His will at all times. Ensure that you align yourself with His agenda so that you will not find yourself face-to-face with His wrath.</p>",

      "<p>Many people who are yet to surrender their lives to Christ think that they are enjoying life as they live in sin. For example, they think sleeping around is fun until they contract an incurable disease. A lot of them also think that it is okay to make money through any means, whether good or bad, until the wealth or possession they amass leads to their utter destruction. Being in Christ and living according to His word helps believers to live a lifestyle that protects them from many troubles. Those who are in Christ have access to information that will always give them hope and keep them safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many unbelievers look like they are doing well judging by their lifestyle and appearance; however, in reality, they are suffering. Some of them cannot even sleep soundly because of the evil things they have done. Being in Christ gives you peace and removes fears about the future from your heart. A life without Christ is a life with no hope. Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 2:12:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is because of Christ that believers are assured that no matter what challenges come their way, they will emerge victorious. Jesus said in John 16:33 that in this world, we will have tribulations, but we must be of good cheer because He has already overcome the world for us. Our hope is grounded in God's promises and not just wishful thinking. When you read God’s promises in the Scriptures, they will stir up hope in you. For example, in Hebrews 13:5, He promised to never leave you nor forsake you. This means that no matter what you are going through, God is right there beside you. In Romans 8:28, He said that all things will work together for your good if you love Him and are called according to His purpose. Therefore, if you are a lover of Christ and are walking in His purpose for your life, no matter the challenges you might be facing, you will laugh last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, I want you to rest assured that God is thinking about you, and His thoughts towards you are of peace, and not of evil, to bring you to an expected end (Jeremiah 29:11). I pray that you will always hold on to the hope of glory you have in Christ, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

For the first six days of the cruise, it was like heaven on earth; the sea was calm, the winds blew softly, and the skies were very clear. However, on the seventh day, a storm came! Believe me, you don’t want to be on the ocean when there is a storm. The ship was several stories high, but the waves kept tossing it up and down like paper. Everything on board was shaking, and objects were flying around. It was very terrible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things got so bad that the captain called everyone on board together and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, don’t be worried. There are 12 categories of storms at sea. Category 1 is the mildest, while category 12 is the most turbulent – we are only caught in a category 10 storm.” When I heard that, I became afraid. I turned to God and said, “God, what am I doing here in a category 10 storm? In my village, the biggest river is so small that an amateur swimmer can swim across it.” The captain continued, “Don’t worry, just go back to your cabins.” When I got to my cabin, I asked God, “Lord, what am I going to do now?” He replied, “Son, when I was on earth, and I was in a boat that was caught in a storm, what was I doing?” I responded, “Lord, You were sleeping.” I knew exactly what to do. I immediately jumped on the bed, and in minutes, I was fast asleep. By the time I woke up, we were already at the port, and everything was calm and peaceful. Anytime I tell this story, people ask me, “How could you sleep in such a situation?” I usually think to myself, “What else could I have done, jump into the ocean?” I didn’t even know how to swim; however, I had the kind of peace that only God gives. Also, if I had not learnt to hear God’s voice before the storm, I might have developed high blood pressure due to anxiety for nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are truly a child of God, then He is always with you. You can live a life free of anxiety if you spend quality time with Him daily because you will know His voice, and He will give you His peace – the peace that passes all understanding (Philippians 4:7).</p>",

      "<p>In 1979, I travelled for a Kenneth Hagin camp meeting in Oklahoma, USA. During the meeting, a minister announced the collection of an offering for their Bible College. At that point, a man asked for permission to speak to the congregation. He said, “I want to announce that the sum of what you all give is what my wife and I will give.” There were about 17,000 people in the congregation, and when the offering was summed up, it amounted to 3.5 million dollars. When everyone in the congregation heard this, we all thought that the man was in big trouble. However, he took the microphone and said, “Brethren, is this all you can do?” Where I sat, I said to myself, “This man knows something that I don't, and I'm going to find out what he knows.” As soon as the service ended, I walked up to him and said, “Sir, can I know your secret?” He said, “It is very simple. Five years ago, I started a business with 500 dollars, and I reached an agreement with God that I would not insult him by giving him 10% of the profits. I started giving God 90% while I kept 10% of the profits. Now, I am worth over 50 million dollars, so I know what I am doing.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The law of harvest says that if you sow sparingly, you will reap sparingly. Someone who sows a thousand burnt offerings should automatically know that the result will not be small. A thousand burnt offerings in hundredfold returns will be extremely large. Solomon gave God a thousand burnt offerings in 2 Chronicles 1:6. In 2 Chronicles 7:5, the next time he was going to give an offering, he gave 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep, which means that God must have greatly multiplied his initial seed. That was the law of harvest playing out. In Solomon’s case, he didn’t just get more animals, he got many other things that money cannot buy – wisdom, understanding, peace, and long life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 9:7-8 says that when you give, God is able to make all grace abound towards you. When you check Solomon’s history, throughout his reign, there was not a single war fought against him even though he lived in an era where kings went to war frequently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, honour God by giving to Him, and He will fill your storehouses until they overflow (Proverbs 3:9-10). This is the law of harvest, and it is a promise from God that will never fail.</p>",

      "<p>Many people have misunderstood Genesis 2:2. They feel that God has been resting since it was recorded that He rested on the seventh day after His work of creation. However, in John 5:17, Jesus said, <strong>“My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,”</strong> meaning that God is not idle; He is busy. God is a diligent God, and He never sleeps nor slumbers (Psalm 121:4). When you read through the Bible, you will notice that God always chose diligent people whenever He needed to use men for His agenda on the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you read the account of how Jesus chose His disciples, you will see that they were all busy at work when He called them. Peter was fishing in his boat, and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee (Mark 1:16-20). Matthew was sitting at a tax collector’s booth when Jesus asked him to follow Him (Matthew 9:9). God never calls or anoints lazy people; He calls diligent and prudent people because He hates laziness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lazy people cannot get the best from God. This is because they will waste whatever resources He gives to them, and He doesn’t like wastage. Whatever is in the hands of a lazy person will not be maintained or nurtured properly. In Proverbs 24:30-31, Solomon said:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a fellow’s room is always rough and dirty, that is a sign that he or she is lazy. If a person does not always meet up with his or her deliverables at work, school, or in ministry, it is also a sign of laziness. Another symptom of laziness is recorded in Proverbs 26:13:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a person always talks about doing something important, but he or she is always giving one excuse or the other for not doing it yet, it means that he or she is lazy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God will not give you His resources or take you to great heights if you are lazy. Evaluate your life in all humility, and if you find any of the symptoms of laziness that I discussed above, make genuine efforts to effect the necessary changes today and make diligence your watchword from henceforth.</p>",

Paul was so disappointed that in Acts 15:36-41, he insisted that he and Barnabas should not take John Mark with them when they wanted to go on another missionary journey. However, in 2 Timothy 4:9-11, the same Paul who didn’t want John Mark to accompany him on another missionary journey said, “Bring him to me for he is profitable.” It is that same John Mark who ended up writing the gospel of Mark in the New Testament. When a fellow keeps growing and developing himself or herself, those who rejected such a fellow before will turn to embrace him or her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul said that when he was a child, he spoke, understood, and thought as a child, but when he became a man, he put away childish things (1 Corinthians 13:11). Everyone starts as a child, but it is not okay to remain as one. Anyone who is not growing is dying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a child of God, one important aspect you must grow in is your character.

Jesus talked about people with no faith in Mark 4:40 and people with faith like a mustard seed in Luke 17:6. This means that faith can grow. If you started with a mustard seed faith, as powerful as it is, you should not remain on that level; instead, you should move on to having great faith (Matthew 15:28). You should not still be afraid of sicknesses and demons if you are truly growing in Christ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you were not saved to live in fear and weakness. You are not meant to be just a spectator of the wonderful things that God does through His children. You must grow in faith to the point where you can heal the sick, cast out demons, and raise the dead. Immerse yourself in the word of God regularly (Romans 10:17), pray in the Holy Ghost continually (Jude 1:20), and covet the best gifts from the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:31).

If all they put in are worldly pleasures, then there will be no greatness; however, if they are diligent, they will be prosperous (Proverbs 12:24).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My Father in the Lord told a story of two young men who went to consult an oracle to find out what the future held for them. The oracle told one of them that he would become a king and the other that he would be a servant. The one the oracle predicted to become a king immediately began to act pompously, while the second one said to himself, “What have I done to deserve this fate? Why must I be a servant?” He kept thinking about what the oracle said, and he became angry. When he got home, he took his cutlass and hoes, went far into the jungle, and began to cultivate a portion of the jungle. He would wake up every morning to clear bushes and plant seeds until late at night. Whenever he felt pain, he would tell his body, “You cannot be tired because I refuse to be a slave.” Years passed, and he kept on expanding the farm. After a while, there was a famine in his town. The townspeople spent all their money and didn’t have any food to eat. One day, a hunter went far into the jungle to look for meat and he stumbled on this young man’s store of food. He went back to his townspeople to tell them what he had found and they all came there too. They did not have money to buy the food so they begged the young man to please give them food and they will serve him. He agreed and they crowned him as their king. One day, as he sat on his throne, the other man who the oracle said would become a king came begging and said, “Please don’t let me die of hunger; give me food and I will be your servant.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, whatever you sow into your life is what you will reap. If you put in diligence, you will reap abundance because the soul of the diligent shall be made fat (Proverbs 13:4). If you sow to your flesh, you will reap corruption, as we see in today’s memory verse. If you want the best in life, you must put in the best, and having Jesus in control of your life is the best you can ever have.

      "<p>Someone once said that the world is a school, and those who are wise go to school to take lessons every day because there is always something to learn there. Proverbs 9:9 says that if you give instructions to a wise man, he will become wiser. You must be open to learning from others because everyone has something to teach you, even children. A teachable fellow is always willing and ready to learn. Mark 4:25 says;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who is willing to learn every day will have more understanding and wisdom. A teachable fellow is open to knowledge and is always willing to add other people’s wisdom to his or her own. When you are teachable, you learn mainly through instructions, not by experience. For example, if you keep telling a boy not to put his hand in a fire and you constantly keep him away from hot objects, if the boy is not teachable, he will always want to run towards what you are trying to save him from. One day, he might eventually put his hand in the fire and get hurt. However, a teachable child will listen to instructions, obey them, and grow in wisdom. He or she will not have to experience the pain that comes from disobedience by nursing wounds that could have been avoided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David was a very teachable fellow. Many times in the Bible, he prayed and asked God to teach him; He was always willing to learn. In Psalm 25:4, he asked God to teach him His paths. When you are open to learning about God’s paths, you can never miss your way. In Psalm 119:26 and Psalm 119:33, he asked God to teach him His statutes so that he could keep them until his death. In Psalm 119:66, he wanted to learn good judgment and knowledge. Also, he asked God to teach him to do His will in Psalm 143:10.

      "<p>There are people who used to be wealthy or influential but have little or nothing to show for it today. There is nothing as terrible as being a fellow who used to be wealthy or influential. For example, when those who have never had a car struggle to enter a public bus and someone steps on them, they would see it as something normal. However, people who used to have their own cars might find it difficult to adapt when they find themselves in a similar situation. Also, if they complain about getting stepped on while struggling to enter a public bus, they might feel really insulted when people say, “If you don’t want to be stepped on, why not get your own car?” May you never be a has-been, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is nothing as terrible as being an ex-champion. Boxers will tell you that the moment you become a champion, other boxers in your category will want to challenge you to a fight. If you want to remain a champion, it means that you need to work harder than you used to before you became a champion. If you relax after becoming successful, saying, “I am the best; everybody already sees how good I am,” you might soon lose your edge and become irrelevant. Instead, you must start working harder on becoming more excellent. The things you need to do to remain at the top are even more rigorous than what you must do to get there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God called me to become a pastor, I prayed that I would become so influential for the kingdom, and I can tell you with all confidence that the way I used to pray before I got to the level I am now is nothing compared to how I pray now.

This is how I have been able to maintain an upward trajectory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you want to be the best in your field, you must be ready to put in all the necessary efforts. Most importantly, to remain at the top, you must be ready to put in even more efforts by acquiring more and more knowledge, networking more with other experts in your field, and generally working harder. I pray that you will get to the top and remain there, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

I made the decision by faith as I was a pastor and did not have a secular job. I announced that everyone would be fed twice daily during conventions and I showed them 1 Kings 17:4-6 where God fed Elijah twice daily. One of the young men in the church, a baker, volunteered to provide us with bread for breakfast during our conventions, and he did this consistently for some years. One year, however, he decided that he would stop supplying bread because he didn’t like one of the sermons I had preached, but he didn’t inform me of his decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During one of the morning sessions that year, we sang and praised God until around 11am as we waited for bread to arrive; however, no bread was supplied. Around noon, I sent for him and asked, “What happened? Did the vehicles bringing the bread break down on the way here?” He said, “No”. Then, I asked him what the problem was, and he replied, “I am not bringing bread anymore.” Immediately, I sent for my wife and asked her, “How much do we have for the evening meal?” We gathered the money together and bought bread for breakfast. Somehow, God helped us to overcome the situation. Years later, I woke up one morning and saw the young baker in front of my house. I asked him, “What can I do for you? You are here very early.” He replied, “I could have come earlier, but I discovered that one of my car’s tyres was flat.” I asked him, “What about the spare tyre?” He said that he had none. This was a man who used to have at least 14 cars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, don’t think that you can take God for granted because He is doing some great things through you now. Don’t think that He cannot do without you; in contrast, it is you who cannot do anything without Him and will be nothing without Him, as we see in today’s memory verse. Only foolish people will take the people in power in their country for granted. Therefore, imagine taking the One who is in control of the entire universe (Colossians 1:16-17) for granted. God is way bigger than you, so if you have been taking Him for granted in any way or you have not been honouring Him as you should, repent now.</p>",

We prayed a simple prayer, and immediately, he was healed. He was able to kneel, raise his hands, clap, and move his body in ways he couldn’t do before. For about two weeks, he was regular at church services, but after that, he stopped coming. We decided to follow him up, so we visited him at home and asked why he had not been coming to church. He responded by asking us if it was the church that healed him. We told him, “Of course not; it was God, but He used the church.” Then He said, “What then is the problem? If you go to a hospital and you get well, won’t you go home? I came to your church, and I got healed. There is no need for me to keep coming back.” We eventually left him alone, and some months later, as I was driving by, I saw him by the roadside in a worse condition than he was before his initial healing. This time, not only was his entire body stiff, his mouth was wide open, and saliva was dripping uncontrollably from it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One thing about demons is that they don’t rest. When a demon’s host runs to God and gets delivered from the demon, after some time, it will return to see the state of the fellow. If it sees that the fellow, having received his or her miracle, has decided that he or she doesn’t need God again, it will invite seven more demons that are stronger than it to possess the fellow again. Eventually, the fellow who thought that he or she could use God just to get healed will realise that his or her case has become worse (Matthew 12:43-45).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some men who are living wayward lives join churches because they want to get married to good Christian ladies. However, they often discover, after getting married, that they have been deceived into marrying someone like themselves who is not genuinely born-again, and also came to the church to look for a Christian husband.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, in my over 50 years of walking with God, I have discovered that people who think that they can use God and turn their backs on Him always regret it.

This means that if God sends His word to a fellow and that fellow refuses to accept it, that word will go to someone else because God’s word can not, and will not, return to Him without accomplishing what it has been sent to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if this same word dwells in your heart, you can use it to accomplish great and mighty things to the glory of God.

When something settles somewhere, it has found a conducive resting place there. When Noah sent out a dove after the flood, the Bible says that the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to the ark (Genesis 8:9). Until you make room for God’s word in your heart, it cannot settle in you. God’s word will settle difficult situations in your life and the lives of others if you let it dwell richly in your heart. People are often called rich because they have lots of money. Those who have only a few thousands in their bank accounts cannot claim to be rich. Similarly, you cannot claim to be rich in God’s word when you know only a few verses in the Bible. You must immerse yourself in God’s word and allow it to fill every part of your being by reading and studying it daily. Never be satisfied with yesterday’s revelation; seek to know God’s word anew daily. His word will dwell richly in you as you meditate on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a cook wants a lump of meat to fully absorb some seasonings, he or she will soak the meat in the seasonings for hours to marinate it before cooking.

This way, whenever you speak it into any situation, God will surely back it up.</p>",

In Judges 14:5-6, Samson was going down to Timnath when a lion roared at him. The anointing came on him, and he tore the lion in half with his bare hands. In Judges 15:14-15, it was also Samson’s hands that grabbed the jawbone of an ass and turned it into a weapon of mass destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An anointed person’s head is like an electricity generator, and the fellow’s hands can be likened to wires that conduct electricity to where it is needed. The anointing on a person’s head determines the power the fellow carries in his or her hands. One day, I was in a store abroad buying books, and as is my custom, I was singing choruses while picking the books off the shelves. After a while, a man came to me smiling, and he said, “It must be such a lovely day, seeing how happily you are singing.” I laughed and shook his hand because he had extended it for a handshake. As he turned to leave, he exclaimed, “What just happened? It is gone!” Apparently, he had been suffering a backache for years, but as he shook my hand, the pain disappeared. A casual handshake resulted in a miracle because my hands conducted the anointing upon my head into the needed vessel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, you need God’s anointing upon your head if you want His power to flow through your hands. You must spend quality time in fellowship with God so that He will anoint you. When God anoints you, you will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover. As a believer, your hands must be actively doing God’s work. When you see sick people, lay hands on them. Don’t withdraw your hands from doing God’s work because the anointing you carry will remain dormant if your hands are not taking it to where it is needed. The more you lay hands on the sick, the more demand you will place on the anointing upon your life, and the more it will grow. As the anointing upon your life grows, God will trust you to handle bigger things because He knows that your hands will deliver the things that He wants to do.</p>",

In Exodus 17:8-13, when Moses lifted up his hands on a hilltop, Israel prevailed over their enemies; however, when he became tired and dropped his hands, Israel started losing. In Exodus 14:21- 28, Moses’ hands did something extraordinary; He stretched his hand over the sea, a strong east wind blew, and a way was created where there was none before. The east wind is another reference for the Holy Spirit in the Bible. This means that a believer’s hands can determine how the Holy Spirit moves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1981, after I had just become the General Overseer of RCCG, I travelled to Ifewara, my hometown in South-West Nigeria. Then, there was no direct road linking Ife, a major city in the South-West region, to Ifewara. To get to Ifewara, one would have to take a route through Ilesha, a smaller city within the region, making it an extra 70-kilometre journey. When I eventually got to my hometown, I told my people to make a request to God, and they asked for a motorable road linking Ifewara to Ife. I asked them where exactly they wanted the road to be built, and they pointed it out. I lifted my hand and said, “In the name of Jesus, let there be a road.” Six months later, the government decided to build a road from Ife to Ifewara. There was no logical or political reason to do so, and they didn’t build it to get votes because it was during a military regime; they built it because God found a hand that He could use to create a way where there was none.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God needs your hands to perform great miracles on the earth. Psalm 24:4 says that only those who have clean hands can ascend unto the Lord’s hill. Are your hands clean enough for God to use? Can He use them as channels to do His will on earth? You must not put your hands into anything that has an appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22). Don’t use your hands to give or collect bribes; it will grieve the Holy Spirit. Don’t use them to engage in fornication or doctor figures to illegally enrich yourself; that will also grieve the Holy Spirit.

God showed Moses a tree, and he cut a branch from it, threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. I believe that if it had been someone else who threw that branch in the water, nothing would have changed. In 2 Kings 4:38-41, somebody unknowingly added a poisonous herb to the food that was being prepared for the sons of the prophets. Upon tasting it, they said, “There is death in the pot.” Elisha then said, “Bring me some flour.” He put the flour in the pot, and the poison was neutralised. The flour became a potent antidote because the anointing flowed through the hands that poured it into the pot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, I travelled to Lokoja, a state capital in Central Nigeria, and I saw a huge tree on a major road within the city. The road was built around the tree, and when I asked why, I was told that the tree could not be uprooted because there were evil forces surrounding it. Quietly, I stretched my hand towards the tree and prayed a simple prayer. That night, there was a violent storm, and by the next morning, the tree had been uprooted. I decree that any tree that God has not planted in your life, family, or city will be uprooted today, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God performed special miracles by the hands of Paul. Handkerchiefs and aprons were taken from his body to heal the sick and deliver those who were oppressed by demons (Acts 19:11-12). Pieces of cloth that had come in contact with Paul’s hands and aprons that had come in contact with his body became healing vessels and demon chasers. In today’s Bible reading, the inhabitants of Jericho told Elisha that their city was pleasant, but the ground was barren, and the water was bad. He took some salt and poured it at the source of the water flowing into the city, and the waters became fit for use. It wasn’t the salt that performed the miracle; it was the hand of the anointed fellow that threw in the salt. Beloved, I decree that as you raise your hands, any curse on your life, family, village, town, or country will be broken, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

Children can walk up to their fathers anytime to ask questions and make requests, but dogs cannot. While a child can sit with his or her father on the dining table to eat, a dog usually sits under the table to eat crumbs. Such dogs will go hungry if there are no crumbs. If you have not yet surrendered your heart to Jesus, you are not yet God’s child, and now is the best time to turn to Him and allow Him to become your Father.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God has numerous names; He is the King of kings and Lord of lords (Revelation 19:16), He is the Almighty (Job 23:16), and He is the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last (Revelation 22:13). Despite all His names, when Jesus taught us to pray in Luke 11:1-2, He said that we should start by saying, “Our Father”. The name God loves to be called the most is Father. As Father, God is our source and sustainer; He is our helper. No responsible father will see his children suffering and leave them to continue to suffer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was a child, I often followed my father to his farm. We always had to cross a particular river on our way back, and occasionally, the river overflowed its banks. Whenever this happened, it would sweep the bridge that was built across the river away. On one occasion that this happened, my father picked me up and carried me across the river on his shoulders because I was too small to walk on the riverbed and not be swept away by the currents. While he was walking through the river, I was playing with the water because I was on his shoulder. If an earthly father can do everything to protect his child, how much more our heavenly Father?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are already a child of God and are experiencing challenges that are currently testing your faith, hold on to God; He is a loving Father, and He will surely see you through and bring you to an expected end (Jeremiah 29:11). If you are, however, yet to surrender your life to Him and you want to experience His special love and care, then accept His invitation to become His child today, and you too will enjoy peace on all sides, in Jesus’ name.</p>",

      "<p>There are about one hundred billion stars in the galaxy, and God calls them all by their names (Psalm 147:4). The Bible even mentions Orion, a constellation of stars (Amos 5:8), and Wormwood (Revelation 8:11). Among all the stars, God gave a special assignment to one of them. We don’t know the star’s name, but God surely knows it, and He must have called that star by its name and commissioned it to lead the wise men to Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s Bible reading, the wise men, who were probably astrologers, talked about a star that they saw in the sky and how they knew that it belonged to a king. They followed the star all the way from their country to Israel, and as long as they followed it, it led them on the right track. If they had stopped following the star, they would have surely lost their way and begun to wander in darkness and confusion. People who celebrate Christmas without having Jesus can be said to be wandering in the dark. They can eat, drink, and be merry, but they will remain in darkness. You do not have to continue dwelling in darkness if you are like this. Jesus has come as the light of the world (John 8:12) to illuminate every place where there is darkness in your life. As the world celebrates his birth today, this is the perfect time to give your life to Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as the wise men left Jerusalem and resumed their search for the King, the star led them to where Jesus was (Matthew 2:9). That star fulfilled its mission of leading the wise men to the Bright and Morning Star, Jesus. Every believer is like that star, called and commissioned to lead others to Jesus. As a believer, even as you celebrate the birth of Jesus today, do not forget that you are on a mission to lead others to Him. That star is still being spoken of today because it fulfilled its mission to lead the wise men to Jesus. As long as you keep leading and influencing others to follow Jesus, you will remain relevant in God’s agenda. Our Lord Jesus is the Bright and Morning Star, and your life should lead others to Him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are yet to give your life to Jesus, do so today. He is waiting for you to come to Him because He wants to set you free from the tyranny of darkness and confusion. Merry Christmas!</p>",

      "<p>Today’s Bible reading tells us about a young man who was very comfortable in his father’s house and had nothing to worry about until he probably started listening to the wrong voices. He became discontent and demanded his share of the inheritance from his father. When people begin to listen to the wrong voices, they often start making wrong decisions. You must always ensure that you listen to the right voice – God’s voice. To know how God speaks and the things He says, you must read and understand His word. Only those who constantly read and meditate on God’s word will escape the deception of these end times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the prodigal son was leaving his father’s house, he said, “Father, give me…” His request landed him far away from his father, and even though he seemed to enjoy himself for a while after that, his happiness did not last. He soon became poor, and since he was in a strange land, he suffered greatly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, the prodigal son came to his senses and realised that he could not make himself, meaning that he needed his father to succeed in life. He was in a haste to be made, but he needed to let his father take him through the right process. God is a God of process, and He always wants to make His children whom He desires them to be. Whenever a chef is making a meal, the process is not usually as attractive as the end product. For instance, the heating process is usually unpleasant. However, the ingredients that endure the heat will become fit to grace a king’s table. Those that don’t go in the fire usually end up as trash or food for pests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God was making Moses, He made him stay in the desert for forty years, tending to his father-in-law’s flock (Exodus 3:1). It couldn’t have been a pleasant experience for a man who had lived in the palace all his life, but the process helped to shape him into a tough leader who could confront Pharaoh, a man considered as the most powerful king on earth at the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus called His disciples to make them (Mark 1:17). When He was done making them, the Pharisees and religious leaders marvelled because even though they were unlearned, they had become a wonder (Acts 4:13). Beloved, surrender yourself completely to God and let Him make you. When He is done, you will become a wonder to your family, friends, and the world at large.</p>",

      "<p>Yesterday, I discussed the story of the prodigal son and how he returned home to his father when he realised he could not make himself. Today, I will examine the lives of Jesus’ disciples and how He made all of them, except Judas Iscariot. When Jesus called His disciples in today’s memory verse, He said, “<strong>Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”</strong> For example, by the time He was done with Peter, Peter became so famous and influential that today, over 2,000 years later, we are still talking about him. Those who allowed God to make them in the Scriptures have remained relevant up until now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When God makes a fellow, He adorns the fellow with beauty and glory and gives him or her a purpose for living. Jesus told His disciples that by following Him, they would become fishers of men. He fulfilled this promise, and they all became great fishers of men (Acts 2:41, Acts 4:4), and He kept them all until the end, except the son of perdition (John 17:12). All these happened because they followed Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God cannot make you when you are not following Him consistently. Just because you followed Him yesterday doesn’t mean that you can live life by yourself today. Following Him is a daily decision. A famous songwriter once wrote, “I have decided to follow Jesus; no turning back, no turning back.” When you truly follow Jesus, it will be evident in your words, actions, and lifestyle. After the disciples had followed Jesus for some time, the religious leaders observed them and noted that they had truly been with Jesus (Acts 4:13). If you truly follow Jesus, it will be evident for people to see. When you leave raw meat on fire to cook, for example, no matter how tough it is, it will eventually become soft. Sadly, many believers attend church services and other Christian programmes frequently; however, there is no tangible change in their behaviour and attitude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is time to follow Jesus wholeheartedly and allow Him to make you if you haven’t done so yet. It is time to let go of all forms of worldliness in your life; lay them aside, and follow Jesus. Jesus makes only those who follow Him. He purifies and prunes only the branches that abide in Him (John 15:2). Don’t waste your life chasing meaningless things; follow Jesus and let Him make you who He has destined you to become.</p>",

      "<p>Years ago, a devout Muslim heard the gospel during one of our programmes and became born again. He was overwhelmed with joy, and we rejoiced with him. Three days later, he came to me and asked, “Are you sure Jesus can forgive all sins?” I said, “Yes”. He said, “You have not heard all that I have done. The evil I have done is so much, and I don’t think He can forgive everything.” I asked him, “Have you given your life to Him?” He said, “Yes”. I responded, “Please, go home rejoicing; Jesus has forgiven all.” After another three days, he returned and said, “You have not heard everything I did.” Then, he proceeded to recount various sins that he had committed. I told him that once people give their lives to Christ, God gives them brand-new beginnings. He kept coming back to me with doubts about specific sins that he thought were too big for Jesus to forgive until one day, he said, “If Jesus can forgive this sin that I’m about to tell you, then I won’t worry anymore. I needed a man’s heart to make a charm. A young relative died, and I went to his grave at night, exhumed his body, and cut out his heart for the charm. Do you think Jesus can forgive that?” I opened my Bible and showed him 1 John 1:7, which reads, <strong>“…and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”</strong> I then asked him, “What is the meaning of all?” After a while, he replied, “I think all means all.” I said, “That is correct. It doesn’t matter how many sins you have committed up until now. The moment you give your life to Jesus, God forgives you of them all. No sin is too big for God to forgive.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David knew the limitless extent of God’s forgiveness, and he wrote in Psalm 103:12 that God removes our transgressions from us as far as the East is from the West. Whenever David asked God to forgive him and cleanse him of his sins, God always did so. All God wants from you whenever you fall into sin is your sincere repentance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when you truly repent of your sins, He is faithful and just to forgive you (1 John 1:9). True repentance is when a fellow stops engaging in sinful acts after God forgives him or her. God’s mercy is truly without limits; however, His forgiving nature should birth a changed heart in you.</p>",

      "<p>Today’s memory verse tells us that God is the Father of mercies. This means that He is not only merciful but the source of mercy. God is rich in mercy (Ephesians 2:4), and His mercy is renewed every day (Lamentations 3:22-23), implying that His mercy is unlimited. God’s mercy can transform every aspect of a believer’s life that needs transformation. For instance, if a believer has health challenges or financial problems, God’s mercy can conveniently turn the believer’s situation around. His mercy is not one-sided; it is multi-dimensional and perfect. When the Father of mercies shows up in a fellow’s life, He can restore any opportunities that he or she might have lost and make everything new for such a fellow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. </strong>Romans 9:15-16</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can see that even though God’s mercies are unlimited, they are not accessible to everyone because God Himself decides the people He shows His mercy. Before God can dispense His unlimited mercies on a fellow, the fellow needs to acknowledge Him as his or her Father. As the Father of mercies, He only releases His unlimited mercies to His children. While it is true that He causes the sun to shine on everyone, both good and bad (Matthew 5:45), there are certain levels of His mercies that He has reserved only for His children. If you are truly God’s child, your relationship with Him will give you access to His everlasting mercies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only God’s children have access to the full complement of His mercies; those who are not His children can only enjoy crumbs. God’s mercy is rich and multi-dimensional; however, a fellow must become His child to enjoy them. To unbelievers, He is a consuming fire, but to His children, He is compassionate and slow to anger (Psalm 145:8).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if you are not yet born again, do not waste another minute outside the tender arms of the Father of mercies. He alone can give you a rich and fulfilling life on earth and guarantee your place in His kingdom for all eternity. If you are already His child, live in obedience to His will, and He will shower you with His abundant mercies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Storms arose during the year, and fierce winds blew, but God kept you safe. He preserved your life despite the enemy’s attempts to destroy you. I want you to take some minutes to truly praise the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If 2025 has been a really good year for you, I want to tell you that there are better days ahead. God is about to give you a new book with 365 blank pages! His thoughts towards you are always good (Jeremiah 29:11), and He has gone ahead of you to make 2026 a blessed year for you. Did you experience some unpleasant events this year? Cheer up; God is making all things new. My Daddy will restore anything that you might have lost (Joel 2:25), and He will give you a fresh start in 2026, in Jesus’ name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as you transition into 2026, I want you to do the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Reflect deeply on all God has done for you, and thank Him abundantly. It is because of Him that you are still standing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Forget everything that has happened to you in the past. You cannot move forward if your gaze is fixed on what is behind you. If you had numerous achievements in 2025, you need to keep pressing forward like Paul because there is so much more to achieve (Philippians 3:13-14). On the other hand, if you experienced many failures, stop counting your losses. Look unto Jesus; He will surely give you good success in 2026 (Psalm 121:1-2).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Abstain from every appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22). You cannot triumph over the roadblocks and traps the enemy has set for you if you allow sin into your life. Sin will keep you from progressing into God’s great plans for you in 2026. Do not allow the devil to cheat you of God’s best for you in the coming year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Fix your gaze on Jesus; you need Him now more than ever. Allow Him to hold your hands, obey His instructions completely, and it will be well with You. Only those who are willing to follow Him wholeheartedly and are obedient to all His instructions shall eat the good of 2026 (Isaiah 1:19).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God has wonderful things in store for you in the next 365 days. In the name that is above all other names, I pray that you will not miss God’s best for you in 2026. Your life will not be cut short, and your eyes will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, in Jesus’ name.</p>",
