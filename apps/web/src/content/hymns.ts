      "1. All hail the power of Jesus’ Name!<br>Let angels prostrate fall;<br>Bring forth the royal diadem,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br>Bring forth the royal diadem,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>2. Let highborn seraphs tune the lyre,<br>and as they tune it, fall<br>Before His face Who tunes their choir,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br>Before His face Who tunes their choir,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>3.Crown Him, ye morning stars of light,<br>Who fixed this floating ball;<br>Now hail the strength of Israel’s might,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br>Now hail the strength of Israel’s might,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>4.Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,<br>who from His altar call;<br>Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br>Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>5.Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,<br>ye ransomed from the fall,<br>Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,<br> and crown Him Lord of all.<br>Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>6.Hail Him, ye heirs of David’s line,<br>Whom David Lord did call,<br>The God incarnate, Man divine,<br>and crown Him Lord of all,<br>The God incarnate, Man divine,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>7.Sinners, whose love can ne’er forget<br>the wormwood and the gall,<br>Go spread your trophies at His feet,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br>Go spread your trophies at His feet,<br>and crown Him Lord of all.<br><br>8.Let every tribe and every tongue<br>before Him prostrate fall<br>And shout in universal song<br>the crowned Lord of all.<br>And shout in universal song<br>the crowned Lord of all",
