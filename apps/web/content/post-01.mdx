title: Judging The Anointed?
date: 2024-04-08
verse: “Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up for God is able to make him stand.” – Romans 14:4 (KJV)
reading: Numbers 12:1-16 (KJV)
point: Leave the judgement of anointed ministers who cheat you to God.

Yesterday, I made it clear that the anointed is not to be dishonoured for any reason. Now, the question someone may have in mind is, “What do we do with ministers of God who we believe to be erring?” This is a very delicate situation that requires God’s wisdom and direction. For example, in our Bible reading today, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of something they believed he did wrong. At the end of the day, Miriam became leprous and Moses had to pray to God for her to be healed.
<br/>

It is not in your place to judge God’s servants; leave their judgments to their Master. In Romans 12:19, the Bible says clearly that vengeance is His, just report the matter to God, and He will deal with His anointed as He pleases.
<br/>

Anointed ministers of God cannot hide under the canopy of being God’s anointed and begin to treat His sheep the way they like. Hebrews 10:31 says that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; believe me, a fellow should not experience God dealing with him or her Himself. The reason we discipline erring workers is to shield them from God doing it Himself. When a pastor misbehaves, and the General Overseer suspends him, it is so that the Consuming Fire Himself will not be the one to do it. So, if a pastor overlooks a fellow’s wrongdoings because of his or her contributions to the church treasury, that pastor is doing more harm than good because God Himself will come in, and nobody wants to fall into the hands of the living God.
<br/>

In 2 Samuel 11, David used his position to snatch another man’s wife and also got him killed. Nobody could punish him as there was no one who was superior to the king. God had to step in to punish him. From that point on, there was no peace in David’s home. Not long after, one of his sons, Amnon, raped his half-sister, and then another son, Absalom, killed him. Later, Absalom rose up against his father. To date, the sword has not departed from Israel on account of the Lord’s judgement over David (2 Samuel 12:9-10).

When a person is anointed by God and uses that anointing to cheat others, when God punishes that fellow, the punishment might last throughout his or her lineage from generation to generation.
