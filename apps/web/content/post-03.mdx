Specifically, the morning of a man stands for his youth. In **1 John 2:14** *“I have written to you young ones because you are strong.”* The major characteristic of youths is their strength. I know most youths see their youthful days as days to enjoy themselves. This is true, according to **Ecclesiastes 11:9-10**: 
> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth…but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment…

Note that the above passage also says that youths will account for the seeds they sow later in life. Those that spend their youthful days engaging in all sorts of vices will reap plenty of trouble later in life (**Galatians 6:7**). In **Genesis 49:1-4**, when Israel was about to die, he called his children together and began to prophesy about their future. He said concerning Reuben, *“Mighty Reuben, excellency of strength… but you will not excel.”* Why did he say this? In **Genesis 35:22**, Reuben did something that he should not have done, and his father heard about it. Now, when his father was about to die, he told him he would not excel, even though he was the firstborn. When you read **Revelation 7:1-5**, you’ll be amazed that by the time they were listing the children of Israel who were sealed, Reuben was no longer the first.

Beloved, if you are young now, meaning that you’re less than 30 years old, make good use of your youth. Be careful of the kinds of seeds you sow now because you will reap their fruits later, and the harvest is always greater than the seed sown.

> …I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. **1 John 2:14**

The above passage does not only say that you are strong as a youth, but also that the word of God is to abide in you, and you are to overcome the wicked one. Your youthful days are the days to soak in the word of God like never before. This is the time to memorise as many scriptures as possible. Now is the time to build your spiritual strength to stand against the devil and overcome him. Use your strength to do a lot for God because a time will come when you will discover that being a youth does not last forever.

<strong>KEY POINT<br/></strong>
Dedicate your youth to knowing and serving God without limits.
