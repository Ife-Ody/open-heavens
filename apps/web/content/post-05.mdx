> **15** Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
> **16** And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
> **17** But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.

If you are above 50, you are already in the second half of your day, and you need to apply wisdom more than ever before. By evening, you are supposed to be relying more on wisdom, not on strength as the flood might have subsided. You may refer to yesterday’s teaching to understand what I mean by the flood. **Job 12:12** says that wisdom is supposed to be with the ancient; years are supposed to teach wisdom. **Job 32:7** says that days should speak and multitudes of years should teach wisdom. This is why it is said that a fool at 40 is a fool forever. You are supposed to have become wise by the time you are 40 because as people grow older, they naturally become weaker.

Nobody will believe, except those who are close to me, that I used to be a boxer. Nobody will believe that there was a time I could carry a bag of cement in one hand and another in the second and say that I was balancing the equation. Now, even with two hands, I will think twice before I pick up a bag of cement.

In **2 Samuel 21:15-17**, the Bible says that David waxed faint. This was the same person who killed a lion and a bear (**1 Samuel 17:34-35**). He was the same person that delivered 200 foreskins when he was asked to get a hundred (**1 Samuel 18:25-27**). David, the giant killer, the one who single-handedly cut off Goliath’s head, waxed faint, and he would have been killed in battle if somebody had not come to his aid. What lesson can we learn from that? When David was at his peak, he had prepared for the time he would grow faint. In **1 Samuel 22:1-2**, when he was in the cave of Adullam, he gathered some vagabonds and turned them into mighty men. It was one of his boys that was there to help him when his evening came.

In **2 Samuel 23:1-39**, we read of the people he had prepared who were now called *‘David’s mighty men’*. These men risked their lives by taking on an entire army just to get him water to drink. If you are in your flood age, you should prepare disciples when things are going very smoothly. Are you preparing for those days when the flood will be gone? What arrangements are you making during your daytime because the night is coming? I am speaking in proverbs, but a word is enough for the wise.
