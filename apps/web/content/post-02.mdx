In Genesis 1:1-5, God called the light ‘day’ and the darkness ‘night’. The combination of both gave us the first day. When you dig deeper, you will discover that a day is broken into three parts – morning, afternoon and evening. In Psalm 55:17, David said, “Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.” Day is God’s unit of measuring the time of man on earth. Psalm 90:12 says, “Teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.” Proverbs 10:27 tells us that although God can lengthen a fellow’s days, He can also shorten them.

According to the memory verse for today, the morning is the time for growing up, and it is the time for joy (Psalm 30:5). When you are growing up as a child, you have no responsibilities. When children wake up in the morning, they want breakfast to be on the table, and how it gets there is none of their business. Listen to a child laugh, and you will also begin to laugh because their laughter is right from the inside. The afternoon is when you are at your peak, and the sun is at its brightest. Job 11:17 talks about age being clearer than the noonday. The noon is the peak of life. The evening is when things begin to become dim, and the sun is about to set. (1 Samuel 4:15) says that Eli was 98 years old and his eyes waxed dim. Psalm 104:23 says that man goes to his work and begins to return home in the evening. Your evening is when you begin to round off your life.

It is pertinent to know which part of your day you are in so that you can act wisely and make the best out of it. However, if you don’t know, you could be trying to achieve good results with the wrong method. This is why those who fear God are called wise because even though they grow old, they have wisdom and can still do what strong people cannot. There is a time to use strength primarily, and there is a time to use less of strength and more of wisdom. There is a time to run and a time to pass the baton. You must recognise your times and seasons to make the best out of your life.
