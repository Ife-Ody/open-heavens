# Directory-Scoped Types

When defining types for a component that is a directory which contains logic relating to the component, it is better to create a types.ts file that will contain all the types needed for relating to the component.

## Examples

For a component with its own directory:

```
/components
  /user-profile
    /index.tsx       # Main component
    /user-avatar.tsx # Sub-component
    /user-info.tsx   # Sub-component
    /types.ts        # Contains all types for the component
```

Example types.ts content:
```tsx
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar?: string;
}

export interface UserProfileProps {
  user: User;
  showAvatar?: boolean;
  editable?: boolean;
}

export interface UserAvatarProps {
  src?: string;
  alt: string;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
}
```

This keeps all related types in one place and makes them easier to maintain and import.
