# UI Components

This project uses a mix of custom UI components and shared components from `@repo/ui` package.

## Using Shared UI Components
- Import UI components from the shared package:
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from "@repo/ui";
  ```
- Prefer shared components over custom ones for consistency

## Custom UI Components
- Place custom, reusable UI components in `/src/components/ui`
- Follow the `@repo/ui` component patterns for consistency
- Use composition over inheritance for component variants

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components
- For complex components, consider using a combination of:
  - Tailwind classes
  - CSS variables for theming
  - CSS Modules for component-specific styles that are hard to express in Tailwind
  
## Responsive Design
- Design mobile-first using Tailwind breakpoints
- Test components at various screen sizes
- Use fluid typography and spacing where appropriate
