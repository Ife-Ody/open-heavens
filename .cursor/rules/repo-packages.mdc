- Built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Use these components to maintain design consistency

- Provides access to Bible references, verses, and search functionality
- Used for handling Bible content in the applications

## @repo/eslint-config

- Ensures consistent code style across the monorepo
- Do not modify unless updating linting rules for the entire project

## @repo/typescript-config
- Shared TypeScript configuration
